        "Pub Name": "Cock",
        "Address": "23 High Street, Broom, SG18 9NA",
        "Description": "This village pub has changed over the years and now has five small rooms. It still has no bar counter - and is one of only six traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.\n\r\nThe Cock occupies\u00a0a mid-19th-century row of cottages converted into alehouse and later a pub. Owned by Ballards, it was sold to Wells & Winch of Biggleswade, who were taken over by Greene King in 1961. It has grown from a single room with beer fetched from the cellar but retains a sense of its traditional character. At one time the only public drinking area was\u00a0the left-hand room (now the games room with table skittles). Drinks were then brought, as they still are, from the top of the steps.\n\r\nThe room on the right-hand side was formerly\u00a0a shop - hence the cupboards either side of the fireplace. This is the classic room in the pub with two-thirds height panelling. As you enter the pub from the front door, you encounter a highly distinctive display of woodwork - old lapped boarding on the right and further back a set of cupboards; the panelling on the left, however, is not so old, having taken its present form about 1980 (which\u00a0is also the date of the panelling in the games room) and it was all added by local carpenter, Richard Beasley.\n\r\nThe uneven red-tiled corridor leads to the rear part where, on the right, a small snug has been brought into use in modern times. It has a red-tile floor, panelled walls, bench seating and an early 20th-century fireplace. Changes were made just outside this room in 1977 when the sink used for cleaning glasses was removed. Further alterations\u00a0in the 1990s to bring the toilets inside also created a public drinking area in front of the entrance to the cellar servery. This has greatly expanded the size of the pub but has not destroyed the atmosphere of the old front rooms. At the rear left is a dining room that came\u00a0into use in the 1990s.",

        "Pub Name": "Painters Arms",
        "Address": "79 High Town Road, Luton, LU2 0BW",
        "Description": "The Painters was rebuilt in 1913 and occupies a corner site at the junction of Hightown and Havelock Roads. The ground floor is faced with deep green glazed bricks and the upper floor is of red brick. What makes the pub special is the survival of much of its original plan and the array of internal tiling. It was acquired by Benskins Watford Brewery Limited in 1921 and in the 1990s this was branded a \u2018Benskins Heritage Inn\u2019. \r\n\r\nOn Hightown Road side the central entrance leads to a lobby with colourful patterned tile floor. There are three doors each with decorative etched panels in the top of the doors \u2013 \u2018Public Bar\u2019 in the one on the right, \u2018Jug Bar\u2019 in the centre one, and \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 in the top of the left hand one. \r\n\r\nThe door with 'Jug Bar' means that it was originally for off-sales and now leads to a small snug. It is created by two three-quarter-height partition walls with Art Nouveau-style glazing along the top dividing it off from the larger bars left and right. It retains the original bar counter and did have seats (removed in the last few years) that ran down the sides of this intimate space where customers sat to partake a swift one before returning home. \r\n\r\nThe door on the right of the entrance lobby leads to the Public Bar with a curved panelled bar counter painted black and original bar back with plain columns and small decorative capitals at the top (one replaced by plain wood). It retains the original fixed seating with a bare timber back, some dado panelling at the rear and a vestibule entrance from Havelock Road. \r\n\r\nIn the rear left is a glazed brown brick fireplace and on either side of the fire are tiles to half height, some decorative, in shades of brown topped off with a frieze above in brown and green with fern and scallop shell ornament. Note the intertwined letters 'P A' (= Painters Arms) in the central panel between 'Public' and 'Bar' on the window in the public bar. This and the other rooms have a deep cornice painted dark brown. \r\n\r\nThe now disused entrance porch on the left in Hightown Road has a lobby with a colourful patterned tile floor and more of the tiling to half-height in shades of brown topped off with a frieze above in brown and green with fern and scallop shell ornament. A door with a \u2018Saloon\u2019 etched panel in the top leads into a short passage with more of the tiled dado and two doors \u2013 the one ahead has \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 in the top and the one to the right has \u2018Private Bar\u2019  - the doors look to have been switched as the door from the central lobby has a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 panel. \r\n\r\nThe front left Saloon Bar retains the original bar counter which carries a superstructure on twinned columns and with a pot shelf; above this are glazed lunettes which have an Art Nouveau-style glazing almost identical to those in the top of the screenwork around the Jug Bar. The original bar back remains and on the left wall is more of the colourful tiled dado, a tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace, and fixed seating. \r\n\r\nA widish gap leads to the rear room, the former \u2018Private Bar\u2019 i.e. the two rooms were combined some time ago. This room has another original panelled bar counter and bar back, also more of the pot shelf as appears in the front room. The attractive tiling continues on the dados of the walls on the left and there is a cast-iron fireplace that includes two pictorial green tiled panels. There is some tiled dado in the servery, dado panelling on rear wall, and also a pool table. \r\n\r\nA wall at the rear was taken out in 2000 and the door from the public bar widened so it is now possible to walk all the way around the pub. This small area at the rear has some old dado panelling and service here is from a hatch / doorway with shelf to the back of the servery. The pub was listed in 1998 following joint fieldwork by CAMRA and English Heritage.",

        "Pub Name": "Swan",
        "Address": "High Street, West Wycombe, HP14 3AE",
        "Description": "Now owned by the National Trust, like much of West Wycombe, this 18th-century pub was refitted and extended in 1932 in a simple style by Wheelers Wycombe brewery. Originally it consisted of two small rooms in what is now the lounge - hence two fireplaces - and it extended back as far as the bottle store/cellar; in the area of the present public bar was the former kitchen. To convert the original 18th-century front part into what we see today the brewery firstly constructed the large triple garage situated at the rear of the premises - this was then used as a temporary bar! The enlarged pub opened for business in 1932 and consists of two bars \u2013 the saloon and the public bar \u2013 set at right-angles to one another - with an off-sales and dining room behind. Prior to the extension a 99-year lease was granted in favour of Wheelers Brewery, who were then taken over by Simonds of Reading and eventually it became a Courage pub. In c.1970 the Barry family bought the lease from Courage so they are now direct tenants of the National Trust.\n\r\nSince 1910 the pub has been run by the same family and on 19 September 2010 a 100th birthday party was attended by 100 people. The front bar has an inglenook fireplace with decorative fire-back. The counter was installed in 1932 (possibly the first time the pub had a counter?) as was a modest back fitting with bevelled mirror panels situated at right angles to the counter. The parquet floor and brick fireplace on the left are from 1932. The only way to walk between the two bars without going outside is via the gents' toilets. These are unchanged with white tiled walls, two original Shanks' urinals and washbasin. The ladies' is situated just 'outside' the public bar entrance and is also unchanged and still has a 'one penny in the slot' device!\n\r\nThe public bar is accessed on the left and is somewhat austere with parquet floor, a fine bar-back with bevelled mirrored panels, a long counter with no dispensers, a 1930s brick fireplace with old coal stove and even a piano. Local real ale is served from casks stillaged behind the servery, something that is now quite rare in Britain (and non-existent in some parts). Note the curtains in the servery which can be pulled across to provide a degree of privacy between the two bars.\n\r\nAnother door down the left side has 'Reception' on the door and is the former jug and bottle,\u00a0The short passage has a parquet floor, two stools, a hatch/flap at the end and an old grandfather clock on the bar side.\n\r\nThe other door into the pub is to the Dining Room which is another small room with a parquet floor and 1930s brick fireplace. Keeps traditional hours i.e. open lunchtimes 12 to 2 and evenings from 5.30pm (7 Sun).",

        "Pub Name": "Hand & Heart",
        "Address": "12 Highbury Street, Peterborough, PE1 3BE",
        "Description": "Situated in a small terrace, the Hand & Heart is a small, purpose-rebuilt public house dating from 1938. Of two storeys in plain brick, with a flat roof, it was built for Warwick & Richardson\u2019s Brewery of Newark and is essentially intact and unaltered.\n\r\nSadly the two original front windows advertising 'Warwick's' have been replaced with similar, but not exact, copies in recent years. The front door on the left leads to a small lobby and, beyond an internal door in a full-height glazed screen, is the modest drinking lobby around the Jug Bar (off sales), both areas with black and white tiled flooring. A couple of bar stools confirms that this increasingly rare facility is in use here at times and the bell push to attract attention remains on the left. The screen in the drinking lobby can still be raised and lowered for service and the lower central panel is hinged and was used for transactions when this doubled as the off-sales, but is now permanently sealed, apparently at the insistence of 'Health & Safety'!. Note the number '2', a former requirement of the licensing magistrates, on the screen in the drinking lobby.\n\r\nA door on the right just short of the serving hatch leads to the public bar where the fabric and fittings from the Thirties scheme have survived very well. The bar counter has a distinctive Art Deco frontage; to the left there is a door to the servery for staff which has a hatch and shelf for service; and the mirrored bar back has succumbed to only modest changes to allow the inclusion of a fridge. Also preserved is the original fitted seating. The only lost item\u00a0is the fireplace,\u00a0replaced by a brick one from the 1960/70s. Note the WWII memorial on the wall of the public bar \u2013 there are only 60 or so of these in pubs in the whole of the UK.\n\r\nA door at the rear right corner of the drinking lobby, still with 'Smoke Room' and '3' painted on it, leads to a\u00a0compact room which\u00a0retains its full set of original fitted seating and a baffle by the door. Service to this room is via a hatch, which until the late 1990s had a door that\u00a0could be opened and closed for service. The only other lost item\u00a0is the original fireplace which has been replaced by one in an\u00a0inappropriate Victorian style.\u00a0Other doors in the drinking lobby lead to an 'inside' ladies toilet still with 'Ladies' painted on it, and to a passageway to the 'outside' gents (the exterior passageway to the gents' is now covered over). The passageway to the gents' has its own street entrance on the far left of the building.",

        "Pub Name": "Travellers Rest",
        "Address": "Chester Road, Alpraham, CW6 9JA",
        "Description": "A wayside, brick-built pub on the busy A51, Nantwich to Chester road. The original part consists of a T-plan building of c.1850 with Tudor-style windows. This has been extended, notably to the rear, in 1937. The pub retains four rooms and has been in the hands of the same family since 1900. The last changes were in c.1970 when the fourth room was brought into use as a public room. The fittings are plain and date from shortly before the Second World War. In the centre of the pub is a small public bar with a counter which extends into the lounge at the rear. Fronting the main road are the tap room (right) and darts room (left). \r\n\r\nThe corner door leads to the tap room which was probably the main drinking room in the past even though it has no counter as beer would have been served straight from the cask prior to 1937. It has a genuine Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood-surround fireplace and a 1930s Ind Coope  & Allsopp mirror. A doorway leads to the very small public bar - the room most in use these days. It has a counter, back-fitting and other furniture were probably installed in 1937. The cast-iron fireplace and beauty board panelling around date from c.1970. \r\n\r\nThe lounge bar is situated in the extension and has fittings of 1937. The counter front has wallpaper added to its frontage and one wall has more beauty board from c.1970. The room has its own entrance and is usually closed, but if you want to take a look just ask. It is used by Bowling Club members - between the pub and the fields to the rear is a bowling green in regular use. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a wooden building, originally a WW1 army hut and in use as a tea room between the late 1940s to 1989. It is still used occasionally for darts competitions and as a small function room. Both sets of toilets are outside - take a peek into the gents' which in summer is home to a family of swallows, who first arrived in 2003. \r\n\r\nJust beyond the domestic entrance is the Wicker Room/Darts Room on the front left of the pub, brought into use in c.1970. It was decided the tap room was too busy for darts games so a little-used domestic room brought into use. It has a glazed brick, cast-iron and wood-surround fireplace and beauty board on the walls. Look for the half door which creates a serving hatch to the back of the public bar but also is the door at the top of the cellar steps. \r\n\r\nThere is no electronic gadgetry here - the till is a drawer in the bar counter and there is no TV, piped music or fruit machines - so in the event of a power cut it can continue to fully operate with candles! If you visit on the Sunday lunchtime before Christmas Eve expect to see people coming from miles around wearing a topical or themed hat. Back in 1990 a chap came in wearing a bowler hat and ever since this has become 'Hat Sunday' and carols are sung. Closed Mon to Fri lunchtimes.",

        "Pub Name": "White Lion",
        "Address": "Audley Road, Barthomley, CW2 5PG",
        "Description": "A splendid half-timbered building dating from 1614 with three rooms and a section of wattle-and-daub on show. The original pub room is the small beamed tap room accessed via the right hand latch door, which has a figure '1' on it - a requirement of the licensing magistrates. This unspoilt room with a solid red-brown floor has fixed bare benches on the front wall side; an assortment of tables including a couple of scrubbed ones; and some chunky 'publican's rustic' stools. Situated near the settle is an oval-shaped table created from a piece of oak with a brass edging which has been here for years. A similar table in the corner of the room is a copy made by a customer a few years ago.  \r\n\r\nThe room has half-height old panelling and a fitted settle which is old as is indicated by the well worn seat. However, the high back of the settle is unusual - most similar settles have panels but this one features old fielded panels - which look like they are re-used wall panels but the date of the change is unknown. There is a 1930s-style brick fireplace with a coal fire but this may date from 1953 when there were changes in the left hand room. \r\n\r\nNote the glass covered section of wattle-and-daub on the left hand wall and a mummified rat which came from the loft and discovered by builder when the pub was re-thatched in 1999. It has no bar counter - originally beer was served from a hatch situated in the doorway of what is now the third public room situated at the rear. There was actually a servery in the area where there is now a kitchen - the wall that separates the kitchen from the present third room is a recent addition. It is believed that the servery consisted of a bar back fitting where the ovens are now situated and also a counter/cabinet just about where the wall is situated. However, the third room was only ever a private room and not used by customers until 1994. Note the figure '5' on the door to the cellar. A passage on the rear right leads to a door and across the cobbled yard is the outside gents. \r\n\r\nThe beamed room on the left on a lower level and with a figure '2' on the door was for 200 years the twice-yearly Court Leet and Court Baron for the Manors of Crewe Green, Barthomley and Leighton; and has been used as a school room in the past. It only became a pub room in 1953 which is the date of the bar counter and bar back fitting. There are two upright columns featured in the bar counter which originally went right up to the ceiling beams until the 1990s when a former licensee cut the top sections off and added the copper caps. It has an old red tiled floor and some new tiles; old half-height panelling; and a brick fireplace which looks 1930s in style but was probably added in 1953. \r\n\r\nThe tiny room at the rear of the pub was converted from private quarters in 1994 and has a flag-like tiled floor, a tiled fireplace with stove and is served from a doorway/hatch to the side of the bar. Upstairs there is a small function/meeting room where the ceiling was removed in the 1990s so it is now open the the rafters and it has a small Victorian cast-iron fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe pub closed on 1st April 2013 following the thatched roof catching fire. Following repairs it was reopened on 23rd July 2013. The roof has been re-thatched and the three rooms downstairs have been cleaned [and re-painted where appropriate] to remove the effects of smoke damage. Exterior brickwork on chimney etc has been re-pointed.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2016.\n\nThe pub reopened in April 2016 after a significant refurbishment that has seen major changes to the historic layout and fittings, leading to re-categorisation as Interior Ruined. \n\nThe former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nRebuilt around 1935 in 'brewers' Tudor' style with half-timbering on the upper storey and brick and stone to the ground floor. It is little changed from the original plan \u2013 Tap Room on the left, Snug on the right and, behind this, the Smoke Room with a lobby bar. The servery has three intact usable rising bar counter screens and the original bar-back incorporates two tall thin display cases with leaded glazed window. The upper door of the staff entrance and the counter flap have been removed in recent years. The Smoke Room at the rear right is completely wood-panelled with original fixed seating re-upholstered, bell-pushes, and a glazed brick and stone fireplace with wood surround. Look for the rose symbols carved into the fielded panelling here and elsewhere throughout the pub. \n\nThe Smoke Room was originally separated from the lobby area by a wall running most of the way between the ends of the fixed seating i.e. parallel to the servery. Then in 1963 the wall was removed and an extra section of fixed seating added on the staircase side. The draught screen by the rear door was moved here from the Tap Room in 1963 after the wall was removed. The seating originally only came two-thirds along the wall as the entrance to the room was near the staircase \u2013 take a look and you will see the final one third section of seating is set forward from the rest. It was also moved here from the Tap Room. \n\nOn the front left is the Tap Room which retains original fixed seating with a draught screen by the door and has a lovely glazed brick and wood surround fireplace. Originally it was served by a hatch and in 1963 was changed to the present bar - take a look at the dado panelling and you see two styles of wood. The fixed seating that ran under the hatch together with the draught screen at the end was moved to the Smoke Room. The front right Snug has mock Tudor panels on the walls, a 1930s brick and Tudor-style stone and rough-hewn wood surround fireplace but never had any fixed seating. \n\nThe fielded panelled walls continue through the lobby to the ladies toilet, which has an ante room with a dado of 1930s tiles (modern tiles in ladies\u2019 itself) and original tiled floor throughout. The panelling continues up the staircase to the Club Room on the first floor, which is now a pool room. The bell indicator box with 'Smoke Rm'; 'Snug'; 'Tap Rm'; and 'Club Rm' windows is situated within the servery but no longer works. The rear porch has a tiled floor incorporating the signs of the zodiac. The outside gents' (modernised) remain but now have a covered walkway to them. \n\nListed at Grade II in April 2014 following a successful application by CAMRA.",

        "Pub Name": "Harrington Arms",
        "Address": "Church Lane, Gawsworth, SK11 9RJ",
        "Description": "The Harrington Arms is a rural public house attached to a working farm (75 acres) and until 2007 both the pub and the farm were run by the same person - a rare example of a once common way of making a livelihood - combining public house keeping with other activities. \r\n\r\nThis red brick pub was built in two phases with the oldest three storey part dating back to the seventeenth century. The Bayley family ran the pub for over 100 years until 2007 with Marjorie having been at the pub from 1942 until her death in 1998 aged 86 - hence the little changed interior which has been used by TV companies. Both the pub and the farm are owned by Robinsons brewery having bought them from the Bayley family in the 1930s when they wanted to buy a hotel in Blackpool! \r\n\r\nIn the past it was probably operating with just a small servery where beer was served from the cask into a jug and the main drinking room being the splendid Tap Room on the front left. More rooms were brought into use over the years - the former kitchen/living room being the last one in 2007 making five rooms in all. In recent years the pub has started to sell meals but it is still very much a pub that welcomes drinkers.\r\n\r\nThrough the ancient inner door with a row of glazing protectors and to the right is a narrow room with the bar. The servery in its present form dates from 1984; prior to that arrangements were simpler with the casks stillaged against the back wall and no bar counter - just a screen with a ledge. In one room there is a photo of long serving landlady Marjorie Bayley serving beer from casks into jugs and it shows some old bar back shelves. In 1984 Robinsons added the bar fittings and replaced the screen around the servery with a virtual copy. This is confirmed by a 1980 drawing of the servery situated just above the door. Note the old till dating from the early early 1900s and the figure '2' on the door to the cellar - a requirement of the licensing magistrates. \r\n\r\nThe original drinking room is the timeless tap room on the front left and is one of the country's finest unspoilt pub rooms. It has a latch door with the figure '5' on it, a red and black quarry tiled floor interestingly laid both square and diagonally, very old wall benches on two sides - one with a noticeable slope - a fitted high backed settle and a small piece of window bench seating. The brick fireplace (at least 70 years old) has a log burner and old oblong scrubbed tables and basic low benches all add to this atmospheric room. \r\n\r\nThe diamond laid red and black quarry-tiled hall leads to a former external door as the toilets are situated in a brick extension to the original building, no doubt added to bring the toilets inside, and also add a kitchen. In 2007 the former kitchen/living room on the rear left was brought into use as a public room. It has a figure '6' on the latch door, a splendid large early 20th century range of enamelled iron with no less than 8 ovens and an open fire as well as old wall cabinets. This small room has a black and red quarry tiled floor in the same design as the front left room, two antique settles and an oblong scrubbed tables making this another room with a timeless feel. Note the old hooks in the ceiling from which meats would have been hung in the past. The draught screen by an exterior door is modern. \r\n\r\nThere are two more small rooms on the right hand side of the pub. A very small bare wood floored Snug with the figure '3' on the door has a hatch for service to the side of the servery which was added in the 1984, a 1950s brick fireplace with a log fire and a domestic looking wall cupboard. \r\n\r\nTo the rear right up a few steps is another room which as its name 'the Parlour' implies it was previously private quarters until the 1950s. It has the figure '4' on the door, an antique settle and another 1950s brick fireplace. A Conker Championship is held every early October.",

        "Pub Name": "Castle",
        "Address": "25-27 Church Street, Macclesfield, SK11 6LB",
        "Description": "Whitened brick, 18th century pub tucked away on a cobbled street. It probably started life originally as late 18th century dwellings which were remodelled later as a pub in the 19th century and was owned by Macclesfield's Lonsdale & Adshead Brewery. Large 19th century extension at rear. The interior of four small rooms off a central corridor is little altered no doubt partly due to a long serving licensee Charles Lomas (1930 to 1962). From the central entrance a door in the inner lobby on the front right leads to the tiny tap room with a late 19th century bar counter with decorative brackets, old half-height tongue-and-groove panelling with wall benches attached, and a small Victorian cast-iron fireplace was originally in the kitchen, that has a mirror in the old mantelpiece above; the bar back shelving are mostly modern.. Note the holes in the bar counter in the public bar near the fireplace \u2013 in the 1930s crates of Guinness were brought from the cellar and placed behind the counter and the holes were to help to bring it up to room temperature. \r\n\r\nThe inner latch door with glazing protectors leads to the lobby and passageway to the rear. On the right of the corridor is a splendid curved shop front-like glazed screenwork with rising sash windows, formerly the off-sales, now permanently closed, where cigarettes and spirits were stored and sold from. Alongside is a stable door entrance to the servery for staff with a ledge and upper window that can be closed. Also in this area is a display case holding a collection of miniatures and old bottles. Take a look within the servery and you will see an indicator box for the bell-pushes with four windows 'Front Door' (unusual), 'Parlour', 'Smoke Room', and 'Kitchen' which last worked in the 1960s. \r\n\r\nOn the left are narrow double doors leading to the splendid small smoke room which has an ornamented, probably 1920s, ceiling of moulded putty featuring a pair of lozenge patterns with foliage ornament. Deteriorating in recent years, the ceiling was superbly restored back to its original condition prior to the pub reopening in 2021 after a six year closure. All around the room is high-backed fixed seating with delicate legs and arms and bell pushes in the top and is said to have been installed in 1910. This room also has a good painted slate Victorian fireplace incorporating two pictorial tiled panels of monks eating and drinking. \r\n\r\nOn the right is the parlour situated behind the servery with a glazed partition to corridor side and has a doorway and plain baffle. It retains the original bench seating on the left hand side with bell pushes above. The bar counter was added in 1971 and some fixed seating in this area was removed. The passageway has a dado of varnished Lincrusta and at the end of past an open staircase is the rear room brought into pub use in 1986. It has no old fittings and part of the wall between it and the parlour has been removed 'for supervision'. Then in 2021 the rear room was doubled by amalgamation with the kitchen on the rear left. A passage on the left leads to the original gents' brought inside in modern times.",

        "Pub Name": "Seven Stars",
        "Address": "The Moor, Falmouth, TR11 3QA",
        "Description": "Prominently sited in front of a small square in the centre of town, the Seven Stars is an urban classic. The original Victorian building (1868?) was extended to the right in 1912 and an off-sales shop added. Closed during the war it was not re-opened until the late 1980s but as this didn't work out and when the local tobacconist retired, the business was transferred to the Seven Stars shop and continued until 2006. The pub has been in the same family since 1868 and, as well as being a local Anglican clergyman, Rev. Barrington Bennetts was behind the bar for over 50 years until his death in 2011. A notable feature of the exterior was the sign board high up at roof level - which fell down during a storm and is still to be replaced. Such boards commonly feature in old pictures of pubs but they have now all but disappeared. \r\n\r\nThe completely unspoilt public bar at the front has a late Victorian counter, shelves and a wooden stillage from around 1898. The beer is served from casks behind the bar the metal stillages were introduced in 1947 and 1949. The white marble counter on the right dates from the days when there was a separate oyster bar - see the brown paper bag in a frame on the wall on the left. Sadly, the glass snack counter on stilts introduced by Meredith & Drew in the mid-1950s has recently been removed but there are still-working gas lights at each end of the bar. The tiled fireplace dates from 1912 and seating mainly consists of benches attached to the panelled walls. Among the drinks on sale is 'Grandma's Weapons Grade Ginger Beer' but this is an alcoholic version at 5.5% ABV!\r\n\r\nFrom the front door a passage leads to the rear and has an inner door with 'Saloon Bar' and seven blue coloured stars on it which was originally positioned on the front of the pub when the main bar was subdivided by a partition. Beyond the off-sales hatch with its sliding windows and red Formica shelf is the rear smoke room. This also has a 1912 tiled fireplace, two large plain mirrors of some antiquity, a hatch/doorway to the back of the bar, skylight and 1960s seating. Look for the \"coffin hatch\" in the ceiling. The former gents' outside WC is now the ladies' while the gents' facilities are inside. Former landlord the Rev. Bennetts was only the second real person to appear in The Beano comic (No 3151 for 7 Dec 2002 - \"Crazy for Daisy\") where the Seven Stars was called \"The Reverend's Pop Shop\" with a story all about him selling 'pop to the whole of Beanoland' for 50 years! A cartoonist for the comic drinks here - the only other real person named in The Beano is David Beckham!",

        "Address": "Broughton Mills, Broughton Mills, LA20 6AX",
        "Description": "Rough cast stone building in small hamlet. Datestone 1748 over the door, but with later extensions: it was part of a working farm until 1988. Originally two public rooms, two further rooms (the former village shop at the rear and one on the far left once part of the private accommodation) have been brought into use in recent years and have no old fittings. Entry is via a passageway with uneven flagstone floor, which runs through the building giving access to the rear rooms and gents\u2019 toilet. A branch to the left gives access to the kitchen (in a modern extension) and the ladies\u2019 toilets. The small bar on the right never had a proper bar counter until 1996 when a plain, simple one was installed along with new shelving behind, and there is a small fireplace with a modern overmantel. Although this is a small room, there are two doors (one of which has a figure '1' on it and one is locked out of use) giving access to the passageway. \r\n\r\nThe reason for inclusion as a pub with a nationally important pub interior is the room to the left It is divided from the passageway by a solid wooden screen with benches attached and is unaltered for many years. The tongue and groove latch door has a figure '2' being a requirement of the licensing magistrates in the past. It contains a cast-iron range and a couple of fitted cupboards of the former kitchen showing how the public house expanded into the private one. Seating consists of bare benches attached to the passageway partition, bare window seating, and a small piece of of wall bench seating left of the range fireplace. Its rear wall contains a door (locked and out of use) and a window looking onto the passageway to the kitchen. The low ancient beamed ceiling and three scrubbed top tables adds to the timeless nature of this room. \r\n\r\nThe building is floored with stone flags throughout, there are working gas lights in some of the rooms, and a mounting block in front of the building. Furniture is simple, and overall it gives a good impression of an old country inn. The extension into the shop and private accommodation does not detract \u2013 no recent changes appear to have been made to the plan of the building. However, the two doors into the bar room from the passageway suggest that there may have been some changes in this room in the past.\r\n\r\n2014 Information received from a local lady whose family had run the pub for 80 years that the left-hand room was in use as part of the pub before the Second World War.",

        "Address": "22 Botchergate, Carlisle, CA1 1QS",
        "Description": "Built 1929-30 to designs by Harry Redfern, this is the least altered of the Carlisle & District State Management Scheme pubs (i.e. the state control system set up in the First World War to run Carlisle's brewing and distribution system). It has an elegant Tudor Gothic style stone frontage with a first floor oriel window - just the sort of civilised architecture intended to mirror civilised drinking which was one of the aims of the Scheme. From the left hand door there is a long panelled passage that leads to the main bar. The right hand panelled partition has at times in the past been partly removed for access into the front right room but is now firmly fixed in place. Between the main bar and the front room there is a wide opening following removal of double doors. The small front room retains its rectangular fielded panelling to two-thirds height and in it is a \u2018Ladies Powder Room\u2019 door leading to the toilet. Modern bar counter has replaced the original hatch. The bar counter and bar back in the main bar look modern (listed description says counter brought forward and\r\nextended to the rear) but the panelling and the fireplace are original. Recently a small dance floor and DJ booth have been added. At the rear is another separate room with an original 1930s stone fireplace. Recently a new glazed partition has been added to split the room into two with seating in the front section and a pool area at the rear. \r\n\r\nA visit upstairs is recommended where the two little used upstairs bars have recently been converted into \u2018Outpost Restaurant & Bar\u2019 - a separate business accessed via a staircase from the right front door. Both bars have original counters (tops have been replaced), bar back shelving, three stone fireplaces of superior quality to the downstairs examples (two have the date 1930 on them) with the front right one having a recently exposed terrazzo floor in front of it (the tiles are new). On the panelled walls there are several gilded inscriptions from Omar Khayyam, Robert Burns and G.K Chesterton all in praise of civilised drinking. Above the panelling are painted cartouches with vine motifs and, over the fireplaces, jugs and glasses. The restaurant is open Tue to Sun (and Bank Holiday Mon) from 5 to 10 (10.30 Fri, Sat); also Thu, Fri and Sat 12 to 2. Restaurant phone number is 01228 818448.",

        "Pub Name": "Olde Dolphin Inne",
        "Address": "5a Queen Street, Derby, Cathedral Quarter, DE1 3DL",
        "Description": "Derby's oldest pub with the licence said to date from 1580.  This four room pub is a remarkable survivor considering its city-centre location. It is a late 16th-century building but most of what we see today is the result of an inter-war restoration, which created much of the internal arrangements and character of the pub. Externally the upper floor is half-timbered though a close inspection will show that the timbers date from the inter-war remodelling - the original timbers failed when the external rendering was removed. The entrance leads to a corridor passing through the building: it used to lead to some cottages but these have been demolished and a drinking patio has been created. A staircase on the right leads to '1530 AD Steak Bar' (the pub claims to date from 1530) - an upstairs restaurant open Thu, Fri, Sat from 6.30pm. This room has massive 16th-century timbers and an old brick fireplace with a brass hood. \r\n\r\nThe four bars are to the left of the passage and are grouped around a central servery. The lovely small snug (rear right) has a part-glazed partition wall around the servery, full-height fielded wood panelling with a painted grain effect, and inter-war fixed seating and leaded windows; the fireplace is possibly tiled but painted black: service is from a hatch/door. The lounge (rear left) has more interwar furnishings including a large inglenook fireplace. The front right bar has a red quarry-tiled floor, dado panelling with benches attached, a brick and wood surround fireplace with a log fire: the bar-back fitting is inter-war but the counter was replaced in the 1980s. On a slightly higher level is Offilers Lounge, named after the local brewery which was closed  by (Bass) Charrington in 1966, and so called because contained Offilers' breweriana (since removed). There are a number of bell-pushes in the panel above the fixed seating but the fireplace is modern. Ghost walks start from here on the first or second Monday of each month and include a meal in the '1530 AD' restaurant.",

        "Pub Name": "Duke of York",
        "Address": "Main St, Elton, DE4 2BW",
        "Description": "This delightfully unchanged village pub is well worth seeking out despite the limited opening hours. The plain, symmetrical, three-bay frontage of this 200-year-old pub conceals a three-room pub which has been in the same family since 1968. It was bought from the Derby brewers, Offilers, by Bill Elliott, and is still run by his\u00a0nephew (his widow, long-serving licensee Mary, sadly died in 2022). A central tiled corridor leads down to the heart of the pub \u2013 the rear main bar entered via a latch door in a partition wall, which has a \u20183\u2019 on it and short vertical, draught screens / baffles either side of the door on the inside \u2013 very rare in a pub these days. This small room has a red quarry-tiled floor, fixed bench seating and\u00a0wood-panelled ceiling, The\u00a0open coal fire has recently been replaced with a glass-fronted multi-fuel stove but is still\u00a0set in an old stone surround of the kind typical of houses in this area.\n\r\nUntil about 1985 the counter did not extend as far as the window then the three right-hand panels of the counter and of the glazed screen above which were originally at right angles to the rest of the counter / screen were extended with great care so that one needs to look carefully to realise that they have been re-positioned. They were straightened out to give more room for staff and the storage of bottles, crisps and a small fridge. Up to around 1985 where the present sink is situated there was a table and four chairs. The screen had vertical glazed sashes (see the traces of the runners etc on the left-hand side). Note the old photo on the wall which shows that the basic old bar back shelving was originally to the left of where it is now and after it moved to the right in c.1985 a hatch was cut for service to the room behind.\n\r\nLeft of the corridor is a plain snug with a Victorian tiled fireplace and a modern hatch to the servery. On the right is room with a no. 2 on the door which retains its Victorian fixed bench seating, but the Victorian-style fireplace was installed in about 2000. Note the old panelling at the end of the corridor. Service to both of these two rooms is via the window in the split door to the servery just short of the door to the main bar. Note the \u2018C\u2019 on the door to the cellar opposite. A set of three well-worn steps on the rear right leads to an external door and what is now a flagged coutyard seating area; until recently the outside toilets occupied this space but the loos are now indoors.\u00a0Upstairs is a large club room which can be divided into two parts by a sliding partition and was used by the local branch of the Oddfellows Society. Only open Tuesdays to Sundays from 8.30pm to 10.30pm.",

        "Pub Name": "Barley Mow Inn",
        "Address": "Main Street, Kirk Ireton, DE6 3JP",
        "Description": "An excellent unspoilt pub. A three-storey, stone building, listed at grade II* and dating from the seventeenth-century with mullioned windows and a heavy raised door surround to the main entrance. It proudly displays two gables to the street and has a sun-dial under the eaves in the centre bearing the date 1683. It became an inn some 200 years ago and the layout has remained undisturbed partly because the previous landlady Mrs Ford spent all of her 89 years here and refused all things modern such as VAT and \u2018going decimal\u2019. When she died in 1976 her relatives firstly sold the contents \u2013 fixed seating in the public bar remained - and then put the pub on the market. Present landlady Mary Short bought it with the intention of retaining its unspoilt qualities so she purchased traditional furnishings to match the interior with a result that the pub looks like it hasn\u2019t changed in over a 100 years. \r\n\r\nThe small low beamed public bar has a wonderful, unspoilt atmosphere with bench seating round the walls - some old, some added in 1976 - , slate-topped tables (from a three quarter sized billiard table \u2013 hence the holes in the corners!), quarry tile flooring and a huge fireplace with log fire. Service is via a small counter which is more like a hatch \u2013 the shutter which could be post-war is held open by bolts and is still occasionally used to close the bar! Most of the shelves in the servery are old but the bar top is modern. \r\n\r\nCasks of beer are lined up on a stillage behind the bar and served straight into the glass. One beer, usually Hartington IPA from Whim Brewery, is kept in the cellar and is served via a jug. Other Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Star, Bath, Somerset; Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire; Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, West Wales; Falcon, Arncliffe, North Yorkshire; and Cresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales. \r\n\r\nThrough a pair of narrow doors is a passage, which lead to the toilets brought inside in c.1980. Off to the right is the small \u2018Parlour\u2019 which although historically could have been used as a public room it was not until 1976 it was brought into regular use. It has a polished oak parquet floor, cast fireplace in a 19th century wooden surround and wall cabinet. The corner pews and antique settle are items brought in by Mary Short. The exterior \u2018half\u2019 doors and the original path into the building are no longer in use. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the servery is a stable door with glazed half doors through which you are served and up the short flight of stairs is the former kitchen which is brought into use only when the pub is busy. It has a quarry tiled floor with, unusually, stripes of black and red tiles running diagonally across the room. The original Georgian fireplace remains and again traditional furnishings are items added in 1976. Beyond that there is a further quarry tiled room only used by residents for meals. On the left of the driveway is Kirk Ireton Village Shop created from an outbuilding of the pub. It is run by the community and no rent is charged by the pub. All the profits are re-invested in shop improvements.",

        "Description": "A marvellous, rural country pub, sited to serve a road junction and which used to double as a farm. The oldest buildings date from the seventeenth- or eighteenth-century and the higher, right-hand part was added in the nineteenth. The entrance lobby has a door with a figure \u20182\u2019 on it in front of you which leads to the basic main bar with its stone-flagged floor (returned by the licensees as a result of removing a red screeded one) and huge stone fire-surround with the massive stone mantelshelf almost reaching the ceiling and a range fire. There was no counter until the present one was installed in the 1940s (the bar front dates from the 1980s) and the bar back is a number of brown painted shelves on a mirrored backing. The music room on the right has only been brought into use quite recently and the way the work has been done is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the old pub. It has a panelled dado with bare benches attached, a stone surround bucket-style fireplace and a modern hatch to the bar. \r\n\r\nThe door on the left of the lobby with a figure \u20183\u2019 on it was the original second public room. Nowadays it is normally closed but can be pressed into service if the pub is busy or for a group. It also has a flagstone floor, another old fireplace with a stone surround, a basic bench and a display of pottery. The pub has only limited opening hours as owners Geoff and Pat Fuller are potters \u2013 a lot of their work is on show in the pub and may be purchased. The pottery is situated in the old range further to the left which was in the past used for animals. The pub sells beers from Abbeydale Brewery including one called \u2018Lurcher\u2019 at 8% only brewed for this pub.",

        "Pub Name": "Drewe Arms",
        "Address": "The Square, Drewsteignton, EX6 6QN",
        "Description": "One of the UK's classic village pub with no counter and four rooms. Occupying much of the north side of Drewsteighton's attractive square, the Drewe Arms contributes to a picture postcard village scene. It has evolved out of a series of cottages and some of the thick inner walls and the changes in levels show how this has taken place. The historic pub core really consists of one room (on the left) with the servery behind a panelled partition; service is through a stable door arrangement. Fixed seats follow the walls round. Hatch from the servery to the corridor. The servery itself is very different to what was it was up to the early 1990s - the stillage is now at the end of the room but was originally on the left, a lot of the shelving is modern, and originally customers were allowed to sit in the servery by invitation of the licensee. \r\n\r\nBy walking through the servery and turning right you find a room that was in domestic use in the past and brought into use as an overspill room. Currently it is only used for private functions but at quiet times it is possible to ask staff if you want to visit it. On the right of the entrance is another historic room but for much of its existence this served as a dining room for those staying in the guest rooms. It may seem odd that there are two doorways into it. The reason for this is said to be the fact that the entrance nearer the outer door of the pub led to awful chilly drafts in winter and so it was boarded up and the inner doorway created. It has a fixed bench under the window and a fireplace with a granite surround and positively gargantuan lintel over. \r\n\r\nThe Drewe Arms is a legend in the annals of historic rural pubs. For 75 years it was kept by Mabel Mudge who retired in October 1994, aged 99 and who thus was England's oldest licensee. She had married Ernest Mudge in 1916 and the couple ran the Royal Hotel in nearby Crockernwell for a couple of years. They then moved to our pub - then known as the Druid Arms - which had been taken over by Ern's brother Alfred in about 1893. The way the pub was run was typical of thousands of such businesses in times past. The pub was only part of the business. Ern ran a carrier's business and drove a horse and cart to Exeter once or twice a week and elsewhere as custom required. He also rented a five-acre smallholding which provided corn and hay for the horses and milk for the village. Accommodation was offered to travellers and visitors (hence the dining room mentioned above). The name of the pub changed to the present one at the instigation of Julius Drewe, tea merchant and founder of the Home & Colonial grocery stores. It was he who commissioned the magnificent Castle Drogo nearby to designs by Edwin Lutyens and built between 1910 and 1930. \r\n\r\nAfter Mrs Mudge's retirement the villagers ran pub as a trust for nearly a year under an agreement with the owners, Whitbread. The former tenants, Janice and Colin Sparks came in 1996 and have turned the pub into a thriving business but wisely keeping the historic core which does so much to make it a special place. The flimsy 1950s boarding was stripped out of the right hand bar, the blocked entrance there was opened up, and the upstairs rooms modernised into comfortable bedrooms. If you walk through the servery and turn right you find a room that was in domestic use in the past and brought into use as an over-spill room. Currently it is only used for private functions but at quiet times it is possible to ask staff if you want to visit it. A new drinking/dining area has been created on the right-hand side of the pub in the area where Mabel Mudge had her kitchen. It was here she slept in later years when she was unable to climb the stairs; the room is now known as 'Aunt Mabel's Kitchen'. Mabel died, aged 101, two years after leaving the pub.",

        "Address": "Luppitt, EX14 4RT",
        "Description": "A rare example of a simple, unspoiled farmhouse pub of the type that was common years ago but now virtually extinct. It has been in the same family ownership for over 100 years and is still part of a working farm run by other members of the family so don't be surprised if you find chickens in the yard. Other Heritage Pubs with working farms attached and run by the licensee or their family members are the Quiet Woman, Earl Sterndale; Victoria Arms, Worton ; New Cross Inn, Court Henry ; and Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen . The building itself is a modest two-storey Victorian one, built of local stone (rendered at rear) with a slate roof. The entrance to the pub is in the yard and the pub part occupies two rooms on the north side with an entry between the two into a quarry-tiled hallway. \r\n\r\nThe room in regular use being that on the right containing the servery. It has a stable door and don't be surprised if a customer slides the bolt after you have entered to keep it closed! There is nothing sophisticated, only a simple match-boarded counter which could be 100 years old and with a door missing and the flap permanently opened, a few simple shelves and beer drawn direct from casks (nowadays more likely to be a poly barrel) stillaged behind the bar. The room is so small that you will find you are quickly brought into conversation with others or you may be encouraged to test your skill on the various puzzles strewn over the table. \r\n\r\nThe small room on the left has a (1930s ?) brick fireplace. What at first glance looks like a flagstone floor in both rooms is in fact army surplus rubber matting installed just after WWII that came from nearby USAF Dunkerswell laid on a concrete floor. The only food sold is crisps and nuts. Outside gents' and ladies' across the yard. At the time of writing, only open Thursday from 7.30pm to 9.30pm and Saturday from 7.30pm to 10.30pm, but this is subject to change so best to ring to check before travelling.",

        "Address": "Bridge Hill, Topsham, EX3 0QQ",
        "Description": "This famous pink-washed public house is one of the most unspoilt pubs in the country being scarcely changed in over 100 years. It has been in the same family since 1897 when it was bought by William John Gibbings. Since 1930 it has come down through the female line and it is presently held by Caroline Cheffers-Heard. The rendered and tile-hung building is probably of C18 origin (if not earlier) with lower, right-hand wing being late C18/early C19. At the back is a large wing, which used to serve as a brewery and malt-house in the 19th century (brewing ceased in the early 1900s). \r\n\r\nThere are two public rooms at the front while the former brewery/maltings is also used as occasion requires. Front right-hand room is known as the Tap Room and has some plain, old fixed seating attached to very old dado panelling, old wall cupboards and Victorian cast iron and wood surround fireplace. Over the doorway the attractions of Kennaway's Scotch whisky are advertised in old cemented-on white lettering! \r\n\r\nA panelled corridor leads on to the superb Snug, right in the heart of the pub. A large high settle with glazed panels over bulges out into the corridor and effectively forms one of the sides of this intimate room with a bare bench on the inside of it. There is a large stone fireplace, old salt store high up above it, some fixed bench seating attached to the very old dado panelling and a grandfather clock dating from 1726. One of the few changes to the interior of the pub has been the provision of a small counter more like a hatch with no handpumps or other dispensers. This was added just after WWII for ease of service from the parlour/servery to the snug. \r\n\r\nThe servery is known as the 'inner sanctum' and customers are allowed to sit there - but by invitation only. On the door to the Inner Sanctum is the sign \"Please remember this little parlour is not a public area and is regarded as our family sitting room\". This is one of three remaining examples of a room where customers can sit while staff are serving from the same area - the other two examples being the Select at the Arden Arms, Stockport, Greater Manchester; and the snug at Ye Horns Inn, Goosnagh, Lancashire. It has old window seating, a curved settle, small cast fireplace with log fire - and if you are privileged to be invited inside you will note the three different bottle openers on the wall with one for the old marble stopper bottles. Beer - up to ten real ales, mostly from Devon breweries - is fetched from the cellar - ask for the beer menu that is printed daily! Real ales can also be served in third of a pint glasses. To get served many customers stand at the door to the Inner Sanctum and then drink in the Tap Room opposite. \r\n\r\nThe malt-house room with its own entrance from the car park has a bar counter installed in the mid 1960s, a large 1930s brick fireplace and even one of the old hop shoots remains. Between the cellar and the malt-house there is a brick built furnace that provided hot air for hop-drying and malting operations. The malt-house room is only used for functions, meetings or as an overflow if the pub is busy. However, if, at a quiet time, you would like to take a look just ask bar staff and they will open it up for you. Being so traditional you will not be surprised to find the pub toilets are outside ladies' and gents'. In good weather they open a hatch / split door from the cellar for garden service. \r\n\r\nThe pub has the distinction of being the first to be visited by H.M. Queen Elizabeth II on an official visit on 27th March 1998  - look for the plaque on the wall and numerous photographs all around the pub. We don't know which of the excellent beers the Queen chose!; the pub does hold a letter from Prince Philip's equerry saying now much the Prince enjoyed his visit. Let us hope this will be the first of many such visits to one of Britain's Best Heritage Pubs! \r\n\r\nThe opening hours are still those imposed by the government under the 1914 Defence of the Realm Act which restricted them with a view to ensuring people made more ammunition instead of getting drunk! There is a sign on the door stating \"The (1914) hours are Lunchtimes 12 to 2; Evenings Monday to Thursday 6 to 10.30; Evenings Friday & Saturday 6 to 11; Sunday Evening 7 to 10.30.\"",

        "Pub Name": "Vine Inn",
        "Address": "Vine Hill, Pamphill, BH21 4EE",
        "Description": "A small, country pub owned by the National Trust which is hidden away just a mile west of Wimborne Minster. The original part of the building, built of red and black bricks, is early 19th-century and near the road; further away is a slightly later extension. It has been a bakehouse and stores in the past. Fitted out in 1900 by the current landlady's grandfather, who was the first licensee, it has remained in the same family since being a pub. Originally owned by Marstons of Poole and then Strongs of Romsey it was bought by the National Trust in 1989. \r\n\r\nNote how the inn sign is situated up the hill on the car park. Don't miss the magnificent vine creeping over the building. The falling site means you go downstairs to a tiny, basic public bar which has not been altered in nearly a century and at only 8 ft by 8 ft it is one of the smallest public bars in the country. It retains the original panelled counter - the bar top was replaced in the 1950s - and most of the original bar back shelves with some small glass pieces added to the wall behind in the 1960s. There is just one small table, a short bench attached to the wall between the door and the bar counter, and another bench attached to wall panelling from 1900. On the inside of the counter there is an old bottle opener, old drawer and cupboard below. \r\n\r\nFrom Vine Hill three stone steps lead to the Tap Room, which is also accessed from the tiny bar by a flight of 9 steps attached to a partition wall with full height panelled walls and ceiling. This very simple room retains its original tongue and groove dado painted pink, a tiled and wood surround fireplace possibly from the inter war period and space for just three small green Formica top tables. On the other side of the public bar a separate entrance leads into what was grandfather's sitting room - a very small room probably brought into use in the 1960s. It has an unusual bar counter of narrow ribbed panels from the 1960s that replaced a simple hatch/shelf across the doorway, wall cupboards from when it was a domestic room and a cast iron and wood surround fireplace that is not that old. The outside gents' with a glazed white brick urinal is situated on the front of the building; the outside ladies' appear to be a later addition and are also outside. Open lunchtimes and evenings, it closes at 10.30 Mon to Wed. Ploughman's lunches and sandwiches are available lunchtimes only - if you are sitting outside listen for a knock on the window to tell you the food is ready to collect from the bar!",

        "Pub Name": "Square & Compass",
        "Address": "Worth Matravers, BH19 3LF",
        "Description": "18th century pub built as two cottages it has been a pub since 1793. Run by the Newman family since 1907, this ancient Purbeck pub has just two rooms, flagstone floors, panelling, benches round the walls, serving hatches and splendid views of medieval field patterns and the sea beyond. An uneven flagstone passage runs from the front door and leads to a cellar servery situated in a lean-to added to the original building. Service is via the hatch/doorway into the servery (originally the back door) and a hatch further down the passageway on the left. The servery consists of a row of barrels on a stillage and numerous old shelves with no proper bar - one of only 20 such pubs left in the country. \r\n\r\nContinue along the passageway and on the left is the tap room created by partition walls and is a truly venerable one. This small room has a flagstone floor and the seating is solid bare wood benches attached to the walls. The large old brick fireplace has a mantelshelf almost touching the ceiling. Between the shelf and the ceiling are display cases with old bottles. The room has three old tables and some stools made from logs. The fireplace took its present style when the stone interior was removed in 1990 to open it up and a furnace replaced the old hearth. \r\n\r\nOn the right of the entrance passageway is what is called the 'Big Room', which was a small parlour prior to 1935 and service was via the hatch formed by two tiny doors hidden in the panelling in the first half of the room. In 1935 the parlour was expanded to the size of the room we see today by extending into the stable block as signified by the two different ceiling heights. The date is confirmed by a large photograph in the Big Room captioned 'Reconstruction by Hayter and Son, the builders of Swanage, November 1935'. The room has a figure '1' on the latch door, a wood-block floor, fielded panelling on the walls and a false beam all dating from 1935. There are loose benches and at the far end of the room a stone fireplace with a log fire and a couple of small window seats. There is a large hatch cut in 1978 in the far section of the room which is now permanently hidden (fortunately) behind curtains. \r\n\r\nLook for the spangle work inscribed to commemorate the 70th Newman anniversary. A Strongs of Romsey pub for many years, it passed to Whitbread then in 1994 it was purchased by the family. Amongst the items on the walls, the pubs most striking image is the Leon Heron cartoon in the tap room entitled 'Got to be cruel to be kind' - dated 1936 it shows a chimney pot on the former stable block i.e. after the conversion into 'the big room'. The pub still retains outside gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets which have been modernised. \r\n\r\nOn the far left of the pub in an extension built in about 1850 there is now a museum containing a collection of fossils, stones etc. Opened in February 1998 and dedicated to Raymond Newman, who started the collection and now carried on by his son Charlie - admission is free and it is open pub hours. The room was originally brought into use in the mid-1970s as a children's room. The square and compass are stonemasons basic tools - the pub holds a Stone Carving Festival in the last week of July and the first week of August. It is a forum for professional carvers who are at the pub each day and, originally held in Swanage, it moved here 10 years ago when the council stopped funding it and so Charlie invited them to hold it at the pub. The climax is Square Fayre at the concluding weekend and during this time the pub is open all day every day. \r\n\r\nHas a Beer and Pumpkin Festival the first weekend in Oct when up to 40 real ales from small breweries are available, Cider and Sausage Festival the first weekend in November when about 20 ciders are available. They usually sell as much real cider as real ale here. The big old 1953 AC car in front of the pub has featured in two films and the TV series Midsomer Murders.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2019. \n\nThe Estate owners have converted the interior into one that resembles thousands of country eating pubs. This pub has therefore been re- categorised as Interior Ruined. The former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nRebuilt in 1857 and opened as the Milbank Hotel in 1860, it is named after the local landowning family who own Barningham Park as well as the pub and a majority of the houses in the village and local farms. Since 1860 there has only been three names over the door with Sam Turner taking over in 1939 and since 1987 it has been Neil Turner. Entering the pub you could be forgiven to thinking you are in someone's house as there is no bar counter, you stand at the top of the cellar steps to get served. This area has some dispensers attached to the wall and around the staircase to the cellar is a collection of, at last count, 2021 miniatures which started in 1963. This is one of only eight traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; Red Lion, Ampney St Peter, Gloucestershire; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.\n\nOnly one of the original three rooms is in regular use which is the tap room on the left. This small room has partly old half-height panelling, fixed seating all around the walls, baffle by the door and its old fireplace has new tiles. Note the cocktail menu listing 85 with the most popular being Sex on the Beach and Snowball. Parties of people come from nearby towns to sample them and as the pub does not serve food, some folks bring their own! \n\nA carpet now covers the flagstone floor in the passage and main room. The Domino Room to the left is now only used occasionally for meetings and in fact is in use as a private room during the daytime. The room with a '1' on the door to the right of the passage was only brought into use at very busy times such as Christmas closed in 1969. It was called the dining room as it was where villagers came on the 2nd Tuesday in January and July to pay their rents and the licensee cooked a meal for the tenants. In summer there is a local outdoor quoits league and the pub plays on the green outside the pub on Monday evenings. Outside gents'. Closed Mon. to Sat. lunchtimes.",

        "Address": "63 Saddler Street, Durham, DH1 3NU",
        "Description": "UPDATE 2014.\n\nConversion to a plain city centre pub much like thousands of others occurred in 2014 when the original bar back and bar counter were replaced by modern ones. \n\nThe former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place.\n\nThis small pub occupies a late C18 or early C19 brick building, just one bay wide and with colourful leaded windows. Miraculously for a city centre pub it retained its three-roomed layout including a minuscule snug right up to 2011, despite being owned by RBS, operated by S&N Pub Enterprises and not having the protection of statutory listing. Sadly, in 2011 the partition that formed one of the walls of the snug was removed opening up the snug to the public bar. The very small public bar still retains the original counter and bar-back but they have been painted over, have minor modern changes such has removal of the old spittoon around the counter and its wooden cover, and a new bar top added. Other recent changes include the removal of the original fixed seating and a baffle in 2003. \n\nA half-height panelled passageway from the rear of the room goes around the former snug, which was originally entered from the rear of the pub. This tiny room created by partition walls had already been subject to changes in 2003 when the top third part-glazed section of the wooden partition wall between the snug and the public bar was removed and the panelling painted over. Also removed was the fixed seating attached to the walls; but a Victorian tiled fireplace previously covered-up was exposed. There are still signs of the 'table service' bell pushes. \n\nThe rear Fives Room was brought into use some years ago and was doubled in size by extending to the rear in 2008 and is on two levels. Note the glazed brick wall and pillared entrance in Moat Side Lane (part of the Pilgrims Route to Durham Cathedral) on the right-hand side of the pub.",

        "Pub Name": "Victoria Inn",
        "Address": "86 Hallgarth Street, Durham, DH1 3AS",
        "Description": "Built 1899 by famous North East architect Joseph Oswald for local innkeepers J. A. Lumsden & Co. It is built of red brick with a carved stone cartouche of the head of a youthful Queen Victoria and the building date of '1899' above the right hand door. There are mosaic tiling floors in both the entrances - the left main pub one and right hand one used by people stopping the night in the three en-suite rooms. Possibly the most intact/ preserved pub in the whole of North East England, which is due to the actions of owner Michael Webster, who has been here since 1974. In the early 1990's Scottish & Newcastle Breweries wanted to alter the pub, but he refused to allow this and instead asked the brewery to sell it to him, which they did in 1995! \r\n\r\nThe people who regret the passing of those bygone days will be relieved to find that the Victoria Hotel concentrates on those essentials of a good pub - good conversation and good beer (all cask ales are from local micro breweries) - and has ignored the march of so-called progress - there is no Juke Box, pool table, fruit machine, no children, the only food is toasties. \r\n\r\nThe pub retains its three small rooms and the outstanding feature is a rare completely screened 'Family Department', a term for an off-sales only seen in the North East of England and also in Scotland situated at the rear of the public bar. The name comes from the fact that women and children would often fetch the families supplies of ale and they had to do this without being seen by or seeing the men in the public bar - note the disused door down the left side of the pub that was the access to the tiny room. \r\n\r\nIt retains it door with 'Family Department' etched and polished glass panel and consists of a curved wooden screen with decorative brilliant cut glass panels, one also curved with small hatch to the bar. The wall has old dado panelling and just enough space for standing room and also to hold a telephone and cigarette machine (removed in recent years due to the proliferation of mobile phones and the smoking ban respectively). Perched on top of the curved screen are a row of ceramic spirit barrels including ones with \"sherry', 'Stingo' and 'I Whisky (the \u2018I\u2019 being from the days before the fad of inserting an \u2018e\u2019 to distinguish the Irish from the Scottish variety), as well as an old Bakelite wireless (radio). \r\n\r\nThe Public Bar has a bare wooden floor, original fine tiered bar-back with wide segmental arches at the top and in the upper part, an unusual partially enclosed shelf with a miniature balustrade and containing a collection of figurines, Toby jugs, 40 malt scotches and 40 different Irish whiskeys. The bar counter is of mahogany, there is an ornate black painted Victorian tiled fireplace with wood surround including a small circular bevelled mirror and coal fire. The fixed bench seating with a baffle at the rear is original, the seating at the front looks to date from the 1960s. \r\n\r\nNote the set of brilliant cut glass window screens - on the Hallgarth Street side is a 'Victoria Hotel' one in the centre, a decorative deep etched one on the left (but the right hand side one has a frosted glass replacement); and on the left hand side a 'Bass' Ales' one and two decorative deep etched ones. There is an etched and polished glass 'Bar' panel in both the front inner door and the rear door. Note the bell box high up near the fireplace from the days of table service. It has 'Club Rm', Sitting Rm 1' and 'Sitting Rm 2\" windows and is still in working order - press a bell in the rear Sitting Room and watch the small disc in the Sitting Rm 2 window move from side to side to indicate where the service was required. The bell push in the front sitting room also works but the disc does not move any more. The Club Room was upstairs and is now bedrooms. \r\n\r\nAccess to the Snug or rear sitting room is from the passage at the rear with a door having a 'Sitting Room' brilliant cut glass window or the right hand entrance passage with a modern door replacing the original which had a 'Sitting Room' glazed panel. This small room has its original fixed bench seating with baffles at each end, half-height old panelled walls, bell pushes, original cast-iron and marble fireplace with a coal fire and service is through a sliding hatch to the back of the bar. \r\n\r\nThe front right small room has 'Sitting Room' etched and polished glass panels in both doors and a figure '2' on the back of a door to the public bar. It has a bare wooden floor, a small original panelled bar counter with no dispensers and original bell pushes in the half-height old panelled walls. There is another ornate black painted Victorian tiled fireplace with blue decorative tiles and a small circular bevelled mirror in the ornate mantelpiece. Three window screens here but only one retains its original decorative etched panel, the other two having replacement frosted glass. In the corner on a shelf are more ceramic spirit barrels 'Gin', 'Rum', 'Brandy'. There is a passage between the two sitting rooms there is an old 'Worthington's Burton Ales' mirror.",

The great feature here is the small tap room (centre left) with service via a door-cum-hatch. The fittings are very simple fittings: just left of the entrance is a timber screen behind which a tiny drinking area with seats round three sides: one of these benches has a has a hole in it the traditional pub game of tossing the penny, and a drawer beneath for collecting successfully tossed coins. The herringbone parquet flooring and brick fireplace probably date from around 1930. Basic pub rooms existed like this in their thousands \u2013 but now they are a great rarity thanks to 'progress'|! The public bar on the far left became part of the pub later and retains its wall bench seating: the counter is probably relatively recent.\n\r\nThe room on the right labelled \u2018Private Bar\u2019 changed to its present style in the post-war period when it was decided to bring the fourth room into public use and add the counter, still in an inter-war style, spanning the two right-hand rooms. The plaster was removed from the two right-hand rooms in the late 1970s and the fireplace in the private bar is from this time. The window at the front on the far right was formerly the site of a doorway but this was closed following subsidence and movement after one of the hot, dry summers in the 1970s. The pub was run by the Beard family from 1938 to 2005. The pub holds beer festivals (50+ beers) over four days on Easter weekend and the August Bank Holiday weekend.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2023\u00a0 After being closed since 2014, the pub reopened im May 2023, initially with limited opening hours. Happily, there have been no changes to the pub's historic core.\nOne of the great unspoilt rural classics. The pub occupies two rooms in a 300-year-old stone-built cottage. It was bought by Tetbury Brewery Co. in 1851, which was taken over by Stroud Brewery in 1911. The oval inn sign is a thick metal Stroud Brewery one. In the 1950s Stroud Brewery and Cheltenham and Hereford Brewery amalgamated to form West Country Breweries \u2013 note the \u2018West Country Ales 1760 Best in the West\u2019 ceramic wall sign by the entrance door. The little changed interior is due to the remarkable fact that the last licensee John Barnard was only the fourth since 1851.\n\r\nThe porch leads to a central corridor. Service is in the small public bar on the right with a \u20182\u2019 on the door but arrangements are not what you would normally expect. This is one of only eight traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; Milbank Arms, Barningham, Co. Durham; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.\n\r\nYou will find a long bench which creates a narrow area for the licensee to operate in with just a couple of handpumps mounted by the back wall and a stool where he sits.\n\r\nThe last change to the interior of this pub is probably the adding of a red Formica top to one of the shelves in the old cupboards to the left of the narrow area. Note the glass model of the interior of the pub situated on one of the shelves. This quarry tile-floored room has a wooden dado panelling, wall bench seating and a window seat. In the corner is a Minster concrete fireplace, one of 50 added to pubs by Stroud Brewery in c.1950. (There was one in the left hand room but it deteriorated and had to be replaced.) Note the old ring on a piece of string on the wall which operates a bell - this is now only used by customers if John is cleaning glasses in the kitchen.\n\r\nAcross the corridor is another room behind a timber screen forming the left hand wall to the passage. There are simple benches against the wall, a baffle by the door and a brick and wood surround fireplace. In the corridor with its parquet floor there is a small sliding hatch through to the \u2018servery\u2019 which was the original off sales. It is still in use today by customers of the second room when it is too busy in the bar to get served. They slide the hatch and order the beer through it. No new-fangled inside loos here \u2013 both the ladies\u2019 and the gents\u2019 are outside on the left.\n\r\nThe pubs opening hours were Mon 6pm to 9pm; Closed Tue to Thu; Fri 6pm to 9pm; Sat 6pm to 9pm; Sun 12pm to 2pm only; but in the evenings the pub may close early if no customers.",

        "Pub Name": "Kings Head",
        "Address": "60 Victoria Street, Bristol, Redcliffe, BS1 6DE",
        "Description": "A mid 17th-century building with a wonderful long, narrow, one room bar, the Kings Head can justifiably boast a unique interior and some of the oldest bar fittings in the whole of the UK. In the early 1970s it was under threat from redevelopment of the area and only a petition by regulars which included getting it statutory listed saved both the pub and its rare interior. The interior was refurnished about 1865 and again probably about the turn of the nineteenth century. Running all along the right hand wall is a wonderful bar-back of c.1865 with a series of arches and high-level gilded, green and black glass panels advertising various drinks. This may be the oldest surviving bar back in the country, with the other possible contenders being the Victoria, Bayswater, London W2 dating from 1864, and the Red Cow, Richmond\n\r\nThere is a bar counter also of c.1865 (the counter top, however, is of 1998 and replaced a Formica one from c.1960) with decorative brackets stretching halfway into the building with only a narrow area for drinking in front of it and around the front window where they is some old fixed seating.\n\r\nThe majority of the rear half of the pub contains the curiously named 'Tramcar Bar' - a snug shaped like a tramcar with just a narrow passage running alongside it to give access to the snug, toilets and rear door. It looks as though the counter was much larger but it seems it was cut back for the insertion of the delightful partitioned-off area probably around c.1900. There\u2019s no proof but all of the fixtures and fittings bear all the hall marks of George Parnall\u2019s, a company based nearby to the pub as they were one of the finest bar and hotel fitters who claim one of their last ever jobs was fitting out the QE2. Prior to the insertion of the tramcar bar, apart from the small seated area at the front under the window, this was probably a stand-up only drinking establishment. Originally the bar counter with a marble top ran all the way to the rear.\n\r\nThe six sections of the bar back fitting in the front area have gilded panels at the top advertising 'Claret', 'Hollands' (a Dutch gin), 'Cigars', 'Mineral Waters', 'Cigars' and 'Port & Sherry'. In the Tramcar bar part the wording above the five panels is 'French Brandy', 'Irish & Scotch Whiskey' (note the 'e' - nowadays the Irish product is always spelled with an \u2018e\u2019 and the Scotch one without, a distinction that only became normal in the twentieth century.) 'Jamaica Rum', 'London Gin', and 'Cordials'. Note that the shelf of the bar back fitting at bar counter level is of white marble. Most sections of the bar back have a mirrored panel. The fourth section of the back fitting contains a colourful large glass panel in gold, green, cream and red advertising 'BURTON ALES AND DUBLIN STOUT' (signed by one, Fred Brean of Bedminster and dated 1860). A restoration in the early 1970s saw this brought back to its finest glory having previously been covered in 16 coats of emulsion. The fifth 'Cigars' panel is also a door to private quarters. The back fitting has columns with capitals holding up the top section. Look for the old gas pressure gauge that enabled the landlord to adjust the pressure within the pub to accommodate fluctuations in the supply \u2013 such as when the street lights were turned on!\n\r\nAll the way down the left hand side of the pub is old dado tongue and groove panelling, which is also on the right hand side of the 'tramcar' section. The entrance to the snug is via a door at the rear held open by an iron rod. The wooden partition walls of the snug have a glazed panel at both the front and rear. The short section the other side of the door is held in place by a cast-iron stay to the ceiling, it has seating round the sides and bell-pushes from the days of waiter service. Look for the gas lit Cigar or Pipe Lighter on top of left-hand bench-back in the Tramcar Bar. There is a hatch / flap / doorway at the bar end of the tramcar bar for service and access for staff. There are two tiny toilets (WCs) formed by part glazed partitions situated adjacent to the rear wall - note the 'Ladies Only' in black and red on cream coloured glass panel on the door. The inner rear door has a 'Bar' etched glass panel.",

        "Description": "Three-storey hotel built 1869. It is included here for the impressive arcading with round arched, twisted, hollow brass columns. In the spandrels glass roundels with an eagle surrounded by a belt bearing the emblem 'Strength' (of what is this the emblem?). Spectacular cornice below the ceiling (the ceiling rose was added in 2008). The arcading originally ran all along the side wall i.e. presumably behind a long bar counter? In the sometime last century the room was sub-divided by the creation of a second small lounge bar to the left by the insertion of a partition wall and a mezzanine floor added for inside toilets. Whilst the lower section of the arcading still runs all along the wall into the second room, the top sections and twisted brass columns were moved at right angles and now are situated on the rear room of the main bar. Both the main room, which has a notable slope, and the smaller room have modern furnishings.\r\n\r\nA little history: plans were approved by the Council on 8 April 1869 for the developer, Thomas Morgan whose initials appear in carved roundels. the building was probably complete in late 1870 and was leased to  by one John Sharp who was a wine, spirits and porter dealer in Christmas Street until 1870. By 1871 he had moved to West Street and this new, purpose-built building. You can still detect his name in the fascia outside. Sharp remained here till 1875 but in 1876 Thomas Morgan was listed here. From 1880 to 1885 we have Blacker Bros., spirit dealers, on the site: in 1887 the Palace name appears in the directories for the first time when the occupant was Mrs Blacker.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2016. Converted to residential use and therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nNow situated on a dead end section of the old A417 but well worth the effort to find. This is one of the best examples in the country of how to convert a totally unspoilt pub of two rooms into a five room gem but still retaining the historic core. The pub was kept by the Ruck family for 65 years until Ivy Ruck died in 1995 (her photo hangs in the bar). The present owners, Jo Carrier and his father John, carried out many much-needed repairs.  The oldest part of building is the original 17th-century building on the left, which was extended in the 18th century with a taller block on the right. Needless to say it is all built of local stone with a Cotswold stone slate roof. The earlier part contains two bars which are real gems - especially that on the left with two high-back settles (one them curved) with bench seating attached. They would have been a familiar sight in country pubs - they were designed to keep draughts off the customers as they clustered round the open fire - but are now very rare. \n\nThere are only a handful of similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire; ;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk ; and Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\n\nThe right-hand bar with a '2' on the door has a fixed bench running round the bay window and which appears to be of considerable antiquity. It retains the old counter front with a modern bar top, the bar back shelves appear to have been replaced in recent times but the brick fireplace with a log fire is at least 50 years old. Downstairs to the rear of the snug was Ivy's sitting room and the old fireplace has been preserved. From here steps down and a short passage leads to another additional bar with flagstone floor, built-in settle seating and a solid bar counter - all work of 1996. A staircase returns you to Mrs Ruck's entrance hall. To the far right another room has been brought into use. It has an old fireplace with log fire and a good ceiling rose. We strongly recommend a visit to the old part of the Five Mile House where you can still get a strong sense of what many small country pubs used to look like.",

It doubles up with a smallholding in the way that so many rural pubs did in times gone by. The red-brick building with views of the River Severn has a long history with the central part being extended in the mid 19th century. A part-glazed exterior porch has bare benches on both sides. Through the front door is a hall with a red and black tiled floor laid diagonally and a settle that goes to the private quarters and a door on the left leads to the public bar.  \r\n\r\nThe present arrangement of a tiny drinking area in front of a servery (with old counter and bar-back shelves) probably dates from Victorian times. It has a quarry-tiled floor laid diagonally, old dado panelling and a bare window seat. It is in this tiny area you will find a loyal band of locals drinking and chatting to the licensee about all things local and beyond.  \r\n\r\nOn the left through an old door that is always open is a separate room with a genuinely old flagstone floor, large curved high-backed settle, large stone fireplace with a log burner, two old tables, a piano (which is still played occasionally) and a hatch to the side of the servery. The only recent change was the building of indoor toilets behind this room in the 1960s.  \r\n\r\nThis is one of a fast disappearing type of pub offering the essentials of good conversation and good beer - there is no food, no TV, no pool table, no fruit machine (and piped music is at a very low level).  \r\n\r\nThis pub closes for the winter on 26th October 2015 and will not re-open until 18th March 2016. The hours are 7-10pm plus 12-2 on Sat, Sun and Bank Holidays.

        "Pub Name": "Olde Mitre",
        "Address": "1 Ely Court, Ely Place, Hatton Garden, EC1N 6SJ",
        "Description": "Finding this vibrant, historic pub in a tiny alley between Hatton Garden and Ely Place is a test of pub-going initiative, but success will be rewarded by a range of real ales and guest beers. It is said to have been founded in 1546 to minister to the servants of the Bishop of Ely who had his London residence in the vicinity. The site and adjacent properties in Ely Place were cleared when the Crown took over the area in 1772. It was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century. The building has three storeys with glazed timber front on the ground floor. The interior is a remodelling of around 1930 with lots of panelling in the then-fashionable Tudor style. There are two rooms (both called \u2018lounge bar\u2019) either side of a central servery, a small, cosy one at the front and a slightly larger one at the back. Off the latter is an intimate little snug, now named \u2018Ye Closet\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe front bar is completely panelled to picture frame height, it has a 1930s panelled bar counter and the bar back shelves look to be of similar date, but some may have been added later. The fireplace has a 1930s brick interior and a marble exterior. Note that there were originally three doors into the room but it has been a single space since the 1930s. The corner of the front bar near the entrance is glazed in to reveal the trunk of what is said to be a cherry tree - note the plaque above stating \"The Mitre Tavern - Built by Bishop Goodrich in 1546. The Cherry Tree marks the boundary between the Bishops Garden and the part leased to Sir Christopher Hatton (who was Queen Elizabeth I's courtier). \r\n\r\nBy the entrance and between the front and rear bars note the original off-sales hatch. The rear room is also completely panelled to two-thirds height with a small 1930s panelled bar counter. This small room has a fireplace of 1930s brick with a cast-iron and wood surround; there are fine carved chairs, an old settle and it is lit by a skylight. Off to the left is 'Ye Closet', a tiny snug measuring some six feet by ten feet and completely fielded panelled to two-thirds height with settle-like benches around an oblong table. \r\n\r\nLook for the narrow staircase, the walls of which are covered by wide, horizontally-laid panels which may date back to the original late C18 construction. The upstairs \u2018Bishop\u2019s Room\u2019 - which is open at busy times -was fitted out about 1990. The interior is small and many customers stand outside to drink using as tables the array of casks running all along the passage around the exterior of the pub. This passage has glazed tiles above the dado and it leads to the outside gents' \u2013 how rare is that in a London pub?

        "Pub Name": "Hand & Shears",
        "Address": "1 Middle Street, Smithfield, EC1A 7JA",
        "Description": "Popular with office workers at lunchtime and early evening, this is one of the best-kept secrets among City pubs and looks as hundreds, if not thousands, of plainly furnished London pubs did a century ago. The pub was rebuilt in 1849. The pub name comes from Bartholomew Fair when the Lord Mayor cut the first cloth at what was England\u2019s greatest cloth fair (the fair was granted a royal charter in 1133 but suppressed in 1855 amid fears about public disorder). The upstairs function room is named after 'The Court of Pie Poundre' which was held in the upper room of the old Hand & Shears. Meaning the 'Dusty Feet of the Suitors', the court sat during Bartholomew Fair to set weights and measures, grant trading licenses, and impose penalties on fraudulent traders. \r\n\r\nThe corner entrance has an unusual pair of curved doors. There are in fact several doorways, each leading into a separate drinking space around the central servery. Two of these spaces are named in the door glass, which looks like a refitting (along with the window glazing) from the 1930s. So we have, on the right, the \u2018saloon\u2019 and left of this is a cosy little \u2018private bar\u2019. There are two doors into the front room so this may indicate there was an off sales here. The whole room has full height panelled walls. There are 1930s brick fireplaces in the left hand room and the rear room. The island bar back fitting is wonderful with a baking of etched and frosted mirror panels on both sides. \r\n\r\nThe pub had to close for 18 months in 1982/3 following structural damage caused as a result of piling at the Founders Hall opposite. The underpinning exercise that took place included a new concrete floor in the cellar and the ground floor has a new wood laminate floor. To lay this the island bar counter, island bar back fitting and the partitions/screens were moved and returned to their places. While the screen that creates the left hand room is a good fit apart from where the bar top meets the rear part; and the rear and front right screens appear to be in their correct positions, there are gaps between the end of them and the bar counter. Also the bar counter has a number of joins indicating it was cut into sections in order to move it to lay the new floor. \r\n\r\nA sensitive refurbishment in 1989 expanded the gents\u2019 slightly into the rear bar, installed the diagonal shelving over the servery, and replaced the iron columns but the overall character of the pub was carefully kept. A modern pot-shelf is suspended above three sides of the servery. The ladies toilet was added after the war being  the conversion of a store room. \r\n\r\nThe Hand & Shears claims amongst its famous visitors Stanley Baldwin, Prime Minister on 20th Oct 1930 and Winston Churchill, MP on 11th Feb 1931. They also claim that the term 'On The Wagon' originated here - this pub was used for the last drink when convicted men, brought here on a wagon, were on their way to Newgate Prison to be hanged - if the landlord asked \"do you want another' the reply was \"No, I'm on the wagon\" as the rule was one drink only! Back in the 1930s the Hand & Shears was famous for its meals -  in 1931 it served 650 lunches a week and in 1930 it served 28,500 lunches during the year. Lunches cost 10d in the public bar and 1s 3d in the saloon bar and sweets were extra.",

This corner pub, now with a major focus on good food, is part of an offices and flat development and, like the rest of the block, has characteristic 1930s detailing and metal windows. The architect was D. E. Harrington ARIBA. \r\n\r\nThe pub isn\u2019t big but has two unequally sized rooms. Decoration is pared down to a minimum and the fittings are sleek and undemonstrative. The counters have plain vertical surfaces and the bar-backs are simple and functional. \r\n\r\nIn the smaller rear room is an original brick fire surround and several Art Deco mirrors. The most prominent feature is a series of small, open drinking booths with timber and reeded glass partitions between them. The similar seating in the larger bar, however, looks like a later addition, perhaps from the 1960s or 1970s when the Ind Coope window glass must have gone in. Don\u2019t miss the loos which retain their 1930-s tiling. \r\n\r\nThe Duke of York is primarily aimed at diners although part of the larger bar welcomes drinkers too. The music played here is a suitable match for the surroundings.\r\n\r\nOther  surviving Art Deco interiors can be found at these Heritage Pubs Three Pigeons, Halifax, Yorkshire, West; Vale Hotel, Arnold, Nottinghamshire; Test Match, West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire; Portland Arms, Glasgow; Steps Bar, Glasgow; and Frews Bar, Dundee; in the Sporting Memories Lounge.",

        "Pub Name": "Cittie Of Yorke",
        "Address": "22 High Holborn, London, Holborn, WC1V 6BN",
        "Description": "A truly remarkable pub. It was rebuilt in 1923-4 (possibly to designs by Ernest R. Barrow) and is a self-conscious, romantic evocation of an Olde England. Part of the nostalgic mythology of the world of drinking is the idea of good cheer and company in the medieval great hall or Tudor inn - such is what we have recreated here. Outside in the four-storey frontage we have Tudor detailing in the windows. The entrance is on the right and leads first to a panelled room of the type common in inter-war pubs and which evokes ideas of the late-sixteenth or early seventeenth centuries. The bar counter is a modern addition. \r\n\r\nBut what really counts is the long bar at the back which seeks to rediscover the atmosphere of the great English timber halls. This amazing room is unlike any other in a British pub. The roof is high-pitched and open, and at either end, at first floor level, are glazed-in upper rooms from which you might imagine the lord of the manor might keep an eye on the proceedings below. In fact the room at the far end is, less romantically, part of the manager's flat! \r\n\r\nOn the right-hand side is a resplendent three-bay arcade with clerestory windows above. Beyond is an aisle is filled with seven small carrels which serve as drinking booths (there are three more at the rear left); such features are to say the least rare in traditional English pubs (but similar to the compartments which are prominent in historic Northern Irish pubs). On the left-hand side the dominant feature is a formidable array of casks, some of enormous side and evidently of some antiquity (as are the cast-iron columns supporting the shelving). A high-level walkway stretches the length of the room. Splendid triangular stove with a flue escaping under the floor. \r\n\r\nThe direct connection to the front room is a modern addition - this room has painted roundels of famous figures from history and did have a modern bar counter until it was removed in 2010. The brick cellars from the previous building form the Cellar Bar, but this is only open when food is served so is closed in the afternoons and after 9pm. The special character of this pub is reflected in its being grade II listed. Closed Sunday.",

        "Pub Name": "Black Friar",
        "Address": "174 Queen Victoria Street, Blackfriars, EC4V 4EG",
        "Description": "'Unique\u2019 is a much overworked word when it comes to describing pubs. But that\u2019s exactly what the Black Friar is. There\u2019s nothing else anywhere remotely like its fabulous decorative scheme, either in style or content. On a sharply triangular site opposite Blackfriars station, the pub was built in 1871-2, but what makes it so special is a remodelling from about 1905 by the then publican, Alfred Pettitt, and his architect H. Fuller-Clark. Fuller-Clark trained at the Lambeth School of Art and began practice in 1893. His artist was Henry Poole R.A., and both men were committed to the Arts & Crafts Movement which embraced a love of high-quality materials, hand craftsmanship, and often a very free, original approach to design. \n\nBefore entering the pub there is much to admire on the exterior. There is a deep mosaic fascia carrying the words \"Saloon / 174 / The Black Friar / 174 / Brandies\" on New Bridge Street side. A grand segmental arched entrance on the far left is surmounted by stone carved figures and above it a colourful mosaic of two monks fishing. The exterior lobby itself has walls and ceiling of marble. All along the exterior (well illuminated at night) are beautiful copper signs most featuring one or two friars such as a \u2018Worthington Ales in Bottle\u2019; two \u2018Worthington Ales on Draught\u2019 ones; \u2018To the Saloon\u2019, \u2018Booths Gin\u2019; and a couple of \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 signs, one of which bears a couple of friars pointing you towards the saloon and helpfully tells you it is 9 yards away. Above the corner door (no longer in use) is a \u2018174\u2019 in mosaic; a large stone figure of a friar; and a clock with a mosaic face. Above the Queen Victoria Street entrance on the right is a mosaic of a friar with wine in carafes flanked by stone carvings of friars. The fascia on this side has \u2018Brandies\u2019 in mosaic. \nThroughout the pub are friars \u2013 or at least jolly, modern reinvented versions of them \u2013 they appear everywhere in sculptures, mosaics and metal reliefs. So we have a theme (what\u2019s new about theming a pub?) based on the Dominican Friary established here in 1278. The whole thing is a glorious piece of nonsense but it\u2019s carried off with wit and verve. The most prevalent activities concern the serious matters of eating, drinking and generally enjoying oneself. Hence over the left-hand bar is a scene entitled \u2018Tomorrow will be Friday\u2019 showing fish and eels being collected for the ensuing meatless day. \u2018Saturday afternoon\u2019 above the arches to the second room sees the friars gardening and gathering produce. There is a magnificent fireplace recess, framed by a broad tripartite arch, which includes corner seats; a grate with fire dogs surmounted by imps; overmantel has bronze bas-relief of singing friars entitled \"Carols\", flanked by two friars' heads with swags above. Above the seats are marble panels with mahogany surrounds, monks\u2019 heads in copper relief and the word \u2018summer\u2019 on the left panel and \u2018winter\u2019 on the right panel. A stained glass exterior window depicts a friar in a sunlit garden. \n\nThe most special space is the arched windowless room with a barrel vaulted ceiling approached through three openings from the saloon area and added as a snack bar under the railway in 1917-21. There are two more copper reliefs on the pillars and on the inside walls of the entrances are six more reliefs. The small room is lined with marble and alabaster and has a series of jokey scenes in bas relief and inscriptions. The end walls each have a bronze relief, the south wall one is entitled \"Don't advertise, tell a gossip\" with a group of monks doing the weekly wash. The north wall one is entitled \"A good thing is soon snatched up\" depicting monks pushing a trussed pig in a wheelbarrow. On the cornice below, are devils representing music, drama, painting & literature. On the east wall are \u2018Industry is all\u2019 with a monk snoozing; \u2018Haste is slow\u2019; and \u2018Finery is foolery\u2019. On the west wall there is \u2018Silence is Golden\u2019; \u2018\u2018Wisdom is rare\u2019; and \u2018Seize occasion\u2019 has a friar boozing. The wording is in good electro-gilt letters by the Birmingham Guild. \n\nThe figures are signed by Poole and are found against the mosaic on the shallow vault. Side walls have six alabaster capitals illustrating nursery rhymes, 16 smaller capitals illustrating Aesop's Fables. Four marvellous lamp brackets with alabaster figures of Morning, Evening, Noon and Night holding up a bronze monk with water buckets. Just above the seating on the north wall is a further relief entitled \"Contentment surpasses riches\" depicting a sleeping monk surrounded by fairies, executed with mother of pearl and semi-precious stone inlay. This is just above a \"window\" which is an arrangement of mirrors with red marble colonnettes. Further mirrors here enhance the small space. This area now has a sign \u201cTable Service Only\u2019 and all the tables are set out for diners. Everywhere the craftsmanship is of the highest order, even down to the details of the doors. \n\nThe curved bar counter is no ordinary affair, being made of marble and timber with a buff marble top. Originally the main bar was divided by screenwork (hence the friars outside in the copper signs directing saloon-bound customers). Clearly therefore the pub had two separate rooms in Mr Pettitt\u2019s day and it is not hard to work out where the division would have run. As the two rooms were not originally connected, that no doubt explains why Pettitt and Fuller-Clark felt at liberty to more or less repeat the \u2018Saturday afternoon\u2019 scenes in both areas. By 1905 the great pub boom around 1900 had come to a halt and it is interesting to speculate how many other pubs might have been decorated on such lavish and original lines had it not done so. Occasionally there were extravagant evocations of the good old days of yore such as the great 'medieval' hall at the must-visit 1920s Cittie of York not so far away in High Holborn.\n\nThe interior of the Black Friar has featured in films such as Maurice (1987, Director James Ivory) and in the 1978 remake of The Big Sleep (Director Michael Winner) which features Robert Mitcham.",

        "Pub Name": "Olde Cheshire Cheese",
        "Address": "145 Fleet Street, London, Fleet Street, EC4A 2BU",
        "Description": "Rebuilt 1667. This is a celebrated old establishment in the annals of London pub history but its fame is such that it's best visited at quieter times such as mid-afternoon. After many years of private ownership it was acquired by Yorkshire brewer, Samuel Smith, in the early 1990s and serves their one and only real ale. It is hidden away up an alley off Fleet Street and is the result of a post-Great Fire rebuilding in the late 17th century. The frontage in the alley has reconstructed screens which can be rolled up and down to protect the windows. Note the 'fly-screens' behind the windows with the lettering 'OCC'. \nOriginally there was a newsagents and offices on the Fleet Street side. Until 1992 the pub consisted of 4 rooms on three floors and the cellars where there was a small bar. The building was extended to the east to create a new bar on the ground floor and above this the original rooms on the second and third rooms were made into two part rooms i.e. doubling their original size. A new bar was created out of the offices on the front side of the first floor; also a room on the third floor has been brought into use making at least 9 drinking areas altogether. \r\n \r\nThe two original rooms that are in regular use and accessible at all times are situated either side of the entrance passage. The one on the right is a small bar with what might be original panelling from the rebuilding, simple bench seating, a huge fireplace and Victorian counter. Over the entrance a notice from less egalitarian days, 'Gentlemen only served in this bar'. Under the adjacent glazed screen similar lettering 'Waiter service'. The waiters in question would no doubt have been those servicing the room to the left of the entrance. \r\n \r\nThis is the 'Chop Room', a panelled eating area which recreates the atmosphere of many an eating area in an old tavern. The fielded panelled dado has wall bench seating and as you enter is a 'cosy corner' formed by a four-sided bare benches around a table and which has curtains that can be closed for privacy. This room has an old marble fireplace. It also has a bare wood floor and like the public bar and passage still has sawdust spread over it every day \u2013 one of the last pubs to continue the tradition. \r\n \r\nAnother original room is the Williams Room on the first floor with a figure '3' over the door but this is currently only available for functions. It has a bare wood floor, 1930s fielded panelling on the walls and a good wood surround fireplace with an old fireback. The fixed seating near the door is a series of storage cupboards, there is another loose cupboard acting as seating, some fixed seating on the window side and pews. Although the room on the left appears to have been in pub use since the 1930s, through a doorway is another room created in 1992 also with a bare wood floor and fielded panels which are a copy of the 1930s ones. \r\n \r\nThe final original room is the Johnson Room on the second floor and acts as an overspill restaurant open lunchtimes only. This is another bare wood floor two part room with the original part being on the left. It has more 1930s fielded panelling on the walls and high backed seating of fielded panelling in bays with bare bench seating attached to them \u2013 note the numbers '1', '2' and '3' on the ends of what was historically referred to as \u2018traps\u2019. There has been some changes to this room \u2013 the tiny front right area was used by waiters and the front left seating bay was originally a kitchen entrance and so the seating here is modern work \u2013 take a look at the legs to confirm this. Again, there is a doorway to the second part of the room which was created in 1992 and has a bare wood floor and fielded panels which are a copy of the 1930s ones. \r\n \r\nA staircase near the two original ground floor rooms leads down to a small room and a two-part cellar all of which were in use prior to Samuel Smiths ownership. However, in the first small room, which has a replacement flagstone floor, there was up to 1992 a small servery. Beyond the room is a narrow barrel vaulted area like a wine cellar. On a much lower level is a large room with a three bay barrel vaulted ceiling and where the bar fittings were added in 1992. \r\n \r\nOn the ground floor there is a new bar created by Samuel Smiths in the early 1990s in the rear right area of the building. On the first floor is the Johnson Bar consisting of two rooms that were converted into a bar by Samuel Smiths in the early 1990s with new bar fittings in the first part and a small room on the Fleet Street frontage. There is a private dining room on the third floor with no old fittings.",

        "Pub Name": "Princess Louise",
        "Address": "208 High Holborn, London, Holborn, WC1V 7EP",
        "Description": "One of the great historic pubs of London, famous for its remarkable interior. The outside is a rather modest, slightly Italianate design of 1872 but the interior was completely remodelled in 1891 by the otherwise unknown Arthur Chitty. There is a most sumptuous display of tiling and mirrors which give the building exactly the sense of fantasy and gaiety its owners and architect must have wanted. The tiles are by W. B. Simpson & Sons and the glass is signed R. Morris and Son. See how the counter (with its island bar back) projects out into the bar so that staff could reach the customers easily. \r\n\r\nThe ground floor layout is like it was in Victorian times with a series of seven drinking spaces separated by mahogany partitions with decorative etched glass panels abutting the large U-shaped bar counter. However, in 2008 Samuel Smiths carried out an expensive refurbishment returning the lost screenwork that form the corridors down the left and right hand side, two small snugs on each side of the pub, and small separate bars at the front, rear left and rear right. The layout of many small drinking compartments is a style also seen at the Prince Alfred, Maida Vale, London W9 , the best example, Argyll Arms, Soho, London W1 and Salisbury, Covent Garden, London WC1.\r\n\r\nThe original partitions at the Princess Louise had certainly disappeared by the late 1960s, and maybe a long time before that to leave an open plan pub around the original island bar counter. The splendid island bar-back fitting is in two parts and is also the original mahogany one by W H Lascelles and Co. It is decorated with etched and frosted panels, an archway through the centre of the main fitting, which has lost all its lower shelving to fridges and is topped with a working four-sided clock.; a smaller fitting abutting a dumb waiter has some tiled panels as well as mirrors. \r\n\r\nThe exterior walls of the whole room has one of the finest displays of decorative tiling and gilded & etched mirrors anywhere, although there is also some very fine work at the Viaduct Tavern, Smithfield, London EC1; not far away. There is a tiled dado mainly of diagonally laid tiles and above it is a series of wide colourful tiled panels and gilded & etched mirrors alternating. Above this is a polychrome tile frieze decorated with urns and swags in deep relief. The floors of the two corridors and the entrance lobbies have mosaic floors. Highly ornate patterned ceiling is held up by a series of Corinthian columns with decorative capitals. The front space has double doors with deep etched panels from both lobbies, the counter front has decorative brackets but the fixed seating is more modern. \r\n\r\nIn the rear left bar, which has a modern lino tiled floor laid diagonally, you will see some more of the alternating tiled panels and mirror panels above a timber dado and topped with a polychrome tile frieze of urns and swags in deep relief. Some old fixed seating, two splendid colourful stained glass windows by W H Lascelles and Co. with titles of \u2018Music\u2019 and \u2018Drama\u2019 and three small stained and leaded panels above of mainly fruit. There is a Victorian fireplace with a fine wood surround featuring tiled panels (but a modern interior) with a large gilded and etched mirror above and lit by a skylight with yellow coloured pattern glass panels (probably modern). From the rear left room go down the staircase which has tiling on the walls and you will find another wonderful coloured stained glass window entitled \u2018Painting\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe rear right small room has more of the alternating tiled panels and mirror panels above a timber dado and topped with a polychrome tile frieze of urns and swags in deep relief, a good wood surround fireplace with decorative brackets holding up the mantelshelf and a mirror above, but the fixed seating is modern. The bar counter in this room was shortened and changed from one that was straight and finished at the rear wall to the present curved counter created by Samuel Smiths in 2008. Before you leave, gentlemen, have a pee(k) at the loos - a piece of lavatorial elegance exceeded only by those at the Philharmonic in Liverpool! It has floor to ceiling tiling, a (modern) tiled floor and three massive urinals by J Taylor & Sons Ltd. \nUpstairs is a bar that may be closed at times e.g. opens at 6pm Sat. It has a bar counter and bar back fitting that are Samuels Smiths replacements but are in a slightly different position to the previous ones. Look behind the servery and you will see some Victorian tiling on a passage and the room has a good cornice. \nPrincess Louise (1848-1939) was the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. Described by her mother as 'difficile', she led a racy life-style. There were several affairs with men from the world of art which was Louise's other great interest. Notoriously her mentor in sculpture, Sir Joseph Boehm died in her arms in 1890. She sculpted a statue of Queen Victoria which stands in the gardens of Kensington Palace. She was cremated at Golders Green Cemetery, thus becoming the first royal not to be buried.",

        "Pub Name": "Salisbury",
        "Address": "90 St. Martin's Lane, London, Charing Cross, WC2N 4AP",
        "Description": "Rebuilt 1892 and refitted in spectacular style in c.1898. One of the great turn-of-the-nineteenth-century palace pubs of London. It is part of a six-storey red-brick block built about 1899 and which incorporates a much older pub site (in the same way as the Paxton's Head in Knightsbridge) with. This site was leased from the Marquis of Salisbury in 1892 - hence the present name. Previously the pub had been variously known as of the Coach & Horses and the Ben Caunt's Head. The exterior with the deep relief figures over the main entrance; figures in the capitals of pilasters; and etched and polished glass in carved woodwork to the window frames gives some idea of what to expect inside - a splendid example of pub fitting as practised at the height of the boom around 1900.\n\r\nFirst of all the planning. The pub is remarkable for retaining one of its timber and glass screens and which defines and marks off a small bar on the St Martin's Court side of the pub. There would have been other such screens originally creating a cluster of bars round the servery in typical London fashion. The layout of many small drinking compartments is a style also seen at the Prince Alfred, Maida Vale, London W9 , the best example, Argyll Arms, Soho, London W1, and Princess Louise, Holborn, London WC1. It is not hard to work out where they would have been. You will note, for example, the way the counter top changes from wood to white marble and clearly this denotes what would have been separate areas within the pub. The abundance of etched and polished glass creates a glittering atmosphere: note that the etching on the large mirrors on the long wall and in the room at the rear of the pub is modern (it dates from some time in the last third of the twentieth century). The 'SS' motif you will see stands for the original name, the Salisbury Stores.\n\r\nGrand vestibule on the corner entrance with engraved patterned glass in the doors. The two central panes are now plain glass whereas in recent times they would have been frosted and cut glass panes in them! The pub consists of a large now L-shaped main bar as result of a loss of some partitions. It retains its original long curved-ended mahogany counter, which along the left hand side of the room has a white marble top. It also retains the splendid original bar back fitting with highly decorative etched mirror glass panels right up to the ceiling; some lower shelving lost to fridges. Decorative cast iron columns holding up the Lincrusta ceiling. Old/original fixed seating in small niched bays with another display of mirrors behind reaching to the ceiling. Only the mirror on the left near the door is original, all the others are modern additions/replacements. All the wood surround is original with carved pillars regularly spaced along the wall. Note the Art Nouveau candelabra in copper taking the form of sinuous draped female figures holding aloft bouquets of flowers containing the light bulbs.\n\r\nThe small separate snug has its own door in St Martins court, and\u00a0has an original counter with carvings on pilasters where one section looks like a cupboard that folds down (?). Partition/screen above the original fixed seating is of four bays with highly ornate mirror glass. The exterior windows in two bays have more decorative etched panels in them. Good carved mahogany surround fireplace with modern interior. There is a dumb waiter here in use for meals. Baffle by the door with deep etched glass panel in the top. There is a door out to the rest of the pub and this room can be closed for private parties.\n\r\nThere is a separate \u2018Dining Room\u2019 at the rear with more modern mirrors all around the walls but the wood surrounds are old/original and no fixed seating. The then owners Scottish & Newcastle sensitively restored the pub in 1999. The work amounted to no more than a thorough cleaning of the inside and outside and reupholstering of the seats and is thus a model of how historic pub fabrics should be treated - in the old maxim of conservationists, 'do what is necessary but as little as possible'.\n\r\nThere are two old brass tables in front of the seating in the main bar, and these appeared in the famous black and white photograph of Marianne Faithful by Gered Mankowitz which was taken here for her album \u2018Come My Way\u2019 \u2013 the photo is on the wall and also hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. There is a photo of Dylan Thomas in the dining room which records his visit to the pub. Other famous people who have drank her include Michael Caine, Terence Stamp, Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor who celebrated their second marriage here in 1962.\n\r\nThe Salisbury has appeared in films such as the 1961 ground breaking film \u201cVictim\u2019 (Director: Basil Dearden); featuring Dirk Bogarde & Sylvia Syms \u2013 it was the first English language film to use the word \u2018homosexual\u2019; and Travels With My Aunt (1972, Director: George Cukor) which starred Maggie Smith.",

        "Address": "Dagenham Road / Rainham Road South, Dagenham, RM10 7UP",
        "Description": "For quality and completeness this is the finest 1930s pub in this book and, indeed, one of the best anywhere. It was built in 1937 for G A Smith & Sons, wine merchants and off-sales proprietors, whose name is still in evidence, notably on the former off-licence (now a scrap metal dealer's). The architecture makes considerable play of panels of brick alternating with render, and hipped roofs with pantile coverings. The left-hand projection (explained inside) makes the building decidedly asymmetrical. There are two separate bars known as the Oak Room (right) and the Walnut Room (centre) plus the left-hand projection which was called the Music Room \u2013 hence the stained glass depicting a variety of instruments and framed by wooden Tuscan columns. The room size can be varied by a folding glazed screen. There is another such screen to the elegant Walnut Room, named for the wood used for the counter (note its distinctive circular decoration) and the high-level screen above. Don\u2019t miss the Art Deco-style mirrors in the bar-back with their wavy decoration. More columns frame the front area. \r\n\r\nThe Oak Room (so-called for obvious reasons) is plainer and played public bar to the Walnut\u2019s saloon. Here the style is \u2018brewers\u2019 Tudor\u2019. So we have beams cased in to imitate sturdy timbers, exposed joists, Tudor arches in the servery area and much wall panelling. The counter and bar-back fittings are original but perhaps the most remarkable survivors are the half dozen glass and metal light fittings. In all, this is a truly remarkable survivor which will repay the trek out to see it. Grade II* listed in 2010 following an application by CAMRA.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2019. \n\nConverted to a food store where the historic fittings in two rooms have been retained, but now hidden behind supermarket shelves. This pub has therefore been re- categorised as Permanently Closed.  The former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nOne of the best examples anywhere to show how a typical, large, 1930s housing estate pub might have looked. It is in the popular, loosely neo-Georgian style combined with 1930s Art Deco streamlining \u2013 whence with broad curve which turns the corner from one elevation to the other. The Doctor Johnson opened in 1938 and was designed by the architect H. Reginald Ross for Courage, one of whose directors was an enthusiast of the great lexicographer. The latter appears high up on each elevation in bas-relief portraits by artist Arthur Betts. Architecturally the pub is not at all unusual for its time but what makes it special is the survival of the internal layout, four rooms, each with its own bar counter, ranged around the central serving area. \n\nOn the corner is the quadrant-shaped snug with Art Deco details. Left is the large public bar and right comes the saloon. Behind is a vast lounge which gives on to the garden. There are many original features to look out for such as the curvy Art Deco cornices in the snug and public bar, the fireplaces with their upright tiled decoration in the same rooms, the remnants of the revolving door to the saloon, and the incised and colour vertical lettering to loo doors. Bar-backs largely original but some shelves are lost and modern tiles fill the spaces in the public bar. Toilets refitted. Note the estate agent\u2019s office on the left. This was originally an off-licence linked to the pub cellar by a below-ground passage. \n\nDoctor Johnson was almost a trademark of Barclays, one of the great old-established London common brewers. He was a friend and adviser to Henry Thrale M.P. who inherited the brewery in 1758. The firm became Barclay, Perkins in 1781 and merged with Courage in 1955 to become Courage & Barclay Ltd (thanks to Bryan Lacey for this information)\n\nIf you visit you may be regaled with a fine tale about the origins of the pub. How come there is such a vast pub here? Answer: you will note it is on a long straight road heading out of London: the idea was that it would be a hotel-cum-pub for travellers heading in and out of London in need of rest and/or refreshment. Unfortunately, however, the route was changed so this big pub never came to fulfill its potential. A good explanation except for one thing. The highway out of London is Eastern Avenue was opened on 25 March 1925!",

        "Pub Name": "Salisbury",
        "Address": "1 Grand Parade, Green Lanes, London, Harringay, N4 1JX",
        "Description": "One of the grandest of all pubs built during the great pub boom in the closing years of the 19th century. After years as a run-down pub it was given a careful refurbishment in 2002-3 which has returned it to its former glory. The Salisbury went up in 1898-9, the promoter being John Cathles Hill, a self-made builder and developer who is said to have made the designs himself. He was also responsible for developing large swathes of housing nearby. The Salisbury is a companion piece to Hill\u2019s similarly splendid Queen\u2019s in Crouch End, N8, and the plans of the two pubs are very similar indeed. It is a three-storey (plus attic) pile which totally dominates its corner site. It is built of stone on the ground floor and has contrasted red brick and limestone on the upper floors. Particular features to note are the Larvikite (a flecked, black stone from Norway) columns which carry turrets above and the crown which tops the highest part of the building. The rich ironwork over and the mosaics and tiling in the generous porches give a foretaste of what to expect inside.\n\r\nOn the right, entering through the doorway marked 'Saloon Bar' one comes into the most lavish room consisting of a superb wide corridor with splendid mosaic floor; this space is reminiscent of drinking lobbies so popular in northern pubs (note also the couple of recesses for rather more private drinking). Although it has lost its skylight, the alcoves, plaster, mirrors and woodwork still make it very special indeed. At the rear the former billiard room retains its beautiful skylight decorated with vines that is now used as a restaurant and function room. The remainder of the pub is taken up with two bars surrounding an island servery of epic proportions. Originally there would have been more drinking areas within the large L-shaped bar on the corner with a vast island servery. The counter is a fine one with small, deep panels and wavy pilasters.\u00a0Behind is a largely original back fitting which bears pretty, delicate Art Nouveau painted details. Elsewhere, the decoration in the surviving etched glass is more typical of such work in late Victorian pubs.\n\r\nAlso look out for a series of unusual mirrors-cum-pictures which are found at several points in the pub. The only really unfortunate change at the Salisbury has been the intrusive creation of the toilet area between the two other rooms. The major and sumptuous addition in 2003 was the black and white marble floor in the corner bar: also the superb mirror (by Cakebread Robey & Co.) by the right-hand entrance which had been stolen, was replaced with a modern copy. The grade II* listing recognises the special importance of this grand and interesting public house.",

It\u2019s a companion piece to the magnificent Salisbury in Green Lanes, N4. Both were built by developer, John Cathles Hill who is said to have acted as his own architect. The layout is very similar to the Salisbury with a large servery in the centre surrounded by a series of rooms and compartments. There is a screen across the bar at the front. There is another screen just inside the entrance on the Elder Avenue side. On the right-hand side comes a saloon with a couple of alcoves and a spectacular decorated plaster ceiling and half-height panelling. The ceilings and deep friezes throughout the pub are immensely intricate in their decoration. There are lots of other features to admire, notably the beautiful Art Nouveau-style glass with roses and other flowers. \r\n\r\nThe bar counter is original and so is the circular entrance arrangement on the corner with a mosaic floor bearing the monogram of Mr Hill and Q for Queen\u2019s. Unfortunately the fitting in the centre of the servery has, for some reason, been replaced with modern work. The pub also suffers from an overpowering gantry atop the counter. A refurbishment in 2001-2 was a sensitive piece of work apart from the cutting of an opening in the screen.",

        "Description": "The Beehive is a purpose-rebuilt public house of the inter-war period, dating from 1927. A fine example of an unspoilt \u201cBrewer's Tudor\u201d pub. The designer is not known. The old layout is complete (apart from the removal of a screen) and you can fully appreciate how such a pub was meant to appear. On the left corner doors have \u2018Public\u2019 and \u2018Bar\u2019 leaded panels in them. The Public bar has fielded panelling to picture frame height (the \u201cwooden panelling\u201d actually being an imitation to help create the Tudor effect). It retains its original L-shaped panelled counter, original mirrored bar back, baffles by the doors, three of the original benches and two cased-in dart boards. Until 2012 behind the servery was a glazed-in office but the glazing has been replaced by wood. \n\nA front door has \u2018Off License\u2019 in a leaded panel and the off-sales is still intact with a small bar counter, but no longer in use. Another front door has a \u2018Saloon Lounge\u2019 in stained and leaded glass panel and through a vestibule is a spacious Baronial style right-hand room complete with mock original beams, more fielded \u2018panelling\u2019 to picture frame height and splendid light fittings. On the bar back in the lounge on the left there is some new wood and new tiles, the rest of the mirrored bar back is the original with a dumb waiter in the middle. There is a large red-brick fire surround on the rear wall i.e. in the \u2018saloon lounge\u2019 part and another at the end of the\u2019 luncheon room\u2019 part; The sliding screen that used to divide the Saloon Lounge (front) from the Luncheon Room (rear) has been removed but the glazing above it still remains. \n\nIn the passageway is a the door with a leaded panel \u2018Self Service Room\u2019, a rare if not unique room name (presumably linked to buffet-style food supply). It leads to a room used for darts and functions with more fielded \u2018panelling\u2019, modest skylight and a 1930s brick fireplace. Attractive brass door furniture throughout. Note that in this pub each door seems to have been numbered (up to 20 in the luncheon room) e.g. \u201814\u2019 on Luncheon Room door to ladies toilet \u2013 something not seen in any other pub. It was standard practice to number rooms in pubs until the 1960s (as required for control purposes by Licensing Magistrates / Customs & Excise), but individual doors is another matter. A further curiosity is the fact that the \u2018wooden\u2019 panelling is nothing of the sort \u2013 feel it and tap it and you will find it is an imitation to create a Tudor effect on the sly.",

        "Description": "Not far from Harrow School, the Castle was re-built in 1901 and has kept most of its original layout and fittings. The only real change is shown by an unused door down the side passage. When you are inside you would not know it was a door: it was the entrance to a separate off sales and the partition creating it was removed some time ago and the tiny area absorbed into the rear bar. Outside there is attractive 'The Castle' ironwork over the main entrance and a mosaic floor panel also with the name of the pub.\n\r\nThe front bare-boarded bar retains its original curving counter but the pot shelves on both bar counters are modern. This small room has a fine vestibule entrance with the figure '1' on the interior side - formerly a requirement of the licensing magistrates. The front bar is separated from the rear bar by a splendid and rare part glazed partition almost reaching the ceiling which has a low service door with only three feet headroom originally for staff to get from one part of the pub to another.\r\n\u00a0\nThe rear bar also has a vestibule entrance with leaded glass panels and the figure '3' on the inside. This bare-boarded floor room retains its original curving counter and bar back shelves on a glazed series of windows surrounding a (now unused) hatch serving the rear room on the right. To the left and right are two small back fittings with bevelled mirror panels. The original fireplace remains but it has some modern tiles and the gents' in this area has been modernised. At the back a door with the figure '5' on it leads to a large room described in the listing description as a 'Billiard Room', which has a wood-block flooring and imitation panelling on the walls. The door on the left originally led to the gents', and the fireplace has some modern additions.\n\r\nThere are two small rooms on the right. The front bare boarded one (now called the Clock Room) has an old cast-iron fireplace and a very small window from the servery perhaps 'for supervision purposes'. The rear right small room (now called the Snug) with doorways to/from the front and rear was hitherto served via the (now unused) large hatch to the servery. The dado panelling looks modern and the room has lost its fireplace.",

        "Pub Name": "Windermere",
        "Address": "Windermere Avenue, South Kenton, HA9 8QT",
        "Description": "Right by South Kenton station this is a good place to see how a typical large, inter-war suburban pub was planned and fitted up. It was built in 1938 or 1939 and is a large, red-brick, Dutch-gabled structure. There are three bars. The public bar, facing Windermere Avenue, is only used for parties and other functions. On the station side there is a saloon bar with a lounge behind. Original features include the large inner porches, bar counters, back fittings, wall panelling, wavy cornices, doors between the saloon and lounge, fireplaces (charming pictorial tiles with windmills in the saloon fire surround), and, in the saloon, an advertising mirror over the fireplace with Courage cockerel and a clock: the shape of the top reflects that of the gables outside. Sadly the original tiling in the loos was covered over by new work in about 2013. \r\n\r\nThe only significant change is the loss of the off-sales compartment which has been incorporated into the public bar. The fixed seats are additions and the superstructures on the saloon and lounge counters look like work of the 1950s or 1960s.",

        "Pub Name": "Crocker's Folly",
        "Address": "24 Aberdeen Place, St John's Wood, NW8 8JR",
        "Description": "Crocker's was a show-case Victorian pub of 3 storeys and attic, built in 1898-9 of red and plum brick. It has an elaborate, eclectic style to the designs (Oct. 1897) of architect C.H. Worley of Welbeck Street for the entrepreneur Frank Crocker. No expense was spared to fit it out and it served also as a hotel and restaurant, conveniently placed near Lord's cricket ground. \r\n\r\nThe front entrance leads into a spectacular 'grand saloon', as it was known (now the  'Marble Room'), which is set up for dining. Here the highlights are a splendid marble counter rounded at both ends, the bar back is of two large bays with the right hand one having an arch for staff to access the public bar, a superb large marble fireplace with paired columns and hood, marble walls and an elaborate plasterwork ceiling. \r\n\r\nOn the left through double doors is a large room (now 'Lord's Dining Room'), also used as a restaurant but, when the pub opened, this was a billiard room, accommodating two full-size tables: there was a platform for thirty people to watch the play. There is a not quite as ornate marble fireplace with a decoratively carved mantelpiece; the marble counter is a later insertion. Another elaborate plasterwork ceiling is another tour de force. When the hotel opened the restaurant was on the second floor and there was a concert room on the first floor. \r\n\r\nOn the right is the 1898 Bar, which it is thought had originally five separate compartments, all screened off from one another; but there is only two exterior doors leading into the room. One of these was reserved for ladies only. The original mahogany bar fittings remain. The bar back faces three directions with the left hand side having three mirrored bays and no loss of lower shelving to fridges but some replacement shelving above. Then there is a door with decorative multi-glazed panels which presumably led to the manager\u2019s office (now a kitchen) and above the door is a clock with the wording \u2018The Crown Hotel\u2019. From its opening until 1987 the pub was known as the Crown Hotel. On the return there is just the mirrored bar back screen as the bar counter here has been cut back.  All along the top of the back fitting are multi-paned mirrors. There is a deep freize all around the room with the detail picked out in gold. The pub was featured in the 1960s film \u2018Georgy Girl\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe name change arose because of a wondrously exaggerated story that Frank Crocker built this grand establishment to serve the Great Central Railway's new terminus. In fact this ended up at Marylebone over half a mile away. The story goes continues that Crocker went bust and then killed himself by jumping out of an upstairs window. In fact, Marylebone was a-building at the same time as the Crown and Frank died of natural causes at the tender age of 41 in 1904, a much-liked and respected member of the community. The website \u201cpubhistory.com\u201d quotes details supplied by a Moyna Wilson who states that in around 1924 the pub was run by Ethel Durden, Charles Durden, Bernard Barker and Clarence Barker as a family concern. Charles Durden later killed himself by jumping from the window on the corner, where the grand piano was (as opposed to a book by Richard Tames', which says that Crocker did this - this is wrong, it was my uncle). \r\n\r\nFollowing ten years' closure Crocker's reopened in 2014 after restoration as a high-quality restaurant and bar \u2013 please note if you want to view the Marble Room and Lord's Dining Room you are recommended to visit between 12 and 5 Monday to Friday.",

        "Pub Name": "Old Red Lion",
        "Address": "42 Kennington Park Road, Kennington, SE11 4RS",
        "Description": "Three-storey pub rebuilt 1933 by London brewers Hoare & Co of Red Lion Brewery, East Smithfield, at about the time they were being taken over by Charrington\u2019s of Mile End. Research by English Heritage as part of their Thematic on Inter-War Urban pubs has identified the architect as Sydney Clark.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent example of 'Brewers' Tudor' with its timber-framing exterior with brick infill at first floor level. Until 2010 it was possibly the most intact Brewer's Tudor interwar pub left in the country and it still remains fairly intact with the only changes made by new owners Antic carried at the rear to create a third room with alcoves (formerly the toilets) and adding an open kitchen on the rear left \u2013 these changes saw a wide gap created in the rear wall of the right hand bar and most of the rear wall of the left hand bar removed to reveal the kitchen. All the original fittings remain intact and even the inter-war tiled dado of the toilets line the walls of the alcoves. \r\n\r\nThe interior is split down the middle by a dividing wall with the servery sitting in the centre of the pub and staff have Tudor arched shaped doorways for access between the two sides. Both bars have masses of heavy timbering on the ceiling and walls, most of it with adze marks to create a sense of antiquity. There are two low (5 feet 6 ins.) narrow doorways at each end of the servery giving access from one side of the pub to the other; over one doorway a glazed panel with a Toby jug (the emblem of Hoare's, which was later adopted by Charringtons); over the other a glazed panel with a red lion. \r\n\r\nThe left door leads to a narrow bar with a bare wood floor and popular with diners. There is a timber baffle by the door with Tudor arch detailing. The original panelled bar counter on a raised tiled base remains as does the bar back with a Tudor arch shaped top section with carved decoration including grapes in the spandrels. But the lower shelves have been lost to fridges. On the left are two red painted Tudor-style fireplace surrounds with metal hoods and architect Sidney Clarke trademark spiral brick columns. Above are mock-heraldic cartouches featuring a Toby jug above the left one and a red lion above the right one. In between them is a built-in picture depicting the landing of Bonnie Prince Charlie in Scotland. \r\n\r\nThe right hand main bar has a wood block floor and a timber baffle by the door with Tudor arch detailing. The original panelled bar counter on a raised tiled base remains as does the bar back with a Tudor arch shaped top section with carved decoration including grapes in the spandrels. But the lower shelves have been lost to fridges. On the rear right is a red painted Tudor-style fireplace surround with a metal hood and architect Sidney Clarke trademark spiral brick columns and above is another heraldic shield. The toilets are now downstairs. On the left the single storey former off licence shop remains but is disused and there are plans to add more stories and create a function room.",

        "Address": "77 Borough High Street, London, Borough, SE1 1NH",
        "Description": "An amazing survivor from the days when Southwark was a major terminus for the coaching trade between London and southern England. The George was rebuilt in 1676 after a major fire in Southwark and is the last galleried coaching inn in London \u2013 but even this is but a fragment of its former self. It used to extend round the four sides of a courtyard \u2013 just as the New Inn in Gloucester does to this day. Part of it was demolished in 1889 to make way for the construction of railway warehousing. The galleries gave access to the first and second floor rooms have plain, white-painted balusters. The upstairs rooms are panelled and are particularly fine. Most of the pub\u2019s spaces involve modern fittings but the first bar you come to has some of the oldest woodwork purpose-fitted for a pub anywhere (some of it might even date back to the rebuilding of the inn). The two fireplaces suggest it was two rooms at one time but they have been amalgamated. \n\nThe larger part of this room has a mighty fireplace and a glazed-in servery with vertical sashes. Inside you can see a now disused set of \u2018cash-register\u2019-style Victorian handpumps (the handles move in quadrant-shaped slots to draw the beer) - they are reported as still being in use in the 1970s. The maker\u2019s name \u2013 South of Blackfriars Road \u2013 is prominent. A working set in daily use is at the  \nOld Crown, Kelston, Somerset;  \n\nIn the part nearest the road is full-height horizontal boarding;  simple fixed seating against the walls and in the window; and an ancient fireplace with a wooden hood. The tap room houses a 'Parliament clock' - in 1797 a tax of five shillings was levied on people who possessed a watch or clock. Not surprisingly many disposed of their timepieces and relied on clocks in public places. The one at the George was one such. The pub is owned and leased out by the National Trust which acquired it in 1937.",

        "Pub Name": "Half Moon",
        "Address": "10 Half Moon Lane, Herne Hill, SE24 9HU",
        "Description": "A tremendously exuberant piece of pub architecture with some marvellous fittings to match. The architect was J. W. Brooker and the building went up in 1896. There is a good sense of how the pub was originally divided up into separate rooms. In this case they have been reduced to three. A couple of them are named in the external glazing (which looks like a replacement in the 1930s), which also offers the blandishments of luncheons, snooker and billiards. The rooms are arranged around an L-shaped servery where the panelled counter and excellent bar-back survive. So does the panelling in the public bar. \n\nBut the biggest reason for making a trip here is the \u2018snug bar\u2019, tucked away at the back on the left. This has no fewer than six lovely back-painted mirrors depicting a variety of birds in watery surroundings. Two small labels helpfully inform us that they are the work of \u2018W. Gibbs & Sons glass decorators\u2019 of Blackfriars. In this room there is also a screen to the servery \u2013 but what a shame the snob screens have been removed from it. Two other screens have etched, cut and coloured glass with pretty lozenges depicting barley, hops and foliage. Four hefty iron columns with Corinthian-style capitals run down the ground floor making sure the upper floors stay where they are. \n\nOn the 7th August 2013 the pub suffered serious damage from flooding following a local burst water main and was closed for a lengthy period for repair, during which its future seemed uncertain. It was eventually leased by Fuller's with an initially planned summer 2016 reopening but this did not take place until 18 March 2017 after a major refurbishment. There is now a strong emphasis on food and the former billiard room (used in recent times for music events) is now a restaurant. The fixed seating is all from the refurbishment. 12 letting bedrooms have been added.",

        "Description": "A real inter-war time-warp now owned privately by James Blunt and set in a private, gated-off road close to the Chelsea football ground. It was built in 1896 as the Prince of Wales, changed its name to Bedford Arms about ten years later, and then to Fox and Pheasant in 1965. It was licensed simply as a beer house until as late as 1953. \n\nAs you enter there is a small lobby with an off-sales hatch to the servery and a door to the saloon bar (right): the door to the public bar was removed in 2017-18. Everything is quite low-key and what we see is typical of run-of-the-mill pub-fitting between the wars. The servery has glazed areas on each side, which house the spirits and glasses, etc, although the present lozenge-shaped glazing is a modern (2017/18) replacement for the previous glazing that contained rectangular panes of glass. The rear doors and windows have attractive dimpled glass with green bands. The 2017-18 work also saw the installation of the green tiled dado on the exterior, fixed bench seating in both bars, and the creation of a dining conservatory at the rear, though this latter has no adverse effect on the historic front parts. A private dining area for groups has also been made out of an upstairs room.",

The former description is shown below.\n\nStill almost exactly as it was on opening in August 1968, and, as such, a real time warp. Characteristic 1960s features are the triangular-shaped windows and the bevelled tiles beneath them. The late 1960s are on the cusp between traditional, multi-room planning and the modern, open pub. Here we still have a separate public bar (left) and a 'saloon lounge' (right) which is, in itself, split into two parts. The small area left of the saloon lounge entrance was originally intended as a 'jug and bottle' compartment but was never built as such, falling victim to the 1960s shift away from off-sales in public houses.  Original fittings such as the lapped counter fronts and mock beams in the ceilings: the display shelves between the two halves of the saloon lounge may be a slightly later addition.  Charlie Butler joined Young's in 1923 and became its head horse-keeper; he finally retired in 1966.",

        "Description": "A national treasure \u2013 the Red Lion has one of the most spectacular late-Victorian pub interiors anywhere \u2013 small but beautifully formed! It is claimed there\u2019s been a pub on the site since 1788. The present building went up in 1821 and was given a new pub front in 1871 by architect W. H. Rawlings though the fittings may be rather later. The actual trading area of the pub is tiny and surrounds a central serving area. Yet a century ago, small as it is, it would have been divided up into various separate areas \u2013 the three outside doorways are proof of that as are the names \u2018public bar\u2019 and \u2018private bar\u2019 in the door glass. The front part was probably divided up into three while the back area has always been a single space. \r\n\r\nWhat makes the Red Lion so special are the superlative etched and cut mirrors lining two of the walls. They create brilliant, glittering reflections to conjure up a magical atmosphere far removed from the prosaic world of everyday life beyond the pub. The picture is completed by an ornamental ceiling and frieze in both areas. The bar counter at the front has drop-down panels for servicing beer engines in former times \u2013 you can see the remains of the keyholes. Don\u2019t be fooled by the gantry fittings sitting on the counter top \u2013 like nearly all such features they are modern work (see how fresh the woodwork looks).",

Built as a hotel-cum-pub, it is a showy building of red brick with stone enrichments and on the ground floor are stone and granite pilasters. The interior has three distinctive sections \u2013 the main part on the right is almost U-shaped and would have been sub-divided by internal partitions  as there are three entrances to it; also a tiny screened \u2018private bar\u2019 on the front left and at the rear an L-shaped area restricted to diners at certain times.. There are castiron columns with stylised Corinthian capitals painted gold. \r\n\r\nThe left-hand entrance has a large lobby with a figure \u20185\u2019 on one of the inner doors.

The stairs to the cellar also lead from within the bar back. \r\n\r\nThe  private bar  at the front is formed by a three-quarter height timber and glass partition wall beyond which is the terrazzo floored passageway, which has a middle row of deep etched and frosted panels of a floral design and two low partitions attached to the counter. The low partitions have five narrow bays each, the middle of which is now a doorway having originally been a barrow door with good etched and frosted panels with floral designs. \r\n\r\nThe large public bar has a vestibule entrance on St Johns Hill side with lovely stained glass panel depicting a falcon in the right hand inner door and a \u2018Private Bar\u2019 panel on the left hand door.

        "Description": "This is one of the most exotic confections among London\u2019s pubs and was built in 1896 by the prolific pub architect, W M Brutton. Inside one can still get a good sense of how a lavish late-Victorian pub was organised and fitted up. Down both sides are tiled corridors that led into various drinking areas \u2013 you have to visualise every external or corridor door leading into a separate room or compartment. These were all served across a large, central counter with rounded ends. In the middle of this servery is a delightful island bar-back with delicate detail and an especially attractive octagonal display feature. Also note the etched glass in the outside windows and internal screens, the timber and plaster arches straddling the servery, the filigree of its supporting brackets, and the lovely friezes of various patterns and sizes. \r\n\r\nThe original spaces would have been relatively small for the most part, especially on the right-hand side. However, at the back is a large, long room with skylights that would probably have served as a billiard room, a feature that was common in many large late-Victorian pubs. The screen between it and the rest of the pub is magnificent with etched panels decorated with swags of foliage, ribbons, etc. Note the difference in quality between the original etched glass and the modern replacements. A refurbishment took place in 2002. This was done quite sympathetically with the only major change being the creation of an opening in the screen at the front to allow movement from one side of the pub to the other. \r\n\r\nA further refurbishment in 2015 has added more modern items such as stone-like tiling on parts of the floor and modern tiling above the Victorian bar back; fridges have replaced the lower bar back shelves. Typical of London pubs, areas can be reserved so at times you cannot visit all parts of the pub.",

        "Description": "The Argyll Arms is an astonishing survival and a welcome escape from frenetic Oxford Street with food and a good range of real ales available. It has one of the most important late Victorian interiors in the UK and, like the Prince Alfred, W9, shows how London pub proprietors and their clients liked small, cosy drinking spaces. However, whereas the Prince Alfred has a peninsula-style servery with radiating screens, the Argyll has a long, straight servery and a series of screened-off drinking areas sandwiched between it and the corridor. The building dates from 1868 but the fittings are from a c.1895 re-modelling undertaken for the proprietor E Bratt (the architect was Robert Sawyer).\n\r\nThe layout of many small drinking compartments is a style also seen at the Princess Louise, Holborn, London WC1 and Salisbury, Covent Garden, London WC1.\n\r\nAt the front there are two entrances, the right-hand one leading into a drinking area while the left hand double doors lead into a corridor with a terrazzo floor of mainly yellow with a green stripe down both sides that runs all the way to the rear bar. Lining the left hand wall above a panelled dado are a series of large brilliant cut mirrors in marble and mahogany surrounds separated by pilasters and a frieze at the top. The mirrors enhance the sumptuous atmosphere with reflections of the screens and glass opposite and light from the lamps. Down the right hand side are the partition walls of the three snugs \u2013 note the figures \u20185\u2019 and \u20186\u2019 on buttons just under the broken pediment over two doorways which were a requirement of the licensing magistrates.\n\r\nThe front right-hand double doors with carved brass handles lead into the first of three snugs formed by carved mahogany partition walls. This tiny room has a curved panelled bar counter of c.1895\u00a0(but the bar counter tops in all the rooms are modern replacements) and on the wall behind the counter is an enormous \u2018Bass on Draught\u2019 mirror. A doorway in the partition leads into the second snug with the c.1895 curved panelled bar counter and carved mahogany bar back fitting topped off with a deeply carved pediment. Originally the only access to the second snug would have been from the doorway in the corridor as in Victorian public houses you entered one room or snug from its own door.\n\r\nThe third snug is entered via the corridor and has a panelled bar counter of c.1895. There is a short baffle as you enter with glazed panel in the top section. The glazed partition between this snug and the rear bar reaches the ceiling and all of the partitions have acid etched panels. The highly decorated Lincrusta ceiling above the three snugs and corridor probably dates from 1868 and is painted a deep red colour.\n\r\nAt the rear of the servery is a delightful little manager\u2019s office with etched glazed panels all around it and topped off with a (modern) clock in an original carved mahogany surround.\n\r\nA partition / screen runs across the interior past\u00a0the three snugs. It is of three bays with a column rising from the bar counter with a widish gap for staff within the servery. In the double doors at the end of the entrance passage note the 'Dining Room' etched and cut glass panel in the right hand door (plain panel in left door).\n\r\nAt the rear is a two-part room beyond a partition which has two bays of decorative etched and frosted glazed panels and two less ornate top panels. Dividing the room into two is a wide archway which meets a column with capital rising from the bar counter; the part of the partition across the servery is of three bays with narrow etched and frosted glazed panels either side of a widish arch for staff with glazed panels all across the top section. The end section of the room has good mahogany panelling to two-thirds height featuring mirrors all along three walls - part from two plain ones in the servery area the panels are ornate etched and cut ones. A deep frieze runs all the way around the room and there is an ornate plasterwork ceiling and a number of mirrored panels (were there skylights here originally?)\n\r\nThe bar counter in the front section of the rear area looks old / original; the bar back fitting certainly is original with carved pediment at the top, bevelled mirror panels on the whole of the top section (lower shelving totally lost to fridges). In the rear part the counter is of a lower height but still looks old / original but is not in use as this part of the servery is a glass washing area with a modern frosted glass screen on top of the counter.\n\r\nAt the rear is a staircase curved at the bottom with good cast iron balustrade leading to the upstairs dining room. The good bar fittings and mahogany panelled walls with lots of bevelled mirrors are all modern. The marble fireplace with splendid carved mahogany mantelpiece featuring columns and reaching the ceiling does look old.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020. Still closed. An application for a lawful development certificate for residential use was refused in 2017 and dismissed at appeal in early 2018. \n UPDATE 2016:  Closed July 2012 and become a private residence on the upper floors. As of January 2015 the Council stated that officers would be keeping an eye on the building to make sure that a lawful change of use to a single dwelling house does not occur by default through any residential occupation of the ground floor for a period of four years or more. \r\n\r\nDescription before it closed.\r\n\r\nThis drinkers\u2019 local is a good example of a largely unaltered, modest Truman\u2019s pub of about 1930. Planned as part of a housing development, it retains its separate public bar and saloon. The former is the larger but in terms of fittings there is little to differentiate them. Both have wall panelling and fixed seats and the counters are the same plain, panelled design while both bar-backs each have an Art Deco clock. Many pubs had spittoon troughs in front of bar counters and that in the saloon bar here is an excellent example. This trough has timber edging and is lined with brown and white chequered tiles. There\u2019s even a small opening at the counter corner to sweep the bits and pieces together.  \r\n\r\nOther original features are the brick fireplaces and, in the saloon, typical Truman\u2019s lettering on the panelling advertising their wares. There is original tiling in the saloon bar. The one big change is the loss of the off-sales compartment \u2013 traceable in the closed doorway on the (puzzlingly named) Riverside Gardens side and the stopped-off spittoon trough. There is a pleasant garden area beyond a loggia outside the saloon.",

        "Pub Name": "Windsor Castle",
        "Address": "114 Campden Hill Road, Kensington, W8 7AR",
        "Description": "A well known pub for this affluent neighbourhood, the Windsor Castle  is the most complete surviving example of an inter-war version of the survival of Victorian-type drinking arrangements right down to the 1930s. This plain, two-storey building of around 1825 sits at the summit of Campden Hill Road and was refitted about 1933. We know this because in the \u2018Sherry Bar\u2019 there is a plaque helpfully explaining that the oak used in that room was felled in the period 1930-32. The 1933 refitting created three small rooms separated by screens on the left-hand side of the property. Also helpful is the fact that the door glass names each of the three traditional rooms in red paint on frosted windows. \n\nThe Sherry Bar is entered off Peel Street, the Private Bar is on the corner, while the Campden Bar lies along Campden Hill Road. Perhaps it says something for the upmarket nature of the area in the 1930s that the rooms have fancier names than the usual public bar, saloon, etc. Pride of place goes to the two screens, which create the three rooms very much in the manner of a Victorian public house. The Sherry Bar has fielded panelling on both the walls and on the bar counter, a brick fireplace and, over it, a much yellowed picture of the eponymous castle, and attractive fixed seating. Between the Sherry Bar and Private Bar is a floor-to-ceiling screen with leaded glass panels in the top. \n\nIn order to reach the Private Bar you have to crouch to get through the door in the screen, which is only 3 feet 6 inch high. This low service door gave access to pot boys and cleaners as in the past customers would normally enter a particular bar from the street. The Private Bar is also panelled and has a baffle by the door with an iron rod attached to the top and fixed to the wall above the door. There are two sections of attractive fixed seating and the bar counter is of raked matchboard panelling. The screen between the Private Bar and the Campden Bar is only about 5 feet 6 inch high and the door in it to access the Campden Bar is only about 5 feet high. \n\nThe Campden Bar has more wood panelling, more attractive fixed seating and a bar counter with raked matchboard panelling. The mahogany bar-back is the sole survivor from the Victorian era. There is some pretty Arts and Crafts door furniture.  To the right and opened up to the Campden Bar is a further room on two levels known as \u2018The Ordinary\u2019, which may be former private quarters brought into public use at a later date, and  has few old fittings. The pub\u2019s name is said to come from the fact that on a clear day Windsor Castle could be seen from it.",

        "Pub Name": "Forester",
        "Address": "2 Leighton Road, West Ealing, W13 9EP",
        "Description": "A fine example of Edwardian suburban pub-building, erected in 1909 to designs by T. H. Nowell Parr for the Royal Brewery of Brentford. Parr provided a most distinctive piece of architecture, notable for its columned porticoes, green-glazed brickwork and prominent gables. Like Parr\u2019s Three Horseshoes, Southall, UB1, (now sadly permanently closed and converted to residential use) the Forester shows a shift away from late-Victorian glitz and glitter towards a more restrained style. In all there are four rooms. There were originally five plus the (disused) off-sales (with 1960s bar fittings) on Seaford Road, the reduction being caused by the amalgamation of the two rooms to form the public bar. There are two rooms facing Leighton Road and one of these has the remarkable distinction of possessing the only historic bell-pushes for waiter service known in a London pub. For the avoidance of doubt they even have the word \u2018BELL\u2019 above them! Apart from their rarity, they are curious in that there is a perfectly decent bar counter in this room where able-bodied drinkers might reasonably have been expected to order their drinks! \n\nThere are some fine furnishings at the Forester. The servery still has its original counter and bar-backs which display a number of Tudor arches, a favourite motif of Parr\u2019s. There are a couple of Edwardian fireplaces complete with the green tilework and in the public bar there are long-defunct remnants of gas lighting. There are also some delightful floral Art Nouveau-style stained glass panels in the windows. In the heart of the servery is an office for the publican.\n\nThere are doors in the counters for gaining access to service the beer engines in former times. The rear lounge is given over to well-regarded Thai food.\n\nHistory across the road: The allotments on the eastern side of Northfield Avenue have been there since 1832. The allotments were established next to market gardens and orchards which proliferated in this area.",

        "Pub Name": "Flying Horse",
        "Address": "6 Oxford Street, London, Fitzrovia, W1D 1AN",
        "Description": "Right by Tottenham Court Road Tube station, this is the last-remaining pub on Oxford Street. It was built in 1892/93 in a florid Flemish Renaissance style to the designs of architects Saville & Martin (who also designed the Punch Tavern, EC4) and occupies a narrow plot which no doubt reflects a long history. It was built for Baker Bros. (William Henry and Richard Baker), who epitomised the boom and bust world of late C19 public house speculation.\r\n\r\nThe pub now consists of a long, single space, which is the result of the amalgamation of two rooms from the original Victorian pub. Note there are two distinct parts to the ceiling - the front one has a modest frieze; the rear part has a tiled frieze and a skylight. Originally there would have been an entrance on the left that led to a passage to enter the rear room \u2013 note the ceiling mouldings at the front left which confirms this. The passage ran where the present bar back, bar counter and dumb waiter are situated.\r\n\r\nHead for the rear section to admire some of the most exceptional and rare Victorian pub fittings seen anywhere. The walls on three sides above the dado have carved mahogany pilastered panelling and within it is an impressive display of rare paintings; back painted mirrors; narrow panels of embossed tiling and some plain mirrors. The panelling also runs along the right hand side wall of the former front room. Just inside the front door there is the first of three back-painted mirrors; this one quite narrow and unfortunately mostly obscured by a games machine and wall-mounted TV. Then there's the first of a series of paintings which feature women representing three of the four seasons - this one is entitled \u2018Autumn\u2019 and is carrying grapes. (The fourth painting 'Winter' has disappeared, although it is just possible that it might have survived beneath the modern panelling beside the entrance). Either side of the first painting are panels of embossed tiles followed by a bevelled plain mirror.\r\n\r\nIn the rear section (formerly the rear room as indicated by the ceiling) is a panel of encaustic tiles depicting flowering urns by Millington, Wisdom and Co, Art Tile Painters of Shaftesbury Avenue. Next is the second of the canvases of the Seasons featuring plump allegorical figures, \u2018Summer\u2019, carrying pheasants, signed by Felix de Jong and Co. Then there is the second of three back-painted mirrors: this one much larger than the other two, with ribbons, cherubs and cornucopia by Jones and Firmin who reintroduced this technique for decorating glass in the 1880s. Then a large plain mirror; then the second panel of encaustic tiles depicting flowering urns, and then next is the third of the rare paintings, \u2018Spring\u2019 carrying flowers; and lastly, tucked in a recess a tall narrow plain mirror in a tiled and ceramic frame.\r\n\r\nThe rear wall is dominated by a large ornate mahogany-surround fireplace with an overmantle featuring three plain mirrors. To the left is the third of the back-painted mirrors, this being one of the pair of fairly small narrow ones and unfortunately now badly damaged.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand wall is also lined with carved mahogany panelling with large mirrored sections and small bevelled mirror sections at the top. In a recess at the rear of the left side is the fourth panel of encaustic tiles depicting flowering urns, which is in a tiled and ceramic frame. Above all of these rare features is a colourful tiled frieze with swirling foliage that runs all around the ceiling. Above the rear part of the room is an impressive large octagonal skylight with a tiled cornice; however modern coloured glass has been inserted. In the front half of the rear section there are two painted roundels depicting Classical scenes, also by de Jong. \r\n\r\nThe much altered front room part has a modern bar counter. The bar back might be old but moved back from its original position and, in a similar style to the very different frieze treatment, it is plain and with modern mirrors. The dumb waiter is modern. On the extension to the bar counter that runs into the former rear room there is a simple reproduction of a set of snob screens. On the ceiling of the former front room are another four painted roundels depicting mythological scenes by de Jong. There is some tiling on the dado of the front section of the pub.\r\n\r\nThe present window frontage is a later addition.  Downstairs, now only accessible from the rear left of the main bar, is a room now the St Giles Bar, which has a modern bar counter and bar back.\r\n\r\nThe current pub was built on the site of a pub called the Flying Horse and in 2015 it changed its name to the Flying Horse after more than a century as the Tottenham.",

        "Pub Name": "Barley Mow",
        "Address": "8 Dorset Street, London, Marylebone, W1U 6QW",
        "Description": "A tall four-storey building of 1791 which houses an interior of extraordinary interest. What is now unique is the survival of a couple of small drinking boxes attached to the counter on the left hand side held in place with a couple of cast-iron stays screwed to the wall. They are a perfect illustration of how, at the end of the nineteenth-century, pubs, especially in London, were divided up into tiny spaces for different groups and classes of people. It is claimed that these boxes here were used for pawnbroking but whether there is any justification for this seems rather questionable. This was probably a late-20th-century explanation for features which can become otherwise inexplicable with the changes in pub layout and drinking traditions. \n\nBeyond the boxes is a small room with old dado panelling and old bar counter but the pot shelf is modern. On the counter top is a very interesting feature -  worn brass plates screwed to the counter and which display the prices of liquor - evidently old with rum at 15 shillings (75p) a gallon! There is another on the counter alongside the snugs. The side walls are completely panelled and the bar counter and bar back fittings are Victorian - it is a pity that most of the lower shelves have been replaced by a couple of fridges. Note on the bar-back a tap marked 'Old Tom', an extremely popular gin, which once drew gin from an overhead barrel. The pot shelf is modern but in style with the rest of the interior. The existence of three entrances in the shop front are clear evidence that there were other internal subdivisions which have now gone.",

        "Description": "A gorgeous, small and very popular (i.e. packed) Soho pub, it was built in 1897 to designs by the architect Francis Chambers for Cannon Brewery. The exterior has glazed brick upper floors incorporating a stone carving of the animals mentioned in its name (note also the delightful mosaic of the animals at the Frith Street entrance). The ground floor has polished granite and Larvikite facings, which probably date from a 1930s makeover. The interior is also a mixture of Victorian and inter-war work \u2013 the former represented by extensive wall-tiling and a couple of large, framed advertising mirrors promoting long-vanished tobacco and mineral water products. The more restrained work of around 1930 is found in the woodwork of the left-hand part. This was also probably the time when the pub was opened up and took its present single-space layout. Its Victorian predecessor would undoubtedly have had several divisions but it is hard to work out exactly how things were. The present servery now blocks a former outside door.

        "Pub Name": "Prince Alfred",
        "Address": "5A Formosa Street, Maida Vale, W9 1EE",
        "Description": "The Prince Alfred is the best example now existing of how London pubs about 1900 were divided up into numerous separate spaces, each occupied by a particular group of individuals and social groups. The layout of many small drinking compartments is a style also seen at the Argyll Arms, Soho, London W1, Princess Louise, Holborn, London WC1 and Salisbury, Covent Garden, London WC1.\n\r\nOutside, the Prince is nothing terribly exciting \u2013 a three-storey Italianate building in keeping with its surroundings \u2013 but inside shows to perfection how late Victorian drinkers liked their pubs. The building went up in about 1865 but was given a complete refit around 1898. From outside look carefully at the exposed ceiling on the ground floor and you can see how timber and glass screen-work has been inserted, cutting across the patterned decoration. Also note the tiles and mosaic in the entrance.\n\r\nThe interior has the only peninsula-style servery to retain all of its original surrounding drinking areas \u2013 no fewer than five of them, each with its own external entrance. They are separated by timber and glass screens, all of them with a low service door for the use of, say, pot boys and cleaners. The smallest compartment has a set of snob screens \u2013 swivelling glazed panels, which gave posh patrons a sense of separation from the serving staff. Other Heritage Pubs with snob screens are Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Starting Gate, London N22;  Bunch of Grapes, London SW3;  Crown, London N1; and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but these have been moved.\n\r\nIn the middle of the servery is a wonderfully tall, carved fitment, which is secured to the ceiling by ironwork. All this late Victorian work gives the pub a delicate Rococo feel. A refit in 2001 transformed the character into a caf\u00e9-restaurant establishment with over-prominent kitchen and dining room, and totally inappropriate furnishings in the historic part: counter re-fronted at this time.",

        "Address": "93 Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, W9 1EH",
        "Description": "One of the most opulent London pubs, this spacious, stucco-fronted hotel was built in 1858. It was given a major update later in the century, probably in the 1890s, and the glorious tiled columns to the entrance porch and a huge mosaic floor bearing the name of the pub give some idea of the richness that lies on the other side of the doors. The tiles are from Craven Dunhill's Jackfield Works at Ironbridge. \r\n\r\nThe main room is on the right and has a grey marble-topped counter with unusual, bulgy pilasters and lozenge decoration. Grey marble also appears in the columns of a three-bay arcade which marches across the right-hand side of the room, embracing the generously scaled staircase to what is now the upstairs restaurant. Some of the windows have lively stained glass, while over the servery is a semi-circular canopy, decorated with Art Nouveau-style paintings of naked ladies. More such paintings, with the signature Colin Beswick 1965, appear on the back wall and are meant to evoke the unlikely story that has grown up that this was once a brothel. \r\n\r\nThe left-hand room was once clearly divided into three as the patterning in the ceiling shows. The lowest status part has matchboard wall panelling and an ornate, much decayed mirror advertising Bass pale ale. Other things to note are the attractive and unusual high-level chequerwork glazed screens, the skylight over the first-floor landing and the deep, decorative cornices on the first floor. Don't miss the Prince Alfred nearby.",

The star performer is the room in the northern part which is screened off from the corner bar by a wonderful timber and glass screen of exceptional exuberance. The grey etched parts, gilded patterns and facetted jewel-like details gleam and sparkle. CAMRA is unaware of any other pub screen like it. Then there is a bar-back of rare richness, embellished with seventeenth-century style carved wood detailing, gilded mirrors and a frieze of bas-relief apples. Finally, on the side wall come coloured tile strips and more gilded mirrors displaying foliage, hops, butterflies and birds in flight.\n\r\nThe counters are original too and are classic examples of that curious feature found in London pubs but not, apparently, elsewhere \u2013 doors to allow the servicing of the beer engines in times gone by. At the back of the pub is a large lounge with fielded dado panelling round the walls. It has a skylight over the rear part.

        "Description": "A small, unpretentious little Victorian pub now looking like the last link with tradition against a vast phalanx of out-of-town-shopping stores behind. This mid 19th century three roomed red/purple brick pub was saved from demolition in 1996 by a a vigorous locals campaign and its Grade II-listed status, the listing being the result of the pub's special character as a rare, multi-room pub. Everything around it was demolished to create car parking for the retail park beyond. Recently, a modest refurbishment has made this drinkers pub an attractive place to visit. A black and white diamond quarry tiled entrance passage from the front door leads to a lobby bar or \u2018Vault\u2019. This retains a late Victorian curved panelled bar counter, old half tongue \u2018n\u2019 groove panelled walls with original bench seating attached on both sides that has recently been re-upholstered. Some old bar back shelves were replaced in 2006 and new panelled walls and ceiling added around the servery area. Behind the servery is a stained glass window with a 'Railway Inn' black lettering on white glass panel. \r\n\r\nOn the front left the small Tap Room has a door with an etched 'Tap Room' deep etched glazed panel, it retains its Victorian fixed seating which has been recently re-upholstered, bell pushes all around the room, some old dado panelling, old tiled fireplace and service from a doorway to the left of the servery with a flap across it. On the front right is a door with a 'Bar Parlour' deep etched glazed panel and it retains a lovely late Victorian tiled, cast-iron with moulded surround and over mantle mirror, original fixed seating all around the room which has been recently re-upholstered, bell pushes in the panel above all around the room. \r\n\r\nThe pub has expanded at the rear but this does not destroy the historic core. The black and white quarry tiled passage continues to the right leading to the original \u2018outside\u2019 toilets now covered over. At the rear there is a door with a \u2018Vault\u2019 glazed panel which confuses until you know that it was brought in from another pub! This was formerly the domestic kitchen and still retains its fine stone floor. Now converted to a further small public room it contains a Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace with a mirror in the mantelpiece above. A small modern counter has been installed. Beyond this there is a further new public room in a flat roof extension to the original building which has a new tiled floor and new brick fireplace and, outside, a patio drinking area.",

        "Address": "74-80 Frances Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock, M13 9SQ",
        "Description": "Red-brick two-storey building standing alone after redevelopment of surrounding terraced housing. It was rebuilt in 1936-7 to designs of Fred Riley of Bramfield & Smith, Manchester for Tetleys Brewery of Leeds. It is a rare survival with a largely intact 1930s interior of three rooms, a drinking lobby and the rare intact counter screens; the off sales is no longer in use. There is a terrazzo tiled floor as you enter. The lobby has an intact dado of inter-war panelling, the bar counter has an original fielded panelled front and rare intact two sectioned shuttered upper section with sliding screens, a section of original fixed bench seating opposite the bar and good patterned ceiling picked out in gold on blue. Even the old bell box is still there above the hatch with \u2018Smoke Room\u2019. \u2018Ladies Room\u2019 and \u2018Bar Parlour\u2019 windows. The off-sales is situated behind the bar back and although it has been blocked up and no longer in use the area is still there and has more 1930s tiling on the dado. It is not clear how the off-sales would have worked and as the bar back sits awkwardly it does appear that it could be a replacement with its two modern \u2018Mawson Hotel\u2019 mirrors and modern tiles.\n\r\nA door with '3' on the frame on right of entrance goes into the small \u2018Brass Room (lounge) with original fixed bench seating, 1930s style panelled bar front, good shuttered upper section still with sliding window and carved wood above it and a part glazed draught screen by the door (the panel looks like a replacement). On the left near the entrance is a door with 1930s leaded panels and '2' above it leads to another small room called \u2018The Library\u2019 which has a draught screen as one enters and re-upholstered original fixed bench seating all around with a panel above it and signs of old bell pushes, also a tiled and cast fireplace. The doorway on the rear right with '4' on leads to another small room (Vault / Karaoke Room) \u2013 the only room to have lost its door. There is an inter-war panelled dado, original fixed bench seating, a door to the servery with a flap i.e. hatch service and a part glazed draught screen by the door \u2013 the glazed panel looks original. The fireplace retains its classic 1930s detailing in the wood surround but modern brick interior.\n\r\nAfter the lobby opens out for the bar area it returns to a narrow passageway to the rear still with a dado of fielded panelling. In a recess to the left around the ladies' toilets there is a dado of 1930s green tiles. The ladies' toilets have cream 1930s tiles on the walls. The gents' toilets at the end of the passage is also intact with a terrazzo tiled floor, cream-coloured inter-war tiled walls. and 4 big urinals. There is a \u20185\u2019 over the cellar door.",

        "Pub Name": "Grapes",
        "Address": "439 Liverpool Road, Peel Green, M30 7HD",
        "Description": "Impressive red brick and terracotta building by Mr Newton of Hartley, Hacking & Co for Joseph Holt Brewery with a pedimented parapet containing a shield with the date 1903. Between 1903 and 1906 the Joseph Holt Brewery built three impressive pubs in Eccles, the Grapes, the Lamb and the Royal Oak. All are magnificent examples of Edwardian architecture but the Grapes is the most spacious and the most extravagant in its use of carved mahogany, Art Nouveau tiling, Jacobean door surrounds and decorative glass. \r\n\r\nEntrance lobby with door to vault to right, ahead a full height mahogany screen with glazed panels and overlights and a door with cut and etched glass with vine designs and the words 'Grapes Hotel'. There are multiple star bursts and bevelled panels in the door and side panels in inner door. Through the door is one of the most impressive drinking passage in the UK. It has a high ceiling, a terrazzo floor, dado of green glazed tiles including some with Art Nouveau patterns which continues up the open staircase, elaborate mahogany Jacobean-style stair, elaborate bar with brilliant cut glass hatches and overlights. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the passageway is a wonderful mahogany shuttered bar with sliding screens of deep cut glass panels in a fan shape with the top section almost reaching the ceiling. The first part of the screen has, unusually, no servery beyond it, but part of the Vault indicating the counter in the Vault is a much reduced size than the original. The upper rising panels in the screen remain. Similar screen opposite the staircase also retains its rising panels where customers are served and there are two small hatches where the upper panels also survive. \r\n\r\nThe Bar Parlour on the left has a Jacobean style door surround, door with cut and etched glass with the words \"BAR PARLOUR\", original fixed seating, bell pushes, baffles by the door with stained and leaded panels in the top and tiled & carved wood surround fireplace. Between the Bar Parlour and the Smoke Room is a terrazzo floor passage with dark green tiled dado which runs from the lobby to the door on the left hand side of the building. By the door there is a hatch in the wall on the smoke room side \u2013 was this the off sales? \r\n\r\nThe rear Smoke Room has a Jacobean style door surround, door with cut and etched glass with the words \"SMOKE ROOM\u201d and grape symbols with a panel in the top\u2026\u2026\u2026. , a draught screen by the door with a stained and leaded panel in the top, another heavily carved mahogany surround fireplace with a tiled interior; the fixed seating here looks modern. In 19XX the rear wall was removed to combine it with a former private room at the rear so it is now doubled in size and has more modern fixed seating and no fireplace. \r\n\r\nAt the rear right twin doors with \u2018Billiards\u2019 and symbols and \u2018Room\u2019 and symbols with two glazed panels in the top with grapes symbols. The billiard room retains the seating on a raised platform on the exterior side and rear of the room but none either side of the impressive Jacobean style mahogany chimneypiece with pilasters with capitals and a ceramic interior and it rises to two-thirds the height of the ceiling. There are bell pushes in the panels at the end of the seating and another two along it. The end pieces of the raised fixed seating still have the makers labels \u2018Pearson & Brown Manufacturers Contractors to H M Government, Eccles New Road, Weastle, Manchester\u2019. The draught screen on the right has a stained and leaded panel in the top. A former exterior door is now the darts area. A pool table has replaced the full sized billiard one. The billiard room is served by a hatch which looks a later addition \u2013 the folding doors in it are definitely modern. \r\n\r\nThe gents\u2019 here has 1920s \u2018Gentlemen\u2019 in the door, a dado of 1920/1930s tiles in yellow and green with decorative brown and a row of narrow green tiles at the top throughout the toilets. It is situated in an early 20th century flat roofed extension at the side and rear of the building. At the end of the lobby an original mahogany arch doorway to the rear of the smoke room and a smoking shelter. There is a door to the kitchen \u2013 was this a toilet originally? \r\n\r\nOn the front right is the Vault which has seen much change. The off-sales was absorbed some years ago and has a good but disused vestibule entrance with cut and etched glass; bar counter and simple fixed seating are all modern. \r\n\r\nUpstairs is a meeting room with a \u2018Club Room\u2019 cut and etched glass panel in the door and an original tiled and carved wood surround fireplace. The small bar was added in the 1970s. The club room has a Baronial-style vaulted ceiling with exposed roof timbers and was used by the Royal and Ancient Order of Buffaloes. There is a small store room off it. \r\n\r\nThere have been some minor alterations over the years but the pub has such grandness and wealth of detail that the changes are not that apparent.",

        "Pub Name": "Lamb Hotel",
        "Address": "33 Regent Street, Eccles, M30 0BP",
        "Description": "A classic red brick and terracotta Edwardian pub of 1906 for Holt's Brewery by a Mr Newton of Hartley, Hacking & Co. The vault still has a separate entrance and a long bar counter while the remainder of the pub is served from hatches. There is a bar parlour, a lobby and serving area around the bar and an adjoining smoke room. The star here is the shuttered bar; sadly the billiard room that is in near original condition has recently lost its a full-size table. Well-preserved fittings include the elaborate Jacobean-style mahogany door surrounds and chimney pieces, Art Nouveau glazed wall tiling and curved, brilliant-cut glazed hatches and overlights and mosaic flooring. \r\n\r\nFront door leads to an entrance lobby with terrazzo floor and a dado of green tiles. Door on the right leads to the Vault which has seen changes - the outdoor department / off sales situated at the far end of the room has been absorbed. The door to it (and another door into the Vault on the same wall) have been blocked up, but the window above the door is still in place. The bar counter looks like it is an addition/ replacement - it is clearly not Edwardian but more early 1960s (possibly 1962?) - note the tiled dado in the former off sales area and how the screened area on the counter near the former door finishes short of the ceiling whereas the main original screenwork reached the ceiling! Two sets of 'Lamb Hotel' exterior windows in the Vault were smashed in 2009 and only replaced by toughened glass (say locals)!! There is an old cast iron fireplace painted brown with new tiles and the fixed seating with matchboard backs looks more 1930s or later. The 'Public bar' on the door is inter-war work. \r\n\r\nA mahogany carved screen has a door with cut and etched glazing with the words 'Lamb Hotel' and overlights which leads to the Hall / Lobby bar. On the left the entrance has 'Bar Parlour' in etched glass in the door and two substantial glazed baffles with etched panels either side of the door. The entrance to this and other rooms have elaborate Jacobean style surrounds. The room retains fixed seating with bell pushes in the panel above. The good wood surround fireplace has modern tiles but the wood surround looks original. Second on the left is another room with original fixed upholstered seating and bell pushes in panelling above and a fireplace with modern tiles and Jacobean style chimney-piece. A wide arch forms the entrance from the lobby. There are some etched exterior windows but others were lost in 2009. \r\n\r\nOn the rear right is the Billiard Room, with cut and etched glass 'Billiard Room' in the door, which until 2020 did retain its full sized snooker table. All around the room the seating on a raised platforms that been retained. The table was made by the London firm of Burroughs & Watts and was the original supplied when the Lamb first opened in 1906. The scoreboard was supplied by Rapper and Sons of Stevenson Square. \r\n\r\nWe are of a couple of Heritage pubs still with full sized billiard tables - the \r\nthe Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; and the Douglas Arms, Bethesda, North Wales. \r\n\r\nThe Hall / Lobby Bar has a dado of Art Nouveau glazed light and dark green tiles with red roses which continues up the stair well with a mahogany stair of heavy Jacobean design. Dado tiling continues to the toilets off to the rear with their 'Gents Lavatory' and 'Ladies Lavatory' etched panels. The impressive screened curved bar is of mahogany with brilliant-cut glazed hatches and overlights. There are three serving hatches with sliding windows, all kept in the upright position. The lino tiles were relaid in 2009.",

        "Pub Name": "Shakespeare",
        "Address": "1 Glynne Street, Farnworth, BL4 7DN",
        "Description": "A fine and unusually intact 1920s pub built for the 'better class' of customer. It was erected in 1926 for Magee Marshall, brewers of Bolton, on a prominent corner site though architecturally it is not particularly distinguished, presenting a rather four-square, Neo-Tudor appearance to the two roads. It is faced with large areas of whitish terracotta interspersed with red brick and, over some of the bays, are gables with touches of half-timbering. It has lost the original etched lower window panels as owners will only replace with plain ones due to the number lost but does have some leaded upper panels with 'MM' in them. The plain panels now have 'Shakespeare's Head' symbols (transfers?) on them. The splendidly ornate interior was brutally modernised in 2012 due to inappropriate treatment with paint, adding of TV screens in every room and one room permanently ready for karaoke! (our photos were taken prior to 2012). \r\n\r\nThe layout, amazingly, remains intact and the spaces are fitted out with woodwork of the highest quality making it one of the finest remaining examples of an inter-war suburban pub. The main entrance on Albert Road has solid oak doors and leads into a drinking lobby with a richly carved bar counter topped by a carved wooden shield which almost reaches the ceiling (the same shield appears over the other counters). There is likely to be a parquet floor under the carpet. It is here one finds the one real blemish in the pub - the inter-war tilework of the walls has been papered over - shame! \r\n\r\nOn the left is the Lounge which has lost its door and vestibule entrance but it does have a superb Tudor-style wood and stone fireplace with panelled overmantel, original fixed seating and there are two low baffles as you enter the room and another two by the fireplace which have all recently been painted black, The room has unusually detailed bell-pushes for waiter service also recently been painted black and above is some three-quarter height panelling that was added in the 1980s and is much plainer than the other woodwork in the pub and recently has been painted a light blue colour. This room is in use regularly for karaoke so expect the 'disco equipment'  and large speakers to be still in place. \r\n\r\nOn the front-right there is the News Room, which has lost most of its original vestibule entrance and in recent years lost its 'News Room' deep etched with gilded lettering and frosted glass panel. It now functions as the Vault and has a richly carved bar counter topped by a carved wooden shield and a red brick fireplace, which looks like a later addition, but is now blocked up and covered by a radiator. The room has a tall baffle by the door with frosted glass panels but recently painted a light blue colour, original fixed seating with a low baffle painted black and until recently it retained the original coat hooks. The three-quarter height panelling was added in the 1980s and is much plainer than the other woodwork in the pub; it has recently has been painted a light blue colour. \r\n\r\nThe back room (fronting Glynne Street) retains a rare wooden internal vestibule from the lobby area (unusual as most vestibule entrances lead from the street), but has in recent years lost a 'Commercial Room' deep etched with gilded lettering and frosted glass panel, which has been replaced by a modern 'Shakespeares Head' one. This, the best of the rooms, has another richly carved bar counter topped by a carved wooden shield and a decoratively carved fireplace with panelled overmantel, copper canopy and some modern tiling. The fixed seating is original with low carved baffles at each end recently painted black, unusually detailed bell-pushes also recently painted black and, as elsewhere, original elaborate brass door handles. The three-quarter height panelling, recently painted a light blue colour, was added in the 1980s and as well as much plainer than the other woodwork in the pub there are noticeable gaps where it meets the fireplace here.   \r\n\r\nIt is a real pleasure to find the off-sales area untouched (entrance from Glynne Street) - doors lead off it to the Vault (minus its etched and gilded panel) and Commercial Room. It has lower rising sash panels and fixed glazed panels up the ceiling. This screen forms the original bar back fitting which has shelves fixed across it. This tiny room also has richly carved bar counter topped by a carved wooden shield and has a short screen by the external door. \r\n\r\nThe last public room on the ground floor seems to have been brought into use after serving as part of the former kitchen and has modern dado panelling. Off to the left are new toilets in a flat roof extension as when built the toilets were outside - look for the black and white tiling on the way to the toilets indicating where the original exterior door lobby was situated. An open staircase with leaded window half way up leads upstairs. \r\n\r\nThe upstairs function room, with a figure '7' on an enamel disc on the door, is at present not accessible to the public. It is an excellent example of inter-war Tudor reinvention; the walls are covered with three-quarter height oak panelling, there are heavy roof timbers, a Tudor-style stone fireplace, and it still retains its quality bell pushes for waiter service. The large room has a folding screen so can be converted into two separate rooms as there are two doors from the landing and, until recently, it even retained ten circular tables from the 1920s, three of which had Formica tops added.",

        "Pub Name": "Plough",
        "Address": "927 Hyde Road, Gorton, M18 7FB",
        "Description": "The Plough is a basic drinkers pub that is intact since remodelled in 1893 and includes a central lobby with a tiled dado and one of the UK's great public bars (called 'Vault' in this part of the country). There is also a bar parlour, smoke room, pool room, all off the central hall, plus a side passage in Wellington St leading to a disused off-sales hatch, and an upstairs meeting room. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 the pub received a model refurbishment enhancing the original fittings, removing ugly 1960/70s additions, opening up fireplaces once again and adding a patio area to attract new customers \u2013 the result has been a noticeable increase in trade turning a pub considered \u2018uneconomic\u2019 to one performing very well. \r\n\r\nAt the front right is the Vault with a very richly-carved bar counter with foliated consoles including grapes motifs. The bar back is in an ornate Jacobean style with mirrors - some are replacements, and there are no changes to incorporate fridges, which are sensibly positioned to the side. In the middle bay of the bar back where the modern till is now situated look for the two coin holders that now store coin bags. In 2013 the ugly canopy / pot shelf added in the 1970s was removed so it is now possible to view the glory of the bar back fitting. The fixed seating all around the room is of the unadulterated bare bench type seen in Victorian times with match-board backs and no cushions or padding added - very rare - and at one end is an ornate lobby screen or draught screen. Note how the bench below the dart board has suffered from damage by stray arrows. The room has a ceiling of two sections with a plaster cornice and frieze with swags, a parquet floor added later. In the 1960/70s the original fireplace was removed and replaced by a radiator; in 2013 the radiator was replaced by a Victorian-style fireplace which houses a log fire in winter. \r\n\r\nInterior lobby has a black and white tiled floor and a dado of mainly green tiles. Double swing doors with decorative glazing, one with a figure '2' on it, lead to a hall with black and white mosaic floor of geometric design, and a lovely dado of dark green glazed tiles with decorative panels including floral patterns in pale blue and cream which continue up stairwell. For service to the rooms off the lobby there is a hatch with vertically hung sliding sashes (sealed in an open position many years ago), margin lights with Victorian coloured and textured glass, and a split door to the servery for staff. \r\n\r\nTo the left is a door (it did have a number '3' on it which is missing following a repainting in 2013) leading into the Bar Parlour (now called the \u2018lounge\u2019). It still retains its original fixed upholstered seating (recently re-covered) with bell-pushes above all around the room, one draught screen near the door (another has been removed in recent years), a plaster cornice and frieze with swags. The original fireplace was removed some time ago and replaced by a radiator; in 2013 the radiator was replaced in 2013 by a Victorian-style fireplace which houses a log fire in winter.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear left a door (it did have a number '4' on it which is missing following a repainting in 2013) leads to the snug (originally the Smoke Room) again with original fixed seating, bell pushes all the way around and an ornate carved draught screen by the door. The original fireplace was removed some time ago and in 2013 an inter-war fireplace from another pub was added, but it is not usable. \r\n\r\nA doorway to the rear right leads into a room clearly brought into public use in modern times and now the games room. There is a tiny hatch for service to the back of the servery, a draught screen with leaded panel in the top, which has been brought from another pub. At the end of the passage are new toilets brought inside 2004, but not affecting the historic parts. \r\n\r\nIf you take a look through the door in the corner of the public bar you will see the intact Outdoor Department or Off Sales. It has a locked entrance door on Wellington Street and a figure '8' on the inner door with a still working hatch with gas light fitting above. It has a black and white tiled floor, there is more good green tiled dado with floral panels and a sliding hatch to the side of the servery. This area is now used for storage. Note the figure '5' on the cellar door. Former first floor meeting room has original fireplaces. The side windows retain their original etched panels but the main front windows have been replaced with plain glass.",

        "Pub Name": "Nursery",
        "Address": "258 Green Lane, Heaton Norris, Stockport, SK4 2NA",
        "Description": "The Nursery was built in 1939, replacing a pub dating from the mid-nineteenth century. This is a suburban hostelry and quite genteel, situated in a delightful, quiet neighbourhood. The approach is along a narrow, cobbled cul-de-sac, reinforcing the impression of exclusivity. The pub is virtually as it was built, incorporating twentieth-century standards of comfort and convenience but with old-fashioned solid and durable standards of construction and a clean, spacious and unembellished design. There is generous use of light oak panelling. In addition to the large lounge (front left) there is a bar lobby area, a smoke room (rear centre), a vault with a separate entrance side on the left and a plain function room/dining room upstairs. \r\n\r\nThe pub has a few sporting connections. There is an immaculate bowling green at the rear accessed via double doors at the end of a passage and lining the walls are the thriving bowling club's case full of trophies and a commemorative plaque of presidents since 1917. The bowling green can be hired for bowling parties. The pub football team also has a collection of trophies and the Nursery has the distinction of having been the first headquarters of Stockport County A.F.C., when the club's ground was nearby. \r\n\r\nOn the left, car park side of the pub, the entrance has a lobby with a door in front of you which formerly led to the off-sales but this area has recently been converted to a ladies toilet serving the vault. The left door leads to the vault with a draught screen at the entrance; one wall has panelling, it retains its original counter, fixed seating and splendid 1930s tiled fireplace. Intact gents'. \r\n\r\nThe windows in all three main rooms are decorated with charming horticultural motifs such as a spade, a watering can, a pot plant, a rose, a bunch of grapes, flowers etc. The painted panels in the vault continue along the wall between the servery and the door. Look for the rows of silk glass panels along the top part of the servery in the lounge and vault with paintings of drink-related items such as a bottle and glass of wine, glasses of beer, tankard, and hand-pumps - absolutely redolent of the 1930s and are a considerable rarity. \r\n\r\nThe entrance on the right-hand side leads to a lobby bar/hall with a dado of light oak panelling, a plain original counter front and the only addition is a food bar. A doorway on the left leads to the lounge with a draught screen either side that have leaded glazed panels in the top. It has light oak full-height panelling all the way around the room. It retains the original fixed seating and bell-pushes, a plain counter front, original bar-back fitting with leaded mirror panels, a 1930s brick fireplace and the three-window bell-box is still behind the bar. Note the 1939 'Ladies Toilet' and 'Gents Toilet' hanging signs in the rear panelled passage beyond the lobby bar: the gent's toilet is unaltered (as are both loos upstairs \r\n\r\nAt the rear off to the left is the smoke room with another plain bar counter, a draught screen with a leaded glazed panel in the top section,  original fixed seating and bell-pushes all around the room. It retains its original wood surround fireplace but the tiled insert and fire are undoubtedly much later work and has a bay window overlooking the bowling green.",

        "Pub Name": "Britons Protection",
        "Address": "50 Great Bridgewater Street, Manchester, M1 5LE",
        "Description": "This pub first opened its doors in 1811 and was probably a range of houses originally. It was initially used for recruitment during the Napoleonic wars (hence the name). The building has a simple, rendered brick front, typical of Georgian times. What gives it its character now is a remodelling in the c.1930 with extensive amounts of tiling and good-quality woodwork. The moulded ceiling in the public bar and the corridor is the same as the ceiling in the public bar of the Mawson, Brunswick, a pub that was rebuilt in 1936-7 to designs of Fred Riley of Bramfield & Smith, Manchester for Tetleys Brewery of Leeds. The Britons Protection still retains its exterior Tetley illuminated sign. \r\n\r\nIt has a public bar along the front, a tiled corridor which leads round the back of the servery and to a pair of rooms behind. The public bar along the front with a figure '1' on the door has a good moulded ceiling picked out in gold on red. It retains its 1930s bar counter and bar back-fitting, a dado of 1930s tiling and fixed seating also from that date. \r\n\r\nThe off sales area is still visible with its double exterior doors - it is the area through the arch cut in the dividing wall  to the right of the public bar. The numbers on the doors were required to identify the rooms for licensing purposes. On the left are twin doors leading  to the passageway -  note the figure '2' on one of them and the five intact sliding screens on the servery side. It has a dado of 1930s tiling and another moulded ceiling picked out in gold on red. There is hatch for service at the rear of the servery which has two leaded screens and serves the two rear rooms. \r\n\r\nThe Smoke Room at the rear of the passageway has a figure '3' on the door,  original fixed seating with bell pushes, a copper fireplace with wood surround from the 1930s and by the door a draught screen with a leaded glazed panel in the top. There is a figure '4' on the last room on the rear right which has a draught screen with glazed leaded panel in the top, leaded rear window, original fixed seating and bell pushes, 1930s wood surround fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe tiling continues all along the passage which runs to the toilets at the rear and up the staircase. Note the ladies toilet has an unusual hanging door with leaded glass panels in the top.  A visit (if possible!) is recommended to the gents' with its 1930s massive urinals and 1930s tiled walls. There is also a room upstairs with few old fittings which is available for meetings.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the pubs double centenary there was a celebration on 10th & 11th June 2011 when the first 200 customers each day could buy a pint for only 10p.",

        "Pub Name": "Circus Tavern",
        "Address": "86 Portland Street, Manchester, M1 4GX",
        "Description": "This is one of the Top Ten Heritage Pubs in Britain which, despite its narrow internal dimensions, retains its room divisions and its modest fittings. An utterly unspoilt pub which is a tremendous survival in bustling central Manchester. Such survivals are rare nationally, and are especially uncommon in metropolitan surroundings. This early nineteenth-century stuccoed building is just one bay wide and was originally a house converted to a public house. It has a corridor on the left leading to two simply-fitted public rooms, one behind the other, on the right, which are separated by a vertically-boarded partition, the rear section which has a glazed upper section. It is packed if there are 40 customers so don't be surprised if, occasionally, you find the front door closed to avoid a crush! \r\n\r\nIn the corridor the tiny servery is placed under the stairs and is only large enough for one person to perform the noble act of serving the beer. The details of the servery with its glazed superstructure suggest it dates from c. 1930 date. A doorway leads to the very small room at the front which retains fixed bench seating, but a pair of draught screens by the door have recently been removed and the fireplace is a replacement. \r\n\r\nThe rear tiny room, also created by a partition wall to the corridor, retains its original fixed seating with bell pushes all around the room, a draught screen by the door, rear etched window, just two tables, but the a tiled and cast iron fireplace is a modern replacement and the glazed panel above the doorway and the wood with the figure '3', a requirement of the licensing magistrates, has recently been removed. The Gents has a 1930s 'Gents' glass panel on the door - the ladies was outside but is now covered over. Our photographs are now out of date as the walls of the whole place covered in photographs. There is no food, no piped music, no fruit machine and certainly no pool table - a TV is switched on for sport.",

        "Pub Name": "Hare & Hounds",
        "Address": "46 Shudehill, Manchester, M4 4AA",
        "Description": "The building itself dates back to about 1800. What makes this pub distinctive is a remodelling that took place about 1925 when the bluey-brown ceramic front on the ground floor was put on. The interior is exceptionally complete - such a complete survival of this period is rare nationally and all the more so in a city centre location. On the left the entrance leads to a through-corridor which expands in the middle of the pub to form a drinking lobby in front of the servery. There are two public rooms, one at the front and one at the rear. All the woodwork is of c.1925. The corridor running from the front door in Shudehill to the rear entrance in Salmon Street is faced to half height with dark brown mottled and plain brown tiling from the inter-war period (of the same style of tiles appears at the Britons Protection, Manchester) where the remodelling was clearly done at much the same time. \r\n\r\nThe interior porches serving the front and rear entrances at either end of the corridor are lined with grey-green and cream coloured tiling. The front entrance lobby has half-glazed double doors leading to the corridor. The front bar ('Vaults') has a figure '1' on the door with a glazed upper panel and there is dark brown mottled and plain brown tiling on the partition wall that backs on to the drinking lobby and another section of tiling on the opposite wall. It has a bar counter with a plain panelled front and supports a glazed superstructure modelled to resemble sash windows with c.1925 decorative leaded glazing; and also fixed seating from that date. \r\n\r\nThe central drinking lobby has a plain counter with hatches above it and leaded glazed panels above, all from c.1925. The only things missing are the lower screens, but you can still see the pulleys that used to operate them. The c.1925 mirrored bar back-fitting remains intact. The rear room with the figure '3' on the door with a glazed upper panel retains its original fixed seating (re-upholstered in 2016 following water damage), bell pushes, a good tiled, cast and wood surround fireplace from c.1925 and a bar counter with a plain panelled front, hatches and leaded glazed panels above.",

        "Pub Name": "Peveril of the Peak",
        "Address": "127 Great Bridgewater Street, Manchester, M1 5JQ",
        "Description": "This pub is an amazing sight. There are a number of pubs (especially in Birmingham) where interior walls are covered in tiles, but here the display is outside. This simple, two-storey mid-Victorian building was remodelled about 1900 and given a ceramic facing. One the ground floor it is yellowy-green, and above the orange name band it is cream. The fascia wording of 'Peveril Of The Peak' on two sides and 'Wines & Spirits' on the end of the building were covered by Wilsons Brewery standard signage until removed in the 1980s. The internal porches on both sides have fancy flanking tile bands of red, cream and green and good timber and glazed detailing. The interior has three rooms and a dog-leg corridor which also serves as a drinking lobby. \r\n\r\nThe drinking corridor is lined with dado of green and cream tiles, both plain and embossed. The west side of corridor is defined by timber and glazed screen forming the back to server with stained glass in upper parts with florid Art Nouveau detailing and serving hatches below. Bar counter has fielded panels and pilasters. The most impressive room is the one fronting Great Bridgewater Street. Through a doorway with a draught screen either side is a small wedge-shaped room with c.1900 fixed seating, bell pushes in the panel above and a Victorian tiled and cast iron fireplace. Similar bar counter with fielded panels and pilasters. In c.1982 Wilsons Brewery added the pot shelf - a stained and leaded screen over the bar counter in the public bar - take a close look and you can see it was carefully crafted to match the stained and leaded panels in the lobby bar. There is a 'Public Bar' etched window in the door. \r\n\r\nThe rear Lounge has old fixed seating and bell pushes. The Smoke Room has fixed seating, bell pushes and elaborate Victorian marble surround and tiled, cast iron fireplace. There is a tiled dado on the walls leading to the toilets. Three episodes of the TV Detective series 'Cracker' were filmed here and every time ITV show a repeat landlady Nancy Swannick (the back of her head appears) receives a cheque for \u00a375 and her son Thomas who was filmed handing over a pint of beer - only his hand appears - also gets a cheque for \u00a375!! In 2011 Nancy Swanick celebrated 40 years behind the bar.",

        "Address": "52 Cross Street, Manchester, M2 7AR",
        "Description": "A tall, narrow building dated 1901 in the gable. It's a typical example of exuberant end-of-the-nineteenth-century architecture - in this case in an ornate Jacobean style. The front part has red brick and terracotta while the rear is all faced in buff terracotta. Over half of this magnificent tiled interior is operated as a high class restaurant www.tomschophouse.com. The interior consists of four spaces, one behind the other, the middle two defined by a wide, green-tiled arch. These two areas are characterised by an impressive display of tilework, with a green dado running round the walls and cream tiling above extending to ceiling. A black and white tiled flooring runs throughout the whole of the pub. The two restaurant areas each have 2 arches in right-hand wall. All arches lined with green tiling and one houses a large wine rack. \r\n\r\nIn the front section is a modern bar counter and back-fitting but there is some good linen-fold panelling. Through a doorway  is another modern counter and there is a small modern counter in the restaurant section. In the rear small area, also defined by a green-tiled arch, is an excellent ceramic fireplace. There is an outside seating area at the rear of the building - table service operates lunchtimes in the outside seating area (and possibly at other times).",

        "Address": "73 Rochdale Road, Collyhurst, Manchester, M4 4HY",
        "Description": "A very special pub with an impressive exterior and even more impressive interior. It was built in 1888 to designs by local architects Darbyshire and Smith. The ground floor is faced with polished granite and has the unusual feature of some Gothic detailing; unusual because Gothic was usually associated with churches and therefore rarely used for pubs. The interior consists of one long narrow room with a noticeable slope down to the servery. \r\n\r\nThe room has a splendid mainly blue and cream colourful mosaic floor but you will notice a large area of red quarry tiles - this was originally the site of a long bar counter which was removed in 1989. In its place is a small counter with green tiled panels along it. All the walls of the room are lined with glazed bricks of various shades of yellow, cream and greens. There is a wonderful frieze around the room with the wording 'Ale Porter (covered) Whiskies Gin Brandies Cordials Wines Gin Rum Ale Porter (over main door) Brandies Whiskies Rum Brandies Cordials'. The room is topped off by a ceiling of glazed bricks in a number of segments each with a centrepiece of four tiles in relief which create a ceiling rose. The ceiling is held up by iron girders and a number of ceramic supports. \r\n\r\nThere is a good marble and carved wood surround fireplace but it looks modern and the fixed seating is of no great age. Three front doors indicate the room was originally sub divided. In the lobby of the third door is another mosaic floor. There is a number of stained and leaded panels above the entrance door. Modern vestibule entrance. At the rear down a L-shaped passage is a modern small dining room brought into use in recent years. At the rear of the property is the Marble Brewery.",

        "Pub Name": "Cemetery Hotel",
        "Address": "470 Bury Road, Rochdale, OL11 5EU",
        "Description": "This ominously-named corner pub takes its name from the nearby cemetery - nothing more worrying than that! It was built in the later nineteenth and given a face-lift a little late, probably in the Edwardian years. From the front door there is an inner porch with \u2018Cemetery Hotel\u2019 mosaic floor and a dado of rich vibrant various shades of green with cream tiling up to the ceiling finished off with a row of green tiles at cornice level. The dado of rich vibrant various shades of green continues throughout the lobby and into the drinking lobby in front of the servery. The tiling on the wall opposite the servery has been suffered from some movement to the property. Within the tiling are very decorative tiled panels of shades of green and orange. The bar back appears modern, but the bar counter could be old, if not Edwardian, and was painted over in black in 2020. \r\n\r\nThere are three rooms. The most impressive of the three rooms is the front left Parlour with \u20182\u2019 on the door. It is expensively fitted and includes very good seating, which was repainted back in 2020. There are four seating areas created by substantial part glazed mahogany draught screens with classical columns. Either side of the entrance door are two imposing mahogany draught screens with leaded glass panels in the top part. The room has a distinctive turquoise tiled/ceramic fireplace (which is showing signs of wear) with a good wood surround including a mirror. The room has retained an original etched front window with the wording \u2018Wines & Spirits\u2019 but the two side windows are poor replacements for the original \u2018Crown Ales\u2019 and \u2018Cemetery Hotel\u2019 etched windows lost in recent years. \r\n\r\nThe small pool room on the front right with a \u20181\u2019 on the door is by comparison extremely plain with a wood block floor, bare fixed seating  all around the room where the back panels were replaced in 2020 and all wooden surfaces painted a blue-grey colour.  The room still retains its original \u2018Crown Ales\u2019 front window and there is a range fireplace, which normally indicates the room was formerly a kitchen, and would pre-date the Edwardian refit. The small snug on the rear left has \u20183\u2019 on the door, retains old fixed seating with a draught screen (all repainted black in 2020) but it has lost its fireplace and the windows are poor replacements of the original \u2018Crown Ales\u2019 and \u2018Wines & Spirits\u2019 etched ones. There is a (modern) hatch for service to the side of the servery.",

        "Description": "Built in 1913 for the Rochdale & Manor brewery, the Coach & Horses is a remarkably intact multi-room pub. The plan resembles pubs like The Stork in Birkenhead or the Prince Alfred in Liverpool in that the Public Bar ('Vault') is sited in the right-hand angle of the building and is surrounded by a corridor of which rooms lead to the left and rear. Front door internal porch has a black and white mosaic floor including the name \u2018Coach & Horses\u2019 and a dado of green tiles on both sides. The inner original doors have \u2018Coach &\u2019 \u2018Horses\u2019 deep etched and frosted panels with door protectors in front. The side door from the car park also has an internal porch with a black and white mosaic floor including the name \u2018Coach & Horses\u2019 and a dado of green tiles on the right hand side.  \r\n\r\nOn the left is the door with \u2018Outdoor Depmnt\u2019 highlighted in gold in a deep etched and frosted panel and door protectors either side. This tiny narrow room has a black and white diamond quarry tiled floor, a bare bench and three sections of the impressive timber and glass screen. Here the lower sections are still intact. This remarkable survivor is usually locked and sadly now used for storage. The inner original doors here have \u2018Coach & Horses\u2019 deep etched and frosted panels with door protectors in front. A corridor runs between the two doors with has a black and white diamond quarry tiled floor \u2013 can you spot the one small sizes tile? Apart from the left hand wall from the front door there is a dado of mainly green tiles all around it and also up the staircase to private quarters. Look for the deliberate mistake in the tiling at the foot of the stairs \u2013 one tile has been turned upside down! Service in the corridor is through an impressive timber and glass screen, as at the Birkenhead and Liverpool pubs (the sashes, sadly, have been removed from the lower sections here). \r\n\r\nThe Lounge on the front left of the corridor retains its original fixed seating with bell pushes but the fireplace has been changed. Front left room has the only significant change \u2013 what was probably a double doorway entrance is now much smaller and a short modern screen has been added in the north end of the doorway in recent years, but the original door frame has been retained i.e. the modern panel could be removed. The Vault on the front right has a door with a deep etched and frosted panel and door protectors either side, and another three sections of the timber and glass screen (again, sadly, without the lower sections). The fixed seating with draught screens have been retained but the fireplace has been removed and replaced by a dado of wood panelling (there are original fireplaces remaining upstairs). At the rear right off the corridor is the small Smoke Room with \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 picked out in gold in a deep etched and frosted panel and door protectors either side but no other old fittings.",

        "Description": "This is a marvellous institution - one of the last-remaining, truly traditional railway buffet in the country. It was part of the 1885 rebuilding at the station and consists of a conservatory and high ceilinged main part of the buffet within the brick-built station buildings. In the latter there's a long, straight, marble-topped counter with three tall narrow Victorian bar back fittings of shelving on the back wall. has a Victorian stone, tiled and cast-iron fireplace, some original fixed seating on the platform side and lots of railway memorabilia. On the right hand side of the counter is the traditional glass fronted snacks/confectionery display. \r\n\r\nTo the right is a bare boarded passage leading to two rooms brought into public use as part of the buffet. The first is a narrow room with the toilets on the rear wall and a small bar counter which looks like it was added in 1970s. The extreme right-hand high ceilinged room was originally the first-class ladies' waiting room and has a good cornice and ceiling rose. Lots more railway memorabilia on the walls of the two rooms.\r\n\r\nThe Redfern family ran the place for well over 20 years. When the last owners took over they undertook a restoration which won the CAMRA/English Heritage refurbishment award in 1998. There is always a seriously interesting range of real ales on offer. Also, you can buy a North West dish called 'black peas' - made from the black pea, an older variety of the plain pea. Long soaked overnight and then boiled, they are traditionally eaten from a cup with salt and vinegar. \r\n\r\nIn the 70s the local Environmental Health Department demanded that the marble bar top and many other traditional features should be torn out and replaced with Formica. After quite a struggle with much attendant publicity the owners won the right to keep the existing (and perfectly hygienic) fittings as they are",

On Chatham Street side is a disused door with a 'Order Dept.' etched window that was the former off-sales. This is still intact retaining its counter front with window panels up to the ceiling with a hatch for service, tiled floor, but is now used for storage and only accessible by a secret panel at the base of the bar back fitting. \r\n\r\nThe external lobby has a tiled dado and mosaic floor and through the inner door in a painted wooden screen is the lobby bar. This has a splendid dado of green and cream glazed tiles with multi-coloured Art-Nouveau motifs in coloured glass and a floor of marble mosaic recently exposed having been covered by carpet for many years. The tiled dado continues up the stairs and there is an impressive coloured glass window on the half landing. \r\n\r\nThe servery has a fine curved original mahogany bar front but the lower panels of the screened servery were removed at least 20 years ago. The bar back fitting was replaced in c.1980 and covers up the off sales hatch - locals say the original bar back fitting was sold by a previous landlord! A low suspended ceiling of light slatted wood was added above the entire servery area about 20 years ago. A room leads off each corner of the hall and all have painted wooden door surrounds with segmental pediments and doors with etched glass panels. \r\n\r\nAt the front left is the basic tap room with an etched 'Tap Room' panel in the door and the figure '4' above - a requirement of licensing magistrates. It retains original fixed bench seating around the room, two lobby screens with leaded glass in the top and an original tiled and wood surround fireplace recently brought back into use. The servery in the tap room originally consisted of rising shutters, which were removed in c.1980. The smoke room on the front right has an etched 'Smoke Room' panel in the door and the figure '3' above, two lobby screens with coloured leaded glass panels in the top, an original marble and tiled fireplace, original fixed seating with bell pushes above. \r\n \r\nThe bar parlour on the rear left has an etched 'Bar Parlour' panel in the door and the figure '1' above, two lobby screens with coloured glass panels in the top, original fixed seating with bell pushes above, an original glazed red brick and wood surround fireplace and mirror in the mantelpiece above and a number of etched and leaded glass windows. Service is from a door to the side of the servery with a flap across it and a figure '6' above it. The commercial room on the rear right is more modest than the others with an etched 'Commercial Room' panel in the door and the only old fitting being a wood surround fireplace which has a modern tiled interior. At the rear is the ladies toilet which is a conversion from living accommodation. \r\n\r\nA short corridor running parallel to the stairs now with its uncovered mosaic floor leads to the billiard room situated in a single storey wing on the right side of the pub. It has a vestibule entrance and etched 'Billiards Room' panel in the inner door with the figure '5' above. It has exposed roof timbers, painted glass skylight, a disused good tiled and wood surround fireplace now blocked up, a bay window with two etched windows and two plain windows which have replaced 'Billiards Room' ones and three rear windows with decorative etched panels.

        "Pub Name": "Arden Arms",
        "Address": "23 Millgate, Stockport, SK1 2LX",
        "Description": "One of the great survivors amongst Britain's Heritage Pubs, the Arden Arms has a snug called 'the Select' which is believed to be one of only three surviving public rooms that can only be accessed by walking though the servery i.e. the licensees part of the pub so you have to ask staff for permission to use the room. This tiny room has an etched 'Arden Arms' window, original fixed bench seating around it with bell pushes from the days of table service. Modern items such as a fridge and a coffee machine have been added in recent years! The other two rooms where you can sit while the staff serve customers from the same space are the 'Inner Sanctum' at the Bridge, Topsham, Devon and the \u2018Snug\u2019 at Ye Horns Inn, Goosnagh, Lancashire. \r\n\r\nThe Arden Arms is a three storey building of red brick built in c.1815 and owned by the Raffald family until sold to Robinsons Brewery in 1889. The 1st landlord George Raffald was the nephew of Elizabeth Raffald, author of \"The Experienced Housekeeper\" and compiler of Manchester's first trade directory. Doors on Millgate and Corporation Street lead into a L-shaped drinking lobby with a black and white quarry tiled floor and featuring a floor to ceiling screened bar still retaining its rising sashes. All four on the lobby side are intact but are no longer raised/lowered. In 2021 the bar counter front and doorway to the servery was painted a blue-green colour; also some new tiling added to the bar back. There is a good frieze around the walls of the lobby rand an open staircase. The lobby entrance on the Corporation Street side has a terrazzo floor. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the pub is the Millgate Room - a two-part room with a red and black diamond quarry tiled floor and a folding partition that can create two separate rooms. The door nearest the front of the pub with a figure '6' on it is no longer in use, the door in use has a figure '1' painted on it. The front part of the Millgate Room has a good 'Arden Arms' etched window, fixed bare bench seating around the room with loose cushions, a draught screen by the door and a fireplace with an old wood surround but modern cast-iron interior and a coal fire. The rear part has a cast-iron fireplace also with a coal fire. \r\n\r\nIn the angle of the streets is the vaults with a figure '2' on the door, original fixed bench seating around most of the room, and two 'Arden Arms' etched windows. The screened bar here retains its two top sections but the lower panels are missing and the room has lost its fireplace. Look for the rare 'bell tables' - in most pubs you used to summon table service by pressing a bell push on the walls of a room but here some tables had a bell push located in the centre of it to attract the attention of the staff - nowadays they are not responded to! Note the splendid grandfather clock and that the handpumps are, unusually, affixed to the bar back fitting of shelves rather than on the counter - there are very few remaining examples of this.",

        "Pub Name": "Queens Head",
        "Address": "12 Little Underbank, Stockport, SK1 1JT",
        "Description": "Turners Vaults Wine merchants were established in 1764 but built into Underbank bridge in 1868 and has an underground labyrinth of wine caves over 300 years old. Like the Circus Tavern in Manchester it is extremely narrow and shows how many small urban pubs must have looked a hundred years ago. The interior was remodelled about 1930 and consists of three rooms and appears to be little altered. The extreme narrowness of the interior led to some rearrangement of some of the internal woodwork in the early 1990s but this was carried out with care by Samuel Smiths and the pub still retains an authentic feel. \r\n\r\nYou can see the changes to the front bar by taking a look at the photos of the original untouched interior on the walls. They show the bar was smaller as there was originally a passage from the front door to the rear and a partition wall closer to the counter with old bench attached to it. The original counter remains but the photo on the wall show it originally went all the way to the front window so Sam Smiths have carefully shortened the servery by turning a section of the counter through 90 decrees. In place of simple bar back shelving there are now two curved areas forming the bar back fitting with modern 'Samuel Smiths' and 'Queens Head' mirrors, new tiles and wood to attach optics; the third 'curved area' at the front is now part of a cosy corner of the public bar. The fixed seating at the front is part original (on the right) and part a copy by Sam Smiths, but it is difficult to spot the difference. A part glazed partition wall separates the front door lobby from the public bar. \r\n\r\nOn the top of the bar counter (a replacement top) are two sets of spirit cocks. Until 1935 they dispensed spirits stored in the rooms above the pub when it was a Wine Merchants business. A photo on the wall shows that a third set existed hidden behind the counter in the front now removed part. These are rare survivals in pubs - CAMRA is only aware of four other sets of spirit cocks at Shipman's, Northampton; Haunch of Venison, Salisbury, Wiltshire; Bull, Paisley, Scotland; and Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland - all CAMRA Heritage Pubs. \r\n\r\nPhotos on the wall show that the counter originally abutted the partition at the rear of the public bar so part of the counter at the rear has been turned through 90 decrees (or is modern work?). Also, photos show that attached to the surviving five section partition and set at an angle there was a small section of two panels wide that has clearly been removed. Finally, the entrance to the public bar was via the doorway at the rear of the room. Just short of the rear door to the public bar is a recess formed by two short partitions - this housed a fruit machine until Sam Smith's implemented a policy of no electronic machines in their pubs, which also saw the removal of TV's (even in guest rooms of their pubs offering accommodation!). \r\n\r\nBeyond the public bar is the 'horse box' snug created by three partition walls, two with upper section of glazed panels, with U-shaped fixed bench seating attached around a tiny table and lit by a skylight. This snug is thought to have been the meeting place of the first trade unionists. It has enough room to seat just six people and boasts an original hat rail. At the rear a doorway leads to another small room with fixed benches down both sides, a cast iron fireplace (modern?) at the end and the whole room is covered by a skylight with two sections of cornice work. Also, there is 'Compacto' what might be the smallest gents\u2019 in the world but no longer in use!",

        "Description": "A plain corner-site pub with a remarkably intact interior refitted probably in the 1920s. A lobby with a tiled dado leads into a large drinking lobby also with a tiled dado. The centre-piece of the pub is the servery which has still-working etched rising sash screens and a tile-fronted counter in buff, blue-grey and a few multi-coloured patterned tiles. A door on the front left leads into the vault with four sections of the screened servery, the two on the left being curved, there is a 1920s tiled and wood surround fireplace and original fixed seating. Note the old gas water heater for hot toddy's. A disused central door has 'vault' etched panel and recently a new door was added on the far left to give access to the modernised toilets. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is the so-called \u2018ugly\u2019 room with another two sections of screened server, a fine but disused tiled and wood surround fireplace and more original fixed seating. On the right of the drinking lobby is the small 'John Hyde Suite' named after a former local which retains original fixed benches that have been refurbished. In this room, the \u2018ugly\u2019 room and, unusually, in the vaults there are bell pushes for table service which operated right up to the 1970s. There is an opened-up darts room on the rear right which has been completely refitted, and a 'Gentlemen' etched panel in the door to the gents'. There is quite a good selection of original 'White Lion' etched glass windows all around the pub.",

        "Pub Name": "Harrow",
        "Address": "Harrow Lane, Steep, GU32 2DA",
        "Description": "A great unspoilt but hard-to-find pub just east of Bedales School and part of a tile-hung terrace. In the Dodd / McCutcheon family since 1932 with present owners sisters Claire & Nisa (granddaughters of Arthur & Annie May Dodd) having spent their entire lives here initially helping their grandmother in the kitchen. Their mother, Ellen McCutcheon, died in 2004 and her obituary appeared in the Daily Telegraph and also newspapers in Canada and New Zealand. The family bought the pub from Whitbread in 1991. \r\n\r\nIt has two splendid, little-altered rustic bars with venerable old fittings. The two bars (public left, smoking room right) measure only about 12 ft x 12 ft each. A brick path leads to the public bar door with its latch door. The public bar has a brick floor by the door, red & black quarry-tiled floor and full height tongue and grove panelling. There is a massive inglenook fireplace with log fire and old fireback. Seating consists of basic wall benches on two sides, short benches near the servery, also logs for seats. \r\n\r\nService is through a hatch with two doors held back permanently and behind there are no optics, no bottles of lager but one long wooden stillage (carefully renovated and raised three inches in 2008/9) full of casks of real ale. The bar back consists of shelves added to the panelling on the rear wall that replaced some older ones in the 1980s. The small atmospheric drinking space means that once the diners have moved on and the drinkers dominate you are soon brought into conversation with the locals. Ask to see 'The Book of Harrow Quotes and Wise Sayings'. On the tables in the public bar there are bowls of walnuts etc., also a nut cracker and you can help your self! \r\n\r\nThe equally small second room on the right still retains its original name plate 'Smoking Room' and alongside it a modern 'No Smoking' sign to comply with recent legislation! Through the latch door you will find a carpet and lino floored room with a collection of stuffed animals, an old Polyphon and a picture of the royal family dated 1880. It has an old tongue and groove dado which runs across the hatch, assorted seating includes a pew and two corner benches, and there is a Victorian tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those rare pubs to still have an outside (and partly open-air) Gents', the ladies' are also outside and both are situated some 15 yards across the lane in front of the pub. Whitbread, supported by East Hampshire Council, devised a plan to integrate the two bars for the purpose of providing indoor lavatories, an arrangement which local health officials deemed unhygienic. Ellen McCutcheon was supported by the customers with hundreds writing letters making it the highest number of objections the local planning office had ever received! \r\n\r\nThere is lots of seating outside including some under a short veranda making the Harrow very popular in sunny weather. Major emphasis on local beers with at least two available. Home-cooked food cooked on a traditional Rayburn cooker with the hearty Harrow pea and ham soup a speciality. There is no electronic till, no TV, no piped music, no TV, and no pool table. Tens of thousands of pounds have been raised for local and national charities. Outside you will see plants for sale and inside \u2018The Harrow Cook Book\u2019, containing lots of recipes compiled by the locals is available for \u00a310.",

        "Pub Name": "Sun Inn",
        "Address": "Rosemary Lane, Leintwardine, SY7 0LP",
        "Description": "A stone and brick built cottage pub some 200 years old and was until recently described as possibly the most unspoilt pub in the country. Four small rooms with some public use and service still like it has been for over 60 years. In fact it is like how hundreds of pubs operated in the past. \r\n\r\nYou entered into a small lobby with a basic bench down one side and a table. On the left is the bar-parlour that doubled as Flossie\u2019s living room with a carpet, 1950s tiled fireplace, half panelled walls, a dresser, sideboard and armchairs. \r\n\r\nTo the right of the lobby is a larger room which has much more of a public bar character and is called the 'red brick bar' with a red-tiled floor; a number of low basic benches all round; scrubbed tables and a solitary clicking clock above a brick fireplace from the 1930s - no alterations for years. \r\n\r\nYou could sit here and order your beer (very few other drinks were sold) which was fetched from the \"kitchen\" on the far left, where the beer is stillaged, and brought to you. In the final years of Miss Lane's ownership you were more likely to find it was one of a band of locals rather that served you. At quiet times the pub can still operate in the old traditional way. \r\n\r\nIn April 2011 a new bar was added at the rear in a large extension. The original rooms remain with the lobby (minus its bench and table) now providing access to the new room and modern toilets beyond. For service to the original rooms you stand at the hatch to the cellar and ring the bell. \r\n\r\nThe following details on how the Sun was saved is taken from an article that appeared in the Beer on the Wye Festival programme: \nTHE SUN INN, LEINTWARDINE \u2013 A SIGN OF HOPE FOR OUR PUBS?\r\nProof that active campaigning does work. \r\n \r\nIt was in danger of not just being the end of an era, but the end of one of Britain\u2019s most remarkable pubs. What followed the death of England\u2019s longest-serving landlady, Flossie Lane, back in June 2009, is an example of what can be achieved through positive campaigning. Back on Saturday the 13th June, 2009, the world learned the very sad news that Florence \u2018Flossie\u2019 Lane, a remarkable landlady who ran the wonderfully unspoilt Sun Inn at Leintwardine, had passed away in Leominster Community Hospital following a short illness. Flossie managed significant obituaries in both The Times and the Daily Telegraph and featured on the BBC Radio 4 obituary programme, Last Word - the latter with contributions from both Jeremy Paxman and Herefordshire CAMRA member, Mark Haslam. \r\n\r\nBack in the late summer of 2009 the future of the Sun Inn was cast into doubt when it was due to go to auction with a guide price of up to \u00a3300,000. Although mention was made in the auction sales particulars of the pub\u2019s special history and circumstances, CAMRA was concerned that this price, and further mention of \u2018development potential\u2019 in the auction sales particulars, meant its sale might attract interest from property speculators who would have had no interest in running it as pub. Consequently a campaign was set up by Herefordshire CAMRA to publicise the threat, and hundreds quickly signed up to support a viable future for the Sun Inn on a \u2018Save the Sun\u2019 website. \nBBC visit \r\n\r\nThe campaign and plight of the pub seemed to catch the public imagination. Major articles appeared in both The Times and the Daily Mail, and on the 29th July BBC Midlands Today paid a visit. Mark Haslam recalls the visit of the BBC: \u201cFlossie famously always forbade all photography in the Sun - it was one of her strict rules. Therefore, on the day the BBC visited it did seem incongruous to be sat in the small red-brick bar with the TV cameras rolling and a digital editing suite parked outside topped-off with an enormous satellite dish. But I think Flossie would have forgiven all concerned, especially as she would have realised it was all helping the fight to secure the pub\u2019s long term future. \r\n\r\nThe visit of the BBC seemed to be the watershed of the campaign. Shortly after their visit we learned that the sale at auction had been postponed indefinitely, and this then allowed a two-man local consortium (who had been waiting patiently in the wings) to make their move. \nConsortium buy pub \r\n\r\nIt was soon public knowledge that the consortium consisted of Hobson\u2019s Nick Davis, and Sun Inn regular, Gary Seymour. They only had one thing in mind for the pub \u2013 and that was to see it continue as it had for the previous 200 years. The pub finally changed hands on the 6th November 2009, and shortly after Mark Haslam was back on TV, this time in a feature on BBC Breakfast Time. It reported the good news that the Sun Inn was saved. Nick and Gary, the owners, are keen to expand and develop the beer offer by enlarging the kitchen stillage, and see the Sun Inn being very much a community-based pub, but definitely without a ubiquitous pub dining operation. Nick and Gary also believe maintaining the original rooms intact and untouched is essential to keeping the pub\u2019s atmosphere and, although plans are now well-advanced to build an extension onto the rear of the premises, they realise protecting its historical legacy is vital to their business plan. Even the old Victorian garden is retained, with the idea being to have the local school tend the vegetable patches complete with wonderful old glass frames and mature fruit trees. \r\n\r\nMark Haslam, who led the successful \u2018Save the Sun\u2019 campaign, adds: \u201cWe never doubted for a moment that those who inherited the Sun Inn from Flossie were sincere with their wish to see it continue as a pub, if it were at all humanly possible. Therefore, this outcome appears to be a \u2018win-win\u2019 situation \u2013 the owners got a fair price, and the village secures the future of the Sun Inn as a pub. It is simply too important a part of our national heritage for us to have allowed it to have just faded away.\u201d \nTalk is cheap \r\n\r\nBefore the Save the Sun campaign started, there were clarion  voices that \u201cwe were wasting our time\u201d and that the Sun Inn was doomed. Thankfully, we were not deterred from our campaign by such Cassandras. Talk is cheap, and action is not for everyone. The successful outcome of the Sun Inn shows that campaigning DOES WORK. Never give up and you never quite know where you might end up. Following the campaign at the Sun, and following a number of other successful pub campaigns, Mark Haslam was awarded \u2018CAMRA Campaigner of the Year\u2019 at the CAMRA AGM held in the Isle of Man back in April 2010. There is now even greater reason to celebrate at the pub\u2019s annual beer festival, which again will be held on the August Bank Holiday Sunday. \r\n\r\nA blue plaque has been installed by Herefordshire CAMRA: \"FLOSSIE - FLORENCE LANE - 1914-2009 - LIVED IN AND RULED THIS PARLOUR PUB\".",

        "Description": "A 400-year-old building with a farmhouse pub.  It has been in the same family ownership since 1911 when the present landlady's grandfather took over. The centenary was celebrated on 11 April 2011 with events, special beermats and also a commemorative bottled beer by Hereford Brewery. The interior is little changed since before WWII and consists of three rooms. \r\n\r\nThe small public bar has a small counter where the frontage is a continuation of the tongue and groove dado panelling and there is also a hatch to the right. The bar-back consists of old shelves and includes two tiny drawers, one of which is a very traditional till. There is a splendid curved high backed settle around the fireplace, which could date from just before WWII. there is some bare bench window seating around the local pub game of quoits - note the ancient wooden score board on the wall. On the right is the small darts room with a Victorian tiled fireplace, lovely corner bench and its own hatch. \r\n\r\nOn the left is the lounge with a figure '6' on the back of the door. It was added to the public rooms just before WWII and has the feel of a domestic sitting room of a country house. Previously it was a kitchen and the brewhouse and water was drawn from a well directly below. The present fireplace replaced the old range fireplace of the former kitchen. The bar fittings appear to date from post-war rather than pre-war with a ply panelled counter front and the mirrored bar back fitting has some Formica as well as wooden shelves. A curtain covers the entrance to the servery for staff and on display are various items of breweriana including a Watneys Red Barrel. The splendid grandfather clock by G Rocke of Kidderminster was a wedding present for the landlady's great great grandmother in the 1980's. \r\n\r\nPlease note the opening hours are only 11.30 (12 Sunday) to 14.45 and 19.00 to 23.00.",

It was purpose-built by William Longley of Pound House on land purchased in 1841, the name commemorating the Queen\u2019s Royal West Kent Regiment. The pub has one of the last remaining totally unspoilt rural public bars (on the right) dating from the Victorian era and which, apart from the paintwork, has been almost untouched since the end of the nineteenth century.\n\r\nThe front door leads to a tiny lobby with doors left and right and another in front that leads to the private quarters. On the right-hand door with the figure '1' leads to the tiny public bar with its original panelled counter with decorative brackets. The black mastic around the base of the bar counter is the position of the spittoon trough. The three Dalex handpumps, dated 1948, can still dispense exactly half a pint of beer with one pull: prior to their installation beer was fetched by jug from the cellar. There is simple shelving, basic bare benches in the window recess and a two-sided bench. The brickwork around the fireplace probably dates from 1953.\n\r\nThe saloon bar on the left with '2' on the door was originally a very small room that in 1953 was increased to twice its size by combining with a previous private room. It retains its original curved Victorian panelled counter with decorative brackets all painted bright yellow. The rear straight section is a later addition, no doubt of 1953? This very spartan room has a bell-push and a sign saying 'please ring for service'; old fireplace; and a ticking clock. At the rear an extension added in 1953 contains the ladies'. The present inside gents' (public bar) replaced outside ones in 1953.\n\r\nA sign on the outside of the pub warns customers 'Lager not sold here' and there is no ice and no children's room! There is no till - just a small bowl for coins with notes placed beneath. Crisps are stored in tins \u2013 all crisps were supplied in tins up to the 1950s and two have been retained \u2013 you can just about make out \u2018crisps\u2019 on one and \u2018cheeselets\u2019 on the other! Note the old Bisset dart scorer - three finger-operated metal dials that change the score.\n\r\nThe saloon bar is venue for monthly folk music sessions (ring 01732 862862 or 01737 248708 for details) - it has a few chairs and the odd table placed around the edge of it.",

        "Description": "Built 1905 by Alfred Nuttall (unclear if he was the architect or developer, though) \u2013 a near-complete example of an early 20th-century public house. The layout is of a lobby bar area and five small rooms retaining the majority of their original fittings and doors with the room names in Art Nouveau etched panels. \r\n\r\nThe inner porch has a terrazzo floor, Art Nouveau tiles in cream and florid blue, and in the internal glazed screen is a door where the original 'Victoria Hotel' etched and frosted panel has, sadly, been replaced by a plain one. The whole of the lobby bar area has floor-to-ceiling Art Nouveau mainly green tiles as does the passageway and up the staircase to private quarters. At the top there is a frieze of three rows of tiles - two of green on yellow petals and the top one featuring a sheaf of wheat. Carpet now covers the terrazzo floor of the lobby bar area. \r\n\r\nThe bar counter has a tiled front and a complete set of screens above all the way around which still retain the lower panels that can move up and down. The rising panels have Art Nouveau cut glass panels in them. There are two original bar-back fittings, one of two bays and another of one bay, situated opposite each other at the end of the servery. The only significant change to the layout has occurred in the front right area which is now accessed via a wide doorway. Originally there was a jug and bottle department - see the  'Jug Department'  door re-sited to the ladies': similarly the 'Smoke Room' door has been re-sited to the gents'. \r\n\r\nThe front left small room door has a pedimental surround and 'Commercial Room' etched glass panel. It has a wood block floor, slatted wooden original fixed bench seating, wood panelled ceiling but has lost its fireplace. Next on the left is another small room with a pedimental surround and 'Parlour' etched glass panel. There is a good decoratively carved baffle/lobby screen as you enter, original fixed bench seating all around, and original Art Nouveaux tiled and cast-iron fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe third room on the left has has a door with a pedimental surround and on it an etched glass panel 'Public Kitchen'. The unusual name could refer to a place where families with poor kitchen facilities could have meals cooked. It has a herringbone tiled floor, slatted wooden original fixed bench seating, and an Edwardian tiled, cast-iron and red painted wood surround fireplace. Look up the open staircase and you will see a stained and leaded window at the top of the stairs. At the end of a tiled passage is a room recently brought into use in which has has an inter-war wood surround fireplace with modern tiles, dado panelling and 'Private\u2019 etched panel in the top of the door. \r\n\r\nThe last small room is on the rear right and has a door with a pedimented surround and on it an etched glass panel inscribed 'Bar Parlour'. It has a good baffle by the door and original fixed bench seating with carved bench-ends featuring pine cone and husk designs. There is a good Edwardian green glazed brick and wood surround fireplace with a mirror in a mantelpiece. Opposite this room the servery has a door for staff with a 'Bar' etched panel in the top. Another passage with tiled walls runs down the rear of the servery to the door leading to the former bowling green. The pub is known locally as the 'Butcher Brig' after a now defunct slaughterhouse and an adjacent railway bridge. \r\n\r\nIn recent years the pub has seen an increase in trade following the arrival of licensee Jean Baxter and its success is partly due to her introducing a regularly changing range of real ales from micro breweries.",

        "Address": "166 Friargate, Preston, PR1 2EJ",
        "Description": "An ornate three storey building with a balcony right in the heart of Preston and which served originally as a small hotel. It dates from 1898 and was built for Kay's Atlas Brewery of Manchester to the designs of local architect, J A Seward. It is a stone and red-brick building typical of its time. The hotel function explains the fact that the drinking areas are very well-appointed and thus a far cry from basic street corner locals which would have proliferated in the inner suburbs. There was a 'Market Room' at the rear when built in 1898 and in 1929 this was replaced by the present U-shaped seating area and indoor ladies and gents toilets accessed via corridors situated to the left and right side of it respectively. There have been few changes since. \r\n\r\nThe Friargate fa\u00e7ade has a central elliptical-headed doorway with moulded stone surround and very large brackets featuring stone carvings of male and female figures carrying a balustraded balcony above. The Black Horse Hotel mosaic floor in the Friargate entrance and \u2018Black Horse\u2019 deep etched glass in the inner door is a taste of what\u2019s inside. A mosaic floored passage leading to the heart of the pub centred round the servery. There are two small smoke rooms, one each side of the corridor, and to the right is the public bar originally accessed via the Orchard Street entrance.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar has a wonderful ceramic semi-circular bar counter, possibly by Pilkingtons, in graceful cream and light green with bulging pilasters, decorative brackets and a wooden top and is one of only 14 ceramic bar counters left in the country. Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Burlingtons bar at the Town House, St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant.\r\n\r\nWithin the servery is a modest U-shaped bar back fitting which was installed in c.1995 and has modern additions such as fridges. The walls of the public bar have a tiled dado of light brown plain tiles, red and light blue decorative tiled panels and a brown, cream and blue ceramic row above. There is a splendid ceramic fireplace in mainly brown with Fleur de Lys symbols in relief and a mirror in a wood surround above. This small room has a mosaic floor and good segmented plaster ceiling. There is a vestibule entrance from Orchard Street with mosaic floor, a tiled dado as elsewhere, and the inner door & side panels have colourful stained and leaded glass panels. \r\n\r\nIn c1995 an archway was cut between the corridor and the public bar accessing it to the rest of the pub. There is a further door in Lothian Street, off the right hand side Orchard Street which has 'Hotel Entrance' in the top panel. This was also used by customers of the public bar to originally access the toilets at the rear by going outside the Orchard Street door and back into the pub by the Lothian Street / Hotel Entrance door.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nAt the end of a Victorian terrace, this is a largely unaltered, traditional drinkers' pub. The layout is characteristically northern - as you enter (through doors with the initials MBB for Massey's Burnley Brewery) you come into a drinking lobby in front of the serving area slightly to the right. There are three other rooms which are accessed from the lobby, all of which retain their bell-pushes for table service which were certainly working in 2004 and may still do so. \n\nThe bell-box with its indicators still survives in the lobby. At the front left is the commercial room (with Victorian fixed seating) and on the right the tap room. The most impressive room is the smoke room, found at the rear off the tiled corridor which leads right from the lobby. It has a fine wood and glazed screen between it and the servery with a door and flap for service. It also has an upholstered fixed bench, etched windows and is, in all, a splendid survivor. The plan and much of the fittings seem Victorian but there is also an interwar imprint, e.g. the tiled fireplace in the tap room and tiling and plasterwork decoration in the friezes.",

The exterior is quite notable with its rounded corner, original lettering, black glazed plinth and door framing, and tile-work patterns. Inside the plan is intact with multiple rooms arranged in a complex plan. A precious survivor is the off-sales area entered from the side street (door now locked). On entry the service hatch is straight ahead and there is a bench to sit: doors lead off to the flanking rooms. Public bar at the front. Drinking lobby left. Typical 1930s counter fronts. Much original tiling in the loos. If you look carefully you will see that the lobby and the rear room leading off the off-sales area used to have vertical sashes to give some privacy (see the recesses for the sashes at the sides of the servery openings).",

        "Pub Name": "Three Horseshoes",
        "Address": "11 Leicester Road, Whitwick, LE67 5GN",
        "Description": "This completely unspoilt local in a former coal-mining village was a beerhouse in the mid-19th century. Formerly in the hands of the Burton/Callaghan family since 1909 and was\u00a0nicknamed 'Polly's', after the former landlady's grandmother. The present tenant took over in June 2022 and has carried out a very sympathetic refurbishment.\u00a0 The 1882 date on the frontage probably may indicate alterations that turned it into the present structure. In the tiny inner lobby, which is more like a vestibule with part-glazed partition walls, the off-sales hatch with its diminutive sash windows is still in use today (although only occasionally). The public bar is through the latch door to the left which has a '1' on the inside - a requirement of licensing magistrates in the past to number pub rooms. The public bar has been this size since the building was converted to pub use as the red quarry-tiled floor and the extensive bench seating straddle 'the join' of two rooms in the former cottages. Original fittings include the low bar counter, bar-back shelves and wood surround fireplaces at the front left and rear right with rows of glazed bricks. Note the baffle at the end of the seating near the exit door to outside toilets. The only change seems to be the boxing-in of the seating in the later 20th century towards the rear. The only modern item is the piano which is played for the occasional sing-song. To the right of the lobby is the tiny snug with a bare wooden floor, another Victorian fireplace with rows of tiles down each side and basic bench seating. Service is from a hatch to the back of the bar servery. There are three tables with Formica tops well worn from the regular playing of dominoes on them. This room is now used mainly for special occasions but a polite request at the bar will allow a viewing. Outside gents' and ladies' toilets.",

        "Pub Name": "Stork Hotel",
        "Address": "41-43 Price Street, Birkenhead, CH41 6JN",
        "Description": "A mid 19th century public house, given a high-quality remodelling in c.1903. This is a fine pub and one to compare with other excellent Heritage pubs on Merseyside - the Lion; and Prince Arthur; in Liverpool and the\r\nEdinburgh; in Crosby. All these pubs are on street corners with the public bar occupying the angle and surrounded by an L-shaped corridor. In all cases there is a rich display of Edwardian tilework as well as fine woodwork. \r\n \r\nIn the re-modelling the exterior received a glazed brick and tile frontage on the ground floor which includes colourful blue pilasters - note a little mosaic apron in front of the main entrance on Price Street. The inner lobby has a door with etched \u2018Bar\u2019 in a full height partition featuring both etched and stained & leaded glazed panes. The L-shaped corridor has a splendid mosaic floor which was revealed in 2000 for the first time in decades and this has much enhanced the appearance of the pub. All around the corridor on both the servery side and other walls is a dado of turquoise blue tiles, many with Art Nouveau patterns in yellow, orange and light blue. The choice of blue tiling was down to the owners, Threlfalls Brewery, whose house colour was blue and the tiles are by George Swift Ltd of the Swan Tile Works, Liverpool.  \r\n \r\nA curved screen forms the bar back fitting and has a doorway for the staff with a flap across it for service, also a doorway now covered by glass, which may have been the off sales. There are five but originally there was six as the two near the Price Street entrance has been amalgamated by removal of the upright between them and the upper and lower windows removed. The other sections of various sizes are intact with four of them still retaining their rising sash windows \u2013 two always in the upper position, two always closed. Many windows have decoratively etched glazed panels, three separate panes in the case of upper windows, topped off by a row of stained and leaded windows all around. \r\n \r\nThere is a splendid original fireplace in the corridor with mahogany surround including two pillars, a brown glazed brick interior, but modern interior. In the angle of the corridor is a section of curved fixed seating with carved bench ends and bell pushes in the panelling above. Behind the seating there are three original \u2018Stork Hotel\u2019 etched glass windows in which the patterning is far more sinuous than usual (you can see something of this in our picture). The mosaic-floored passageway with mainly blue tiled dado continues to the toilets at the rear and the tiling continues up the staircase to the first floor. The gents\u2019 has walls completely covered in inter-war tiles, old black and white tiled floor, and there is four inter-war urinals. The ladies' has modern tiles. There is another broken pediment above the doorway to the passage to the toilets. On the first floor is a large former function room with elaborate cornice.  \r\n \r\nThe corridor between the angle and the door on Adelphi Street is a drinking passage with some tables. Near the Adelphi Street entrance is the News Room with its original door leading off the corridor (just as it does at the Lion); with a \u2018News Room\u2019 etched panel. It retains original fixed seating with carved bench ends, bell pushes in a wood panel above, an Edwardian tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace, three \u2018Stork Hotel\u2019 etched and frosted exterior windows with leaded lights above. On the left of the Price Street entrance is the Bar Parlour, entered through a doorway with impressive surround including a mahogany broken pediment. Formerly sub-divided, the fixed seating looks like it has been there for some time and there is one stone Tudor shaped fireplace (date? \u2013it looks modern) and a disused chimney breast.  \r\n \r\nThe Public Bar has doors from both lobbies and still retains its Edwardian tiled dado of mainly dark brown with some light brown ceramic banding above. The bar counter is modern (1970\u2019s?) and there is a modern pot shelf above. There are two good Threlfall\u2019s Salford Ales\u2019 etched windows and the corner door has been blocked up so the public bar may have been divided some time in the past. The screen described above forms the bar back.",

        "Pub Name": "Lion Tavern",
        "Address": "67 Moorfields, Liverpool, City Centre, L2 2BP",
        "Description": "A very fine pub in central Liverpool which is one to compare with other excellent Heritage pubs on Merseyside - the Stork;in Birkenhead, the Prince Arthur; in Liverpool and the Edinburgh; in Crosby \r\n\r\nLike them it is a Victorian building (in this case of c.1865) re-modelled about in the early 20th century. They all share corner sites with the public bar occupying the angle and surrounded by an L-shaped corridor. All too have beautiful tiled dados in their corridors dating from Edwardian re-modelling schemes (as seen in our picture). A further similarity is the way the corridor works to provide a drinking area. \r\n\r\nDiscovery of the documents submitted to the licensing justices enabled former licensee, John O\u2019Dowd, to trace the evolution of the pub to its present form. Back in 1903 a plan shows the public bar laid out as it is now. There was a snug behind it in the heart of the building and left of this, and on the site of the present toilets, a public room labelled \u2018parlour\u2019. Then in 1915 the Lion expanded by taking in the building next door at 28 Tithebarn Street also a licensed premises. This enabled the L-shaped corridor to be created round the public bar and the formation of two rooms behind this - a news room in the newly acquired area (the name still survives in the window glass) and a lounge where the skylight is today. Then in 1967, when pubs everywhere were being opened up, plans were drawn up to remove the walls to the corridor from these rooms. These were duly implemented and the corner entrance was blocked. (hence the pub does not merit entry in the Part One of the National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. In 1979 they added glazed partitions, one outside the gents and one on the right as you enter the news room. \r\n\r\nThe porch on Moorfields side has mosaic floor and one tiled wall from floor to ceiling. The old looking vestibule entrances at each end of the public bar / passage are modern dating from 1967 - note how they do not match the mosaic floor in the entrances. The Public Bar has a panelled Victorian bar counter with consoles and match strikers on counter front, and glazed bar back with etched glass, shelves and pedimented opening for access by staff. Note how the fridges have been carefully positioned under the counter and no part of the bar back fitting removed, as frequently happens with bar fittings both historic and modern. The  L-shaped room has a bare wooden floor, tiled walls in green with a floral design and basic bench seating. \r\n\r\nThe Lion has a splendid set of elaborately carved window screens situated in the lower part of the front windows with multi glazed panels and a large central etched window. Often seen in Scotland, there are few examples in England. There are three on the Moorfields side the first of which advertises 'Old Highland Whisky', a smaller 'Falstaff Ale' one and a plain glass one i.e. original panel is lost. On Titheburn Street side are ones advertising 'Walker's Scotch 167 Whisky', and beyond the entrance a 'News Room' one in gold on a frosted and etched window. Note the handles on the window screens so you can left them up to clean the windows themselves. \r\n\r\nThe L-shaped corridor has a tiled dado with Art Nouveau detailing and above is a timber and etched glass screen with sashes, a number of which are in the raised position for service to drinkers in the corridor and the two small rooms off. The first small opened-up room to the right of the corridor is the News Room with a mosaic floor, a match striker above upholstered fixed seating, and an old copper and wood surround fireplace with large bevelled mirror above. The bell pushes in this room which were used to summon up drinks are still in working order but are currently switched off. A news room is believed to be so called because in bygone days newspapers were relatively expensive so would be left around for poorer customers to read. The small Lounge at the rear is another opened-up area with a colourful glazed dome, another old copper and wood surround fireplace with large bevelled plain mirror above, old fixed seating and bell-pushes all around. \nThe Lion's Name & Inn Sign Reproduced from CAMRA's Merseyale February 2011 \r\n\r\nThe Lion is not named after the King of the Jungle but rather a world famous Liverpool locomotive which operated the Liverpool to Manchester railway, the first inter-city passenger railway in the world. The Lion LMR 57 was one of two 0-4-2 locos built in 1838, the other loco was named Tiger to haul freight on the LMR. The locomotive came to world attention when it starred as the Titfield Thunderbolt, the 1953 Ealing Studios film of the same name. In 1930 the Lion commemorated the 100th Anniversary of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway by steaming on a short length of specially laid line at the Mystery in Wavertee Playground alongside the LMS Liverpool to London line. In 1979 Lion was again centre stage commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Rainhill Trials. It starred in the grand cavalcade of trains, later steaming to Steamport at Southport for public display and short runs. \r\n\r\nLion is owned by the Museums of Merseyside and is one of the major exhibits (alongside a Liverpool Overhead Railway carriage) at the recently opened Museum of Liverpool, Pier Head. The pub sign had weathered badly and in 2009 MerseyAle designer Dennis Jones digitally renovated the sign for the previous licensee John O\u2019Dowd, but the sign was never printed. Surprisingly given the imminent return of the Lion to Liverpool Museum, new licensees Sean and Mike decided to change the sign from the image of the locomotive to a plain design with the pub name.",

Currently boarded up and plans to turn it into a Chinese Cultural Centre being considered. This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028 The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work in 2012 took place.  \u2028\n\nJust beyond the massive archway entrance to the Chinatown area there is a pub that since 1940 has been known as the Chinese Local \u2013 see the plaque naming it as such pinned to its front wall. Following a change of leaseholder the tatty exterior has been repainted \u2013 it is reputed that last orders is said in English and Cantonese? Until 2009 this was an amazingly unaltered Victorian street-corner pub, retaining its public bar, two snugs and a further large room and while the layout remains the one hundred-year-old bar back has now been replaced by a modern one. The two snugs are sandwiched in between the servery and Nelson Street, and, unusually, the public bar turns its face away from the main street. It has an early twentieth century counter with a Formica top from the 1960s, there is an elegant fireplace that seems Edwardian or of the 1920s, and has old fixed seating. \n\nThe largest room spans the width of the building, and has bell pushes for table service, old fixed seating, another 1920's tiled and wood surround fireplace and there is a large hatch from the servery. At front of pub on the left are two tiny snugs with just doorway entrances - the left one is L-shaped with red leatherette fixed bench seating, bell push and is served from a small window to the back of the servery. Second snug has a U-shaped red leatherette fixed bench seating, a bell push, door and flap to back of the bar. Look for the jockeys jacket of Persian War, winner of the Champion Hurdle in 19XX.

        "Pub Name": "Peter Kavanagh's",
        "Address": "2-6 Egerton St, Liverpool, City Centre, L8 7LY",
        "Description": "This unique pub interior is the result of a refitting in eccentric fashion in 1929 by Peter Kavanagh. The layout is a typical northern one of a drinking lobby with rooms at the front and rear of the building \u2013 both are served from doorways to the servery and have remained virtually unaltered. Situated at the end of a terrace of houses dating from 1840, the pub, originally 2 Egerton Street, was rebuilt in c.1877 and has a cream and burgundy tiled fa\u00e7ade added in c.1920. In 1927 the Rialto ballroom complex opened close by and with no alcohol on sale it led to an increase in trade for the pub. In 1929 Peter Kavanagh was able to buy the pub on a 99 year lease from Liverpool council and then drew up plans for exterior and interior alterations to the pub. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, 4 Egerton Street was added initially as a beer store and then in 1964 altered into a new lounge bar with a servery being installed; also new ladies and gents toilets were added. The pub was carefully extended into 6 Egerton Street in 1977 when the lounge bar servery was removed to insert a staircase giving access to the new trading area. All the later alterations have not impacted on the 1929 scheme. Peter Kavanagh was licensee from 1897 until his death in 1950 and at 53 years service this makes him one of the longest serving licensees in the country. He was also a successful businessman, designer and alderman. \r\n\r\nThe exterior and interior lobbies have mosaic floors. From the front door a passage leads to the centrally placed public bar with fielded panelled bar front with a copper top, leaded glass windows behind the servery but covered up by mirrors, a large collection of nick-nacks hanging around the bar and from the ceiling, just bar stools and no tables. In the two snugs are colourful leaded windows installed by craftsman William English, who also installed large stained-glass windows in Worcester Cathedral. There are a set of four attractive windows in the rear room \u2013 the first is of an 18th-century coach and horses; then the coat of arms of Oxford University, coat of arms of Cambridge University, and finally one of Stephenson\u2019s famous steam locomotive \u2018Rocket\u2019. In the bay window of the front room are three stained and leaded windows \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019, \u2018Galleon in full sail\u2019 and \u2018Crossed Oars\u2019 being a reminder of Liverpool\u2019s seafaring links. \r\n\r\nBoth snugs have curved wood panelled walls with original 1929 fixed seating and above are original paintings by Eric Robinson (a Scottish artist) that date back to 1929 and a shelf and up to the ceiling are curved stained and leaded glass panels at the top. In a frame on the wall is what appears to be a pub myth \u201cit states that he ran up a beer bill on a slate but couldn't pay it to Peter Kavanagh and said he would paint the pub. It says Kavanagh expected a lick of paint but got two fascinating murals of scenes from Pickwick Papers instead! However, the truth is that Peter Kavanagh commissioned Scottish painter Eric Robinson to complete two murals \u2013 one based on scenes from Dickens for the front room and another based on the work of Hogarth for the rear room. The eleven feet long one in the front \u2018Pickwick Room\u2019 is a variation on a scene from Pickwick Papers and the thirteen feet wide one encapsulating several scenes, all of which depict some form of drinking and merriment and has led to the name of \u2018Hogarth Room\u2019. Also in the front room is a mural being a variation of the Tony Weller ejects Mr Stiggins scene from \u2018The Posthumous papers of The Pickwick Club\u2019 and two other murals situated either side of the fireplace. A door at each end of the servery provides service to drinkers in each snug. Also, more 1929 fixed seating under the exterior windows. \r\n\r\nThroughout the pub are a number of hand-carved oak woodwork such as some 28 corbels as extra supports for the shelves, four beautiful oak wood panels depicting drinking scenes in the eighteenth century situated either side of the two fireplaces of glazed brick with oak wood surrounds; small faces carved on the door jams of the bar placed above service bells; and figure heads supporting the shelves on the upper parts of the fireplaces; six carved heads on the end of the bench arms which are believed to be a caricature of Peter Kavanagh. A lot of this work is said to have been done by craftsmen working on Liverpool\u2019s Anglian cathedral, on which work started in 1904. \r\n\r\nPeter Kavanagh patented many inventions including in 1924 a table with a twist-lock mechanism that allowed for the quick positioning or removal of tables and seating from floors in theatres, shops, hotels and ships. Then in 1938 he designed a superior version with more features. These included an ashtray below a latticed circular shaped grill set into the centre of the table beneath which lies a metal bowl filled with water to extinguish lighted cigarette ends pushed through. The table top is hinged so can be lifted up to allows access to the water filled bowl for emptying. There is an amply sized shelf below, then further down there is a set of electric bell pushes (now defunct) for table service, which continued into the 1960s; and towards the bottom of the column are two revolving cups to hold lighted pipes or cigars. Several hundred of these tables are said to have been manufactured by a local firm and twelve of them grace the two snugs. It is said that similar ones were in use on the SS Lusitania \u2013 with the ashtray incorporated below a grill which can collect spilt ale they are ideal for a rough transatlantic crossing! Kavanagh also patented three legged stools and chairs with an adjustable front leg to solve the problem of rocking on uneven floors but sadly none remain. \r\n\r\nThe plans of 1929 show a new gents toilet at the rear (now a cleaning cupboard), a telephone booth and a ladies toilet built in the basement. The walls of the (now disused) ladies\u2019 and the stairway down to it were lined with a material called \u2018Nicolite\u2019, which is made of glass but the appearance of marble. The steps and the floor of the ladies\u2019 was of terrazzo. The pub was originally the Grapes and known for many years by locals as Peter Kavanagh\u2019s so it was no surprise when it was renamed in his honour in 1978. The present licensee Rita Smith has carried out some restoration such as the removal of black paint added to the oak carvings which was added to them in 1976. \r\n\r\nA book about the book \u2018Peter Kavanagh\u2019s A 150 year history of a Liverpool pub\u2019 was written by Patrick A Kavanagh in 2000 (Walton Press Ltd.) and much of the details in this description have come from the book.",

        "Address": "36 Hope Street, Liverpool, City Centre, L1 9BX",
        "Description": "Quite simply this is the most spectacular pub in England - indeed, throughout the whole of the UK and it is only matched by the Crown in Belfast. Situated halfway between Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral and Metropolitan catholic cathedral, this is a \u2018cathedral\u2019 among pubs. It was rebuilt in 1898-1900 to designs by Walter Thomas for Liverpool brewer, Robert Cain. Thomas and Cains went on to build the other prodigy pub of central Liverpool, the Vines. Craftsmen and artists from the then University Department of Architecture & Applied Art worked on it under the superintendence of G. Hall Neale and Arthur Stratton. \r\n\r\nThe exterior is a freely-treated Tudor style designed to resemble a Scottish castle with all sorts of odd details including stepped gables; turrets; balustraded parapet, oriel windows and a stone sculpture of musicians and musical instruments in low relief and a marble fa\u00e7ade. One of the most stunning features are the entrance gates to Hope Street; they are an amazing display of Art Nouveau wrought iron and copper gates by H. Bloomfield Bare which carry the motto and arms of the original Robert Cain brewery. The interior, which is what everyone comes to experience, has an unusual, complex plan. \nTour of the pub \r\n\r\nBeyond the grand gates is a large northern drinking lobby, for stand-up drinking, with a mosaic floor in front of a bar counter also encrusted with mosaic and a wooden top. There are a number of heavily carved and polished mahogany partitions, Corinthian pilasters and columns, and a wonderful intricate plasterwork high ceiling with decorative cornice. To the left is the former off sales that was accessed by a door on the left of the lobby and it has a mosaic floor and tiled walls of cream and green topped with brown strips. There is another mosaic bar front, the original bar back has stained and leaded and decorative stained glass panels, and partitions have deep etched and frosted panels. Note the \u2018H\u2019 on the partition in this area \u2013 most rooms in the UK have numbers for licensing magistrates purposes but, unusually, a number of pubs in Liverpool have letters. \r\n\r\nGo down a step into a carpeted area which was a small private bar with more tiles on the walls, deep etched windows, and a bar counter with squared panelled front and a copper top. Above you is a wonderful stained and leaded screen going all the way across the pub with its coat of arms in over 20 panels. The ceiling section here is very decorative with a deep relief cornice. \r\n\r\nGo under a wooden 'arch' which was added in the 1970s and you are in the last area on the front left part of the pub - the lounge bar - which retains a strip of tiles i.e. many have been removed. There are a number of acid etched and deep etched windows and a marble window sill. The L-shaped bar counter with a copper top was taken back to increase the drinking area in 2004. The modest original bar back/gantry here has lovely etched panels.  The front room finishes with a splendid decorative wooden partition with etched panels. Note the letter \u2018A\u2019 on the door in the screen on the passage side. Behind the bar on the left is a glazed-in Publican\u2019s Offices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large porch on Hardman Street has a mosaic floor, tiled walls to half/two-thirds height and etching in two door panels on the doors. The passage here has a mosaic floor and splendid tiling on walls to dado height. The ladies' toilets here were not added until the late 1940s. Round the servery curves a  splendid decorative screen with deep etched and frosted panels \u2013 note the letter \u2018C\u2019 on a button - more tiled walls and vestibule with stained and leaded panels including coats of arms. A disabled toilet has been added in recent years. A staircase leads to the former 'Philharmonic Dining Rooms'. \r\n\r\nA door with acid etched panels leads back into the lobby where you will find a truly splendid large inglenook fireplace with a marble and wood surround and large bevelled circular mirror above with stained glass windows of Kitchener, Baden-Powell and Lord Roberts to underline its date \u2013 the 'Baden Powell' etc. names were painted on in the 1990s. The fixed seating either side of the fireplace appears to be a later addition as it covers part of the mosaic floor awkwardly. Around the fireplace are three copper panels on the back wall, four copper panels on the right of musicians and another two on the left. The very good original bar back has lots of stained and leaded and decorative stained glass panels. \r\n\r\nThe original gents' loos are all part of the essential sightseeing. There was a sign in the passage that read  \"Ladies - do not enter Gents toilets in order to provide privacy for our male customers please ask staff to check before you enter\" but recently replaced with one inaccurately claiming the toilets are the only Grade 1 listed ones in the country \u2013 the truth is the pub is Grade II* listed and that includes the toilets! The door has two deep etched panels and inside are the original 1890's Rouge Royale by Twyfords five red marble urinals and three luxurious washbasins and glinting mosaic floor and original gleaming brass fittings, coloured tiles in relief on the walls and oblong bevelled mirror in tiled surround - also a porcelain and mosaic panel under the 'flushing unit' (Adamant cistern). The WC looks like an afterthought - look at the mosaic floor and mosaic on the wall \u2013 in the billiard room there is a disused door to the toilets which appears to have been blocked up to add the WC. In the passage near the toilets the vestibule covering the last bit of mosaic floor looks like a later addition. \r\n\r\nThe second best example of gents' lavatorial elegance can be seen at the Princess Louise, Holborn, London WC1.\r\n\r\nFrom the lobby a corridor leads to the former billiard room and there are rooms either side at the start of the passage originally the smoke room and the news room (they are now rather stupidly called Brahms and Liszt). On the left the former smoke room has good etched glass panels in the door, decorative wood panelled walls, marble effect (i.e. new) fireplace with good wood surround, good decorative plaster ceiling, stained and leaded windows at top on rear and on the passage side, bell pushes (don't work), good cornice - note the letter 'E' on the door (not a number). \r\n\r\nOn the right the news room has a splendid stained glass window depicting St Cecilia, patroness of music, and the inscription 'Music is the Universal Language of Mankind' and has illustrations of a harp and trumpet. The room is totally totally panelled in mahogany with a door having two deep etched panels, an old decorative wood surround fireplace with new interior and old good wood surround above and oblong bevelled mirror and bell pushes. Note the letter 'D' on the door. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the mosaic floor corridor is a cavernous hall called the Grande Lounge that was originally built as a billiard room. It takes up nearly 50% of the trading area on the ground floor which shows just how important billiards was in the c.1900 pub. It has copper panels of Liverpool area scenes such as New Brighton seafront by German-American designer H. Bloomfield Bare and Thomas Hudson. There are two colourful stained and leaded glazed roof lights and one with a new plaster covering (was glazed) where there is new staff accommodation above. It has sumptuous deep friezes with plaster caryatids, thistle designs & sculptured naked boy supporting ceiling by sculptor Charles Allen The ornate ceiling is picked out in gold. \r\n\r\nThe sheer scale and richness of decoration attest to the importance that billiards had in end-of-the-nineteenth-century pubs (there is another impressive billiard room at the Vines). As elsewhere in the pub there is superb mahogany joinery all around the room. A splendid marble and decorative carved wood surround fireplace with four columns in wood surround above and a bevelled oblong mirror. Excellent stained and leaded mullioned outside windows. Now the Grand Lounge, it was transformed into a smart restaurant by Bass in 2000 and at one time (1960s?) had its own (modern) servery where there are no copper panels and modern panelling is situated near the fireplace. \r\n\r\nUpstairs is a two-part Dining Room with modern bar fittings and a reproduction Victorian tiled fireplace in the smaller area.",

        "Pub Name": "Vines",
        "Address": "81 Lime Street, Liverpool, City Centre, L1 1JQ",
        "Description": "The Vines, built in 1907, is, like its sister pub, the rather earlier Philharmonic, one of the great show pubs of the country. Both were the work of the local architect, Walter Thomas for the brewer, Robert Cain. It is named after Albert B. Vines who first opened a public house on this site in 1867. No back-street, working man's local this - it was built as an up-market place of refreshment for those who prospered from Liverpool's role as a one of the great commercial centres of the Empire. The exterior of this imposing three storey building has been described rightly as 'a strange and original amalgam, with elements of baroque, steep gables and a jaunty domed tower'. The impressive clock that extends over Lime Street (which has been claimed to be the biggest free standing in Great Britain?) is by E J Dent & Co. the same company that provided the clock tower at the Houses of Parliament building that contains 'Big Ben'. Staff can go up to wind up the clock. Polished granite / marble exterior and polished granite in two porches on Lime Street side with multi-glazed doors and a RSC (Cains) mosaic floor. \r\n\r\nThe splendid interior is a tremendous display of mahogany, oak panelling, rich plasterwork and a big stained glass dome. Of particular note are the fireplaces, set back-to-back in the lounge bar and smoke room. The public bar on the right has a high ceiling with ornate plasterwork decoration, a modern tiled and old carved wood surround fireplace and Edwardian upholstered bench seating. In order to enlarge the customer area the servery in the big front room was cut back in changes in 1989 and the original bar counter is now less than half its original size and a small parlour/snug was lost. Note how the ornate bar back extends across nearly the whole of the rear wall and is topped off by a large clock which was originally in the middle of the servery. You now walk underneath it to get to the modern toilets at the rear, the original Edwardian WC\u2019s having been lost in the 1989 changes. A new food service bar has been added in recent years \u2013 originally there was a small snug behind this area. A fine glazed screen with floral designs separates the public bar from the lounge on the left. In the passageway at the rear to the lounge bar are some bar fittings re-sited in 1989. Originally this was a lobby bar with service from hatches in the screen that formed the bar back. Above all the doors are pediments with mahogany carvings in deep relief. \r\n\r\nThe lounge bar on the left has Corinthian pilasters and columns (similar to those in the Philharmonic) with decorative wood carvings, the bar counter has a frontage of beaten copper. The bar back has carved richly polished mahogany oak panelling. The striking fireplace in the lounge bar has a marble and copper hearth, a decorative copper panel at the top and flanked by highly decorative wooden carved caryatids either side and topped off with a carved wood surround. This room also has a high ceiling with decorative plasterwork and cornices. \r\n\r\nThe smoke room on far left is accessed from the lounge bar via two doorways. This is one of the most ornate pub rooms in the country with the quality of the rear room at London's Black Friar and a \u2018must visit\u2019 on any tour of Liverpool\u2019s heritage pubs. Plasterwork on the ceiling includes the signs of the zodiac. The room is completely panelled in mahogany with bell pushes and above is a plaster frieze in very deep relief with lively putti engaged in various activities. The ornate fireplace has a beaten copper and marble hearth, with a coloured relief of a Viking ship above and a carved wood surround including pilasters either side. The fixed, upholstered seating is split into eight alcoves by part glazed wooden screens with lamps on a wooden post at the front of each with a carved capital. The lounge bar and smoke room were untouched in the alterations of 1989, which resulted in a CAMRA/English Heritage Conservation award. \r\n\r\nAt the rear there is a huge, magnificently ornate high ceilinged 'Heritage Suite\u2019 function room which, like the one at the Philharmonic, has been converted from a billiard room and shows just how important billiards was in the c.1900 pub. It has a giant order of Corinthian pilasters, a richly decorated plasterwork ceiling, a stained glass oval dome of highest quality, three chandeliers, high quality half and full height mahogany panelling and enormous marble fireplace with very decorative wood surround enormous and bevelled mirror above. There is a servery which runs all along the left side of the room but the high quality bar counter is not the original one. There were paintings in the Heritage Suite that were worth \u00a3millions so they were removed to the Walker Gallery, Liverpool and replaced by oil paintings of lesser value. Very decorative pediments over the doors. The heritage suite is only open Friday and Saturday evenings but can be visited at other quiet times such as after 3pm Sunday; Monday after 9pm. Bill Bryson famous US travel writer eulogised about the Vines in his famous book 'Notes From a Small Island'. \nSource: notes by Ted Hubbard for the Victorian Society, Dec 1967 from which some of the above text is taken.",

        "Pub Name": "Prince Arthur",
        "Address": "93 Rice Lane, Liverpool, Walton, L9 1AD",
        "Description": "The Prince Arthur has a lavish tiled interior and is well worth the effort of a visit to the suburbs of Liverpool. The plain, buff-brick three storey building itself dates from the middle to the late nineteenth century, possibly the 1880s*. It was given an impressive refitting, both externally and internally perhaps about 1905. All around the exterior below the window level are deep red tiles and the fascia board in maroon and gold states on Rice Lane side \u201cThe Prince Arthur\u201d above the entrance and 'Walker\u2019s' and 'Warrington' over the two windows and 'Ales' over the former corner entrance. On the Arthur Street side they state 'The Prince Arthur' abo'e the former corner entrance then 'Walker\u2019s Warrington Ales', \u201cThe Prince Arthur\u201d above the entrance; and \u201cMild Ales\u201d above the smoke room windows. There are four entrances (two no longer in use) that are framed by deep red tiles and polished Larvikite pilasters with terracotta capitals above. The red tiling, etched and coloured glass and unusually detailed window tracery give some idea of what to find inside. Above the two entrances in use are wreath-like circular stained and leaded panels. \r\n\r\nThe impressive interior is remarkable well preserved despite it having a period of closure prior to the pub being sold by its Pubco owners in 2011 and it is currently attracting customers with a cheap beer policy and strictly over 21\u2019s rule. The public bar is situated in the angle of the building and is surrounded by a corridor and compares with other excellent Heritage pubs on Merseyside - the Stork in Birkenhead; the Lion in Liverpool; and the Edinburgh in Crosby; \r\n\r\nAll around the wall dados and the servery are deep red tiles and regularly spaced all along them are tiles with one or two blue bells in descending sizes from top to bottom with a feature of a row of richly decorated tiles at the top that have blue bell, also ribbons and leaf symbols in gold. Another impressive feature is the screen around the back of the servery with hatches for service to the passageway. Each hatch has three colourful stained and leaded panels around it. Along the top of the screen are more colourful stained and leaded panels. Projecting across the servery, which takes up some 40% of the public bar trading area, is a modest gantry with both good decoratively etched and frosted panels and also colourful stained and leaded panels. Recently a laminate floor has been laid throughout the public bar and the passageway. \r\n\r\nThere are vestibule entrances from both the entrances on Arthur Street and Rice Lane - the latter has two doors with the right hand one now sealed and the right hand one leads to the passage. There is a drinking lobby in an expanded part of the corridor on the left hand side with another tiled dado on the wall and a hatch to the servery with three colourful stained and leaded panels around it and more colourful stained and leaded panels along the top of the screen. On the right hand side of the counter front in the public bar there are two stubby screens projecting from the counter to give a sense of separate spaces but the tiling on them seems to confirm that they never formed separate rooms. The existence of two of disused exterior doors adds weight to the idea of separate spaces but they have been treated differently in the c.1905 refurbishment which seems to indicate they were then taken out of use at that time. The short screens have four good decoratively etched and frosted panels above the tiled dado with a row of stained and leaded panels running along the top. \r\n\r\nAlong the Rice Lane side are a set of fine window screens \u2013 one has \u2018The Prince Arthur\u2019 and \u2018Walker\u2019s Ales\u2019 with good decoratively etched and frosted panels with some blue stained panels on either side of the main panels \u2013 another has \u2018Walker\u2019s 167 Whisky\u2019 and \u2018Walker\u2019s Warrington Ales\u2019 and similar side panels. Another four window screens along the Arthur Street side have less ornate panels. There is a separate smoke room at the rear which has recently lost the double doors that had \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 etched glass panels and some stained and leaded glass but it does retain its old fixed seating (now boxed in) with bell pushes all around the room however. Another recent loss is a tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace with two columns holding up the mantelshelf and three mirror panels in the wood surround above, but this was a reproduction added in the 1970s. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a grand vestibule entrance leading to the ladies toilet with good decoratively etched and frosted panels. On the rear left is the gents toilets which has three palatial Invicta urinals by Musgrave\u2019s which are among the largest remaining in the country. Can you find the **mistake in the tiling? \r\n\r\n*A letter in What's Brewing (August 2000 from Harry Garlick) suggests a date of the 1880s for the pub. The census of 1871 shows the site had no connection with the pub trade but the author's aunt was born in the pub in 1892. Architecturally the building is rather old-fashioned for the 1890s but ordinary street-corner pubs were never at the cutting edge of architectural fashion so the rather vibrant, coloured brick exterior, more usually associated with the 1860s or '70s, might be a hangover into the 1880s. \r\n\r\n**It is in the rear passage on the dado close to the internal door \u2013 two tiles have been reversed so a tile with larger blue bells is situated below one with smaller blue bells.",

        "Pub Name": "Crown Hotel",
        "Address": "43, Lime Street, Liverpool, City Centre, L1 1JQ",
        "Description": "Built in 1905 of brick with marble facing to ground floor, and on the first floor an elaborate panel with 'Walkers Ales Warrington' on the Skelhorn Street side and also ornate wording 'Crown\u2019 \u2018Hotel' between the first and second floor windows on both the side and Lime Street frontages. The spectacular feature of the Crown is the amazingly ornate richly moulded plasterwork ceilings. This was clearly a very expensive pub and Walker\u2019s were perhaps trying to rival Robert Cain\u2019s Philharmonic. Cain\u2019s then went one better with the Vines built in 1907. There are now two rooms. The rear one, with its high-quality panelling seems intact but the front one is now a large open area, the divisions between the various parts having been removed in the 19??s \u2013 two disused doors indicate there was at least three partitioned rooms when built. \r\n\r\nAbove the only entrance on Lime Street on the right-hand side is a copper band with the word 'Buffet' in relief and leads into a vestibule entrance with decorative etched glazed panels and a decorative plasterwork roof. The Crown has possibly the finest ornate ceiling in a pub \u2013 can you find the cigar shaped plasterwork? \u2013 there are five and include figures with one in their mouth, some are on the corner of the smaller square sections etc. On the right-hand wall is mahogany panelling with deep relief carvings along it all topped off by an ornate marble frieze around the room. On the right hand wall is an impressive tiled and glazed brick highly decorated large fireplace in blue, green and dark red tiles.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter has a rare copper front with fine decoration and is panelled on the return. The bar back fitting may be the original but there is much modern additions such as the panelling within the five bays and all the lower shelving has been replaced by fridges. The fixed seating looks to be original but there has been some re-working as some runs across an original door. Look for the etched window in door to gents' with 'Gents Lavatory' picked out in gold. Sadly the front room has lost its once superb window glass with only some replacement etched windows down the Skelhorn Street side. \r\n\r\nThe rear room has 'Bar' and 'Room' etched windows on the double doors with a stained and leaded glass panel above. It too has a highly decorative moulded plaster ceiling and cornice. There is dark oak panelling all around the room and a wood surround fireplace with a copper interior, tiled strips either side and a mirror in ornate surround above. The bell-pushes around the room look like modern replacements. The fixed seating looks to be post-war and all the exterior windows are plain. \r\n\r\nA winding staircase leads to the former billiard room upstairs which has a glazed dome with deep relief plasterwork frieze below. Now a large dining room it has a new bar counter, modern fixed seating, a modest frieze of crests, and good stained and leaded exterior windows.",

        "Address": "24 Roscoe Street, Liverpool, City Centre, L1 2SX",
        "Description": "Back-street pub that has been run by the same family for over 30 years, and which retains its four tiny room layout following a 1930s refit. It is undoubtedly the best example in Merseyside of how a small pub could be divided up into a series of tiny drinking areas.  The core of the pub is a drinking lobby off which other rooms radiate. The front snug is created by a 1930s part leaded glass partition with two doors \u2013 one from the porch, and one from the lobby bar. Sadly the inter-war dado tiles in both these rooms were covered over by new panelling in 2006, when fixed seating in the front snug was removed and the glass shelf around the lobby and front snug moved.\r\n\r\nThe front right small room retains 1930s fixed seating, albeit re-upholstered, bell-pushes and a 1930s fire surround with new brick fireplace. The rear snug with hatch service also has original fixed seating that has been re-upholstered, and bell-pushes in a part mirrored panel above but the fireplace is probably modern. The bar fittings date from 2006 and replace ones which dated from 1960s/1970s. A new dumb waiter has been installed in the back bar.",

        "Pub Name": "Scotch Piper",
        "Address": "Southport Road, Liverpool, Lydiate, L31 4HD",
        "Description": "Claimed to be the oldest inn in Lancashire, this is a whitewashed, thatched medieval cruck-framed building: dendrochronological dating after a thatch fire in May 1985 indicated timbers going back to c.1550. It is claimed to have been in pub use since the C15 (it may have been but there is very, very little detailed information on any individual pubs at this date, so this is probably more a matter of speculation than fact!) The brick walls encase a three-bay cruck frame and you can see the massive timbers inside. The central chimney is brick-built. In the C18 the north (right-hand) bay was added and the big sloping buttresses are C20. There was a thatch fire in 1985 after which the central gable was remodelled to its present shape. When the pub was sold to the then tenant in 1922 it had five acres of land and a number of animals were kept. It was therefore typical of many where inn-keeping was combined with other economic activity to provide a living. (Source:B. and R. Yorke, The Scotch Piper; a short history of the 'Oldest Inn in Lancashire' (1996) - available at the pub). \r\n\r\nThe Moorcroft family sold the pub to Burtonwood in 1945 and it was run by the same family until June 2014. The brewery ownership led to some important changes which are very evident today \u2013 that is the brick fireplaces and the concrete \u2018half-timbering\u2019 over the fireplaces in the left hand and middle rooms. There is a sequence of rooms running the length of the pub with a very traditional public bar including the servery on the left. The old servery with small window panels around it has been there for many years. Prior to 1997 the glazing covered the whole of the servery and service was only via the hatch over the doorway. There were no handpumps as beer was fetched from the cellar. All the bar back shelving was added in 1997. There is a good deal of old, simple woodwork in the left-hand room, including some very basic benches attached to an old partitioned wall and baffles around an old table with drawer and originally 8 legs! Changes made in 1945 here include replacing the ceiling, a new screeded floor and installing a brick fireplace. \r\n\r\nA screeded passage runs to the right and the middle room has more old, simple woodwork, an original beamed ceiling, standing timbers, old benches re-upholstered around the room, a brick fireplace added in 1945 situated under an inglenook with a cosy seat on the left side. The wall on the passageway side has been reduced from ceiling height to half height. The far right room is an addition at some point and was originally a storage area/animal shed then the landlady's living room. It still retains working bell pushes from the days of table service and old benches but the brick fireplace of 1945 has recently been replaced by a new cast iron one in 2010. Outside loos - gents', ladies' and even the disabled toilet! \r\n\r\nThe Scotch Piper is venue for one of the largest biker meets in the country on every Wednesday evening having built up from a dozen some 30 years ago to about 500 bikes on a sunny summer evening. To cater for them, a tea shed serves tea and coffee and the Scouts run a barbecue. In December 1999 Tony Blair popped in for a pint of Burtonwood Bitter in between official engagements in Merseyside. Then licensee Fred Rigby recalls: 'We didn't have any warning. Three cars pulled up and men in suits came over to check the place out. I thought the Mafia had arrived.' Mr Blair was the perfect customer - he posed for a picture and promised to sign and return a print if it was sent onto him in London when the film was developed. He was as good as his word.\r\n\r\nThe pub re-opened in April 2017 after suffering the fifth roof fire since the 1920s and second this century. There is now a fourth room - at the rear of the room with the servery is a door that leads to a small room converted from living quarters. It has a red tiled floor laid diagonally, an old brick fireplace with a log burner (not working) and two corner pews.",

It had a major refurbishment by Higsons Brewery in 1924 since when there have been few structural changes. The right-hand door leads into the public bar which retains its bar counter and bar-back and also a \u2018Higson\u2019s Ales\u2019 etched window. The public bar counter has a new top and a modern pot shelf with brass columns has been added to it. The central entrance leads into a fully panelled corridor. The inner door has a decorative etched and frosted window with 'Trade Mark Excellence' and three pigs' heads on it. The short passage before the arched opening has fielded panelled walls. The servery on the right is behind a glazed screen which has a central staff doorway and a low hatch counter each side. Above the hatches are three leaded panels. At the end of the charming lobby are the toilets with their original doors specifying the appropriate gender in etched and frosted glass in the doors \r\n\r\nLeft of the corridor is a wide arch, which seems contemporary with the rest and has panelling on the interior. This leads into the snug lounge with fixed bench seating front and rear, and front windows with 'Trade Mark Excellence', 'Higsons', and 'Trade Mark Excellence' etched and frosted glass. In the lounge there is a modern, centrally placed tiled and wood surround fireplace. Both rooms have bookshelves and trophy cabinets, thought to date from the end years of Higson's ownership i.e. 1980s. Until recently there were bell-pushes lounge to attract waiter service, which is still practised today \u2013 one of only a handful of pubs still to offer this dying aspect of pub life. Nowadays, customers sit down and the staff will come over and take orders (except at busy times, of course) \u2013 regulars will call out the name of the barman/barmaid. The barman/barmaid will also look to take extra orders when collecting glasses and your glass is low or empty. Statutorily listed in 2010 following a successful application by CAMRA.",

        "Pub Name": "Three Horseshoes",
        "Address": "69 The Street, Warham All Saints, NR23 1NL",
        "Description": "An excellent three-room pub which is very instructive in that one can see how it has grown over time and expanded into adjacent buildings. This seem to be a nineteenth-century building faced with flint cobbles and red-brick dressings under red pantiled roofs, so typical of the area. The original pub is in the block bearing the pub sign. Up to the early 1960s the pub only consisted of the current bar and a snug, which is now the servery. In view of its compactness it had a nickname of 'The Sentry Box'. To the left you will see a blocked up low arch which is also clearly visible inside too and was filled in in the mid 1960s. Old photographs on the wall show it with the cart entrance still open. Originally this was how you entered the pub - nowadays most customers enter via the rear of the premises though the door to the street from the cart arch area has recently been reopened..\n\r\nThe public bar is barely altered in many years with its quarry tile floor, dado panelling and scrubbed benches. In the windows are interesting metal grilles with the name of the former Norwich brewers, Steward & Patteson; such grilles seem to have been very common but are now a very rare feature. Take a look behind the servery and you will see the stub of a partition with a '2' on the end of it. Originally there was a sliding door across the gap between a passage to the rear and a tiny snug - hence the reason why there is a fireplace in what is now the servery. The sliding door has been retained and is situated between the present third room and the passage to the toilets. Whilst the cupboards within the servery area are genuinely old, the shelving was added in the mid 1980s, as was the floor since the old one collapsed. The beer was originally fetched from the cellar and the staircase down to it was on the left of the passage (now blocked up) but the '3' over the door has been retained. A hole was cut in the wall between the bar and the snug to create the small hatch/counter in the 1960s.\n\r\nTo the left of the coach arch was originally a general store which closed many years ago and when they took over in the mid 1980s the present owners did run it as a mini shop for the first 18 months before converting it to the third room. Although the second and third rooms do look authentic being crammed with various items of memorabilia including brewery and distillers' posters, an old Juke Box and one-armed bandits, farming implements etc. they are both creations - even the two doors with 'Billiards' and 'Room' etched glass panels on them have been imported.",

        "Description": "Refitted in about 1910 with few alterations since. The layout, the result of a highly unusual partition, is, from CAMRA's considerable research, considered to be the only remaining example. The very rare partition with its iron stays attached to the ceiling forms a corridor down the left side that allowed those using the off-sales counter in the middle of the pub privacy from people in the bar. A door in the partition leads into the basic, panelled front bar, which was once two small rooms, it retains its original bar counter, original bar-back with drawers and shelves held up by fluted pilasters, bench seating with bell-pushes and Edwardian tiled fireplace. The off-sales area still retains its counter but the area is usually filled up with a cigarette machine and other clutter. The rear smoke room beyond an Edwardian glazed partition wall has a small continuation of the original bar back in the public bar, an old, but not original, fireplace and more recent bench seating.",

It has a decoratively carved U-shaped bar counter with a marble top, mosaic flooring and a lavishly decorated almost square island-style bar-back fitting with bevelled mirrors. Around the room is a dado of Victorian panelling with a row of bevelled mirrors above the dado. A carved possibly mahogany fire surround with bevelled mirrors in panelling above held up by slender columns with capital. Stained glass windows at the rear of the room. There is no secure date for all this but it must be from the golden age of British pub-building around 1900. Everything has been well preserved. The fittings in the left-hand room date from the mid 1990s but the bar back fitting incorporates fittings from a former reception. Counter dates from mid 1990s and the dado panelling is modern.

        "Pub Name": "Star Inn",
        "Address": "Netherton, Netherton, NE65 7HD",
        "Description": "A pub is known to have existed here since 1788. The present building consists of two parts, the older (C19), lower, left-hand wing and the much bigger right-hand block with finely-dressed masonry on the main facade. The latter was added in 1902 and was bought in 1917 by the grandfather of present owner Miss Vera W. Wilson-Morton. The plate on the inner doors with the name of the proprietor and the name of the premises harks back to the hotel days. The interior is unchanged in 80 years. From the entrance one walks into a hallway with a tiny servery where the landlady serves beer from the cellar - note the signs requesting to you always walk to the counter to collect your drinks and change - no table service here!. There is a table with chairs in the servery area but it is rarely used. \r\n\r\nThe range of drinks on offer is restricted to just one beer currently Cameron's Strongarm (for years it was Castle Eden Ale until production ceased in Feb. 2009), cans of lager, various spirits - the optics are hidden away on the wall to the left of the servery/counter - and soft drinks. There is no food whatsoever on sale - not even crisps or nuts as Vera does not approve of grease marks  on the glasses! On the wall at right-angles to the servery counter is a small Ushers Pale Ale mirror. \r\n\r\nThe public room - and there is only one - is a classic of its kind. It is situated in the 1902 part, immediately on the right as one enters and has a door with three metal 'protectors' on each side. There is nothing fancy about it - it is just a large, plain square with bare slatted fixed seating running round all the sides (plus some movable tables and chairs, of course - but note the handwritten sign \"please do not shift the armchairs and tables\"!). Above a good 1950s tiled fireplace is a particularly fine, huge mirror advertising Usher's Pale Ale from Edinburgh. \r\n\r\nIf you ask Vera if there is another room she may deny there is. However, there is a room directly behind the servery which it is believed to have been used as a second public room in the past and is only accessed by walking through the servery. It is now part of the living accommodation but can be brought into use on rare occasions when the pub is busy. This may occur if, say, 30 people turn up for quiz nights, which are held on the first Wednesday of the month from February to October. \nOutside gents' and ladies' toilets across the car park - one must pick up the key (blue tag for the gents'!) from the counter to open and close them! Note if a round consists of two or more pints of beer you will get dimple glasses with different coloured small round stickers on them so that when you ask for a second pint you will guarantee to get the same glass back - no modern ideas such as 'a fresh glass every time' here! Please note the opening hours are very restricted.",

        "Pub Name": "Vale Hotel",
        "Address": "Mansfield Road, Nottingham, Daybrook, NG5 3GG",
        "Description": "Built as a hotel 1935-37, it was designed by T Cecil Howitt* of Nottingham, for Home Ales Brewery. The brewery offices situated a few hundred metres up the A60 is also a classic piece of 1930s architecture. This was a prestige pub for the brewery with two single storey wings with Art Deco style semi-circular bowed windows. A new room was added at the rear in a single storey wing in similar style with a bay window by Howitt & Partners in 1964. The original plan has been retained with only a modest opening-up. The Vale preserves important aspects of its late 1930s \u2018Moderne\u2019-style character with the lounge (centre front) and lobby to its right being nationally-important classic pieces of \u201930s pub architecture. It is prominently sited on a corner site and is the epitome of what inter-war pub-builders were seeking to achieve - a place for civilised drinking and entertainment which would appeal to young and old, men and women. Has a notable inn sign (which is subject of a separate statutory listing) consisting of a circular base with carved bench seats and a fluted Doric column of stone with a capital topped with a three sided lantern with replaced sign boards.  \r\n \r\nThe main entrance leads to an internal porch with a lovely timber and glass screen. Behind this is a lobby with woodwork that looks as though it would have been at home on an ocean liner or an up-market '30s cinema. The front room, originally called the Smoke Room and Buffet, retains its original counter with a fluted bar front and bar back which is largely the original 1930s work even down to some small shelves in the units but a number of shelves in the top section have been removed and a single fridge has been placed in the lower shelving. Within the original wooden panelling are three HB circular roundels that refer to Home Brewery. Until 2011 it was entered directly from the glazed porch but the door was removed and re-sited in a new opening to the public bar: the roundel from that position was re-sited to the former entrance position: only really close inspection will detect these carefully made changes.  \r\n \r\nOn the right is the main Lounge Bar, originally it was a Lounge Hall on the left near the servery and a separate Lounge but the division between them has been removed. The lounge has some original wooden panelling and a piece of original seating but a few years ago the old fixed seating in the bay window was removed; also an inappropriate Victorian-style fireplace has been added. The bar counter here looks like one from the 1960s and the alcove just past it was originally where a staircase was situated. The metal frame casement windows, original wooden door surrounds and doors with distinct long chrome door handles, original coving, and some original light fittings have been retained.  \r\n \r\nOn the left with its own entrance lobby is the public bar (now only in use for functions) which has lost its old fixed seating in the bay window in recent years, and has a modern bar counter (in the listed description dated 1996 it says \u2018original\u2019!) and modern bar-back fitting added. A small section of dado panelling might be original. When built there was an off sales accessed via a door at the rear left of the building but while the door remains the internal space has been absorbed into the kitchen. The original plan shows that you had to go outside and back into the gents\u2019 toilets on the public bar side and walk through the exterior lobby to reach the gents\u2019 in the lounge. \r\n \r\nAt the rear is the small children's room (now a carvery) in the wing added in 1964 \u2013 note how similar brick was used and the windows are of a 1930s Crittal style. This doorway from the lounge was widened in 2003 and there are no old fittings. \r\n \r\n*T Cecil Howitt, a nationally known 1930s pub architect, was also responsible for the Wheatsheaf, Burton Joyce, east of Nottingham but, sadly, the interior has been totally re-developed.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther  surviving Art Deco interiors can be found at these Heritage Pubs\r\nThree Pigeons, Halifax, West Yorkshire; \r\nTest Match, West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire;\r\nDuke (of York), Bloomsbury, London WC1;\r\nPortland Arms, Glasgow;\r\nSteps Bar, Glasgow;\r\nand\r\nFrews Bar, Dundee; in the Sporting Memories Lounge.",

        "Pub Name": "Olde Trip to Jerusalem",
        "Address": "Brewhouse Yard, Nottingham, NG1 6AD",
        "Description": "A very remarkable pub, parts of which date back to the early 17th\u00a0and\u00a018th centuries (and not the 12th century as the date outside might have you to believe!).\u00a0In part it is half-timbered but what makes it particularly special is the way it extends back into the castle rock in a series of hewed-out rooms on two levels. Above the main entrance door is a colourful glass panel with the words \u201cAda G Etherington-Ward, Licensed Brewer, Retailer of Beer, Wines, Spirits & Tobacco to be consumed on or off the premises\u201d - 'The Trip' was owned by the Ward family for 100 years until they sold it to Hardy & Hansons for a reputed \u00a31 million in 1990.  \r\n\r\nA flagstone passage runs past the door to the servery with a \u20181\u2019 on it to the first of five rooms \u2013 the Ward Room, originally the Tap Room, which is partly hollowed out of the sandstone and has a flagstone floor with leatherette covered high backed settles all around at least 50 years old, and a large black painted brick fireplace at least 70 years old. On the back wall is a black iron hook with a ring tied to a piece of string hanging from the ceiling. This is the traditional pub game of 'Ringing The Bull'. Have a go at throwing the ring across the room with the aim of hooking it over the 'bull', you will do well to get it over!\r\n\r\nAs you walk further into the pub there is a tiny snug on the right created during alterations in 1997-8. Between the main bar and the rock-cut areas at the back lies the servery with identical panelled counters on three sides that do look more post-war work than pre-war - the bar back fitting is mostly modern. A staircase leads upwards and backwards to Mortimer\u2019s Room which has a \u20184\u2019 on the door with a stained and leaded glazed panel. This lounge appears to have been refitted about 1930, the date of the quarter circle fielded panelled bar counter and brick fireplace, but the bar back fitting is modern. Note the unusual clock - dated 1856 \u2013 with the minute hand set to Greenwich time; and the 'cursed galleon' now in a glass case  hanging above the bar which, according to legend, the last three cleaners to clean it died mysteriously, so it has not been cleaned for over 50 years! From here there leads off a passage formed in the rock in 1997-8 to another small room (previously an office) hewn out of the sandstone. \r\n\r\nDownstairs is a room with a number '3' on the door originally called the Bar Parlour with a modern quarry tiled floor, a small range fireplace indicating it may have been a domestic kitchen in the distant past and some leather covered fixed bench seating which is difficult to date. Up three steps there is a small Snug which also only opened in 1996 and is a conversion from living accommodation. It has a 1930s tiled and wood surround fireplace and a parliamentary clock (or old moon dial, a clock shaped dial on the wall which indicates the phases of the moon?). The 1997-8 works won a CAMRA/English Heritage award.",

        "Pub Name": "Five Ways Hotel",
        "Address": "Edwards Lane, Nottingham, Sherwood, NG5 3HU",
        "Description": "UPDATE 2017. \u2028Closed 2015 and now the AlQuba Masjid and Cultural Centre so re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nAn imposing road house of 1936-7 to the designs of A. E. Eberlin of Nottingham for Newark brewers, Warwicks & Richardsons. A stylish 'brewers' Tudor' exterior with limestone facing below and half-timbering above. The original plan has largely survived and the pub has an excellent display of original furnishings. \n\nAn L-shaped corridor runs from the door facing the ring road to the door on the Edwards Lane side. Throughout it has panelling to two-thirds height of an unusual narrow design and finishes with a ledge that can be used as a shelf for customers taking part in passageway drinking. Here the corridor has always been a popular place for drinkers and in the past had a number of tables but these have all been removed in recent times so this activity is becoming rarer here and elsewhere these days. In the angle where the two parts of the corridor meet there are two serving hatches / small counters with fielded panelled fronts, copper tops, a rising lower and fixed upper multi-glazed screens. Nowadays, following the opening of the new main bar, both are likely to be in the closed position and only used at very busy times so it is a good job that the lower panels were left intact enabling them to be closed! The listed description states \u201cIn rear corridor a dumb waiter to cellar and a mirror set above the panelling.\u201d but they are no longer visible. \n\nOff the Edwards Road end of the corridor is a door with the figure  \u20182\u2019 on it leading to a smoke room on the right now called the Ken Yarwood Room. This splendid room is panelled to picture frame height with the standard sized fielded panels finishing with an ornately carved top horizontal oblong panel bearing Jacobean detail which runs the length of two lower ones all to create an olde worlde atmosphere. There is a Tudor arch shaped stone fireplace with herringbone brick interior \u2013 it is a pity that a TV screen obliterates the decoratively carved Jacobean detailing on the overmantel. Service is via a small counter (or large hatch) with a fielded panelled bar counter front, copper bar top, the original multi-glazed upper fixed panel remains but the lower rising screen has been lost. Expect to see a \u201cPlease order your meals and drinks from the main bar\u2019 sign here. The bar back fitting is mostly the original with some modern wood additions. There are two plasterwork roses on the high ceiling. \n\nAt the other end of the corridor double doors, which are nearly always locked, lead to the lounge / piano lounge now called the Sherwood Room. It has a plastered segmental ceiling with two attractive plaster bands with vine trails and grapes marking out the 3-bay division; in each bay a plaster band decorated with foliage. It retains a post-war bar counter and bar back fitting (possibly added when they built the function room and its servery which backs onto it?), has a raised area at the rear, a brick fireplace and lots of loose furniture. \n\nOpposite is the original public bar still with the \u2018Public Bar\u2019 black on white glazed and leaded panel in the top of the door but visible on the inside only. This room is now in use as a small dining room and has bar counter and bar back fitting that may have elements of their 1930s original but are mainly modern and the fixed seating does not tie in with the listed description wording (1999) of \u201ccontemporary fixed seating\u201d. The lobby leading to the off sales is visible from the exterior on the Edwards Lane side where its door remains. \n\nIn the centre of the corridor is an expanded area in front of the former garden entrance, which later became double doors leading to a function room with dance floor - all a post-war addition. As a function room it had 4 reused Victorian cast-iron columns with foliage and animal head detail in the capitals. Then in 2012 the original doors were removed and two new doors added that lead to what is the new \u2018Main Bar\u2019, which you will have\u2026some text missing.",

        "Pub Name": "Test Match Hotel",
        "Address": "Gordon Road, West Bridgford, NG2 5LP",
        "Description": "In the Test Match and the Vale Hotel, Arnold, Nottinghamshire has two of the best Art Deco pub interiors in England. Built in 1938 for Hardys & Hansons Ltd of Kimberley, the two brewers having merged in 1930, the Test Match is one of the finest surviving inter-war pubs in the country. It was the first new licensed premises to be allowed in West Bridgeford in the twentieth century, and the owners and their architect, A. C. Wheeler, were at pains to ensure the building was well-appointed and up-to-the minute in its details. The buff brick exterior gives little hint of what to expect within. \n\nBehind the central portico is a revolving door (added in 1950) which sweeps you into a remarkable two-storey high room. The cricketing motif is expressed in wall paintings (of c.1950) by the Nottinghamshire artist, T. L. B. Hutchinson, of festooned bats, an urn for the ashes, and notable cricketers. The latter are William Clarke, who laid out the county ground, and the great batsman George Parr. This room is the lounge and the up-to-date feel was conveyed by the cinema-style ceiling lighting and Art Deco detailing of the woodwork and fireplace (the latter has a marble surround flanked by sapele columns). The wall panelling is English ash. A wide staircase leads upstairs to a cocktail bar and impressively complete, original toilets (note the Art Deco-style lettering).\n\nTo right is a further bar, formerly a gents only smoke room, with lower ceiling and linked to the lounge by an opening widened in the late C20. The wall panelling is similar to that in the lounge. The public bar (shown in our picture) - separate and on the left of the building - has a remarkably complete assemblage of 1930s work. There is terrazzo flooring in jazzy geometrical patterns of yellow, grey, orange and black. The bar counter rises in three tiers of rectangular panels, breaking forward as they rise; simple shelving to bar back and a fire surround of slate blocks with angular detail. At the rear of the building is an assembly room with gently curved ceiling with moulded transverse ribs and spine. At the springing a moulded cornice with large projecting features above brackets containing up-lighting.\n\nA major refurbishment was carried out in 2001 but was undertaken with great sensitivity in view of the grade II* listing that had been given to the Test Match. The main change was opening the front part to  the assembly room, and the installation of kitchens at the back of the latter. The materials and designs were of excellent quality and, although the pub is not 'intact', its remarkable qualities still make it one of CAMRA's Heritage pubs. The 2001 work was carried out by Oulsnam Design of Bakewell and won the refurbishment award in CAMRA's Pub Design Awards.\n\nIn the book 'The Inns & Pubs of Nottinghamshire: Stories behind the Names' by Gordon Wright & Brian J Curtis - Nottinghamshire County Council, 1995, ISBN 0-900943-81-5 the authors explain the pub name as follows: \u201cFor 44 years West Bridgford Defence Association had waged a stubborn battle against the granting of a licence. When eventually the Kimberley Brewery obtained permission from the licensing magistrates at Shire Hall to put up their \u2018hotel\u2019 their chairman, clearly relieved that the long protracted struggle was at last over, was heard to remark \u2018that it had been as hard to win as a 'test\u2019 against Australia\u2019 \u201c.\n\nOther  surviving Art Deco interiors can be found at these Heritage Pubs\nThree Pigeons, Halifax, West Yorkshire; \nVale Hotel, Arnold, Nottinghamshire;\nDuke (of York), Bloomsbury, London WC1;\nPortland Arms, Glasgow;\nSteps Bar, Glasgow;\nand\nFrews Bar, Dundee; in the Sporting Memories Lounge.",

        "Description": "This is one of the truly great country classic pub and is named after an 1837 GWR locomotive, not the heavenly body - former long term licensee Jack Cox changed the pub sign as he liked trains! A timber porch with some fixed seating - now the smoking shelter! - leads into the core of the pub, a room with three settles in the centre focusing on the fireplace - an extraordinary characterful survival. There are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the \r\nHolly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire; \r\n Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; andAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nIronwork on the settles used to carry curtains for greater privacy and warmth. Quarry tile floor - look for the figure '4' to the right of the gap between the settles. There is also one full height short partition. The fire surround looks possibly inter-war or immediate post war (infill looks more 1950s). \r\n\r\nThere's no bar counter: the main bar has service via a stable door from the ground floor cellar. This is one of only six traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.\r\n\r\nThe cellar area was much modernised following the death of Jack Cox whose family ran the pub for 150 years. There is still some old shelving and extra ones added, casks are on a modern stillage as the photo above the door shows - in Jack's day the casks were on a stillage on the right hand (window) side. Many locals stand drinking in the passageway around the settles so it can be a challenge to get to the cellar if busy! The second room with a number '2' on the door has a bare wood floor, a 1950s brick fireplace, some dado panelling could be modern and is served from a hatch to the cellar. \r\n\r\nThere is a plain further room (numbered 1) room across a corridor further back in the pub which has a 1950s brick fireplace and is used for shooting dinners and darts. There is a plan to extend the rear room so as to make it more attractive for functions. Outdoor Ladies' and Gents' - in the gap between the gents urinals which are attached to the  the pub and the WC's are two Aunt Sally pub game pitches as the pub sports two teams.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2015. \u2028Although in the same ownership as the adjacent pub, the HALFWAY HOUSE (which is still open), the Seven Stars survives as it was when it closed. There are two front rooms and a small back bar with a counter. The landlady of the Halfway House states that some customers still take their pints in there, and it is occasionally used for beer festivals and events. However, the Seven Stars is not licensed.  \n\nThis pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nAn amazing survival - a tiny beerhouse sited alongside a much larger, modernised Marston's house called, unsurprisingly, the Halfway House. The Seven Stars consists of a single public room equipped with a couple of high-back settles and a bench beneath the front window. The fireplace dates from the 1920s and the red-tiled floor is probably of the same time. This is one of the last-surviving examples of an almost vanished type - a public house in the old sense of the term where you can come to someone's private house and find a room for public use.\n\nThe front entrance is into a corridor with a small room each side, one with an old settle. The corridor leads through a door into a small rear bar with a counter.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020.  A refurbishment has recently been carried out which requires a re-assessment.  Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nA modest whitewashed building just a mile from the Welsh border which up to 1994 used to double as the village shop (see the big window on the right). The two original pub rooms and passageway are little changed due to there having been only two owners since 1939 - Bill & Peggy Jones ran the pub from 1939 to 1989 and Phil and Hilda Rothera from 1989 to 2015. However, in 2017 a significant refurbishment took place in order to attract the food trade and the floor area of the modern parts is now greater than the original rooms and passageway. \n\n\nThe front door leads into a small lobby with red tiled floor and on the right is a door with the number \u20182\u2019 on it which leads to the what is called the \u2018Music Room\u2019 as this was the venue for Irish musicians every Thursday night (check). The left hand door is not in use but beyond it is a dining room - see later). The Music Room has a red tiled floor, good leather-covered very old fixed seating round the walls and an inglenook-style fireplace possibly from the 1930s and there is a piano. A doorway leads to a passageway with a red tiled floor and old dado panelling still with a door at the end but this is now permanently open making the modern parts clearly visible. \n\nOn the other side of the tiled passageway in the small public bar with a red and black tiled floor and old tongue and groove dado. The bar has a Victorian panelled counter and old top and the handpumps have a date of 1947 on them. The only recent change has been to the bar back fitting which was of four sections but the left hand part (which was a post-war addition) was removed in 2017 to create a doorway so staff could serve customers at a new small bar behind. The central upper part of the bar back fitting is genuinely old with mirrored panels but below it are some 1960s changes with modern shelves on a brick base so it looks like casks were stillaged here in the past. \n\nThe right hand section of the bar back looks old but not as old as the central section. In addition there is another section on the right hand wall which is definitely post-war. The public bar has fixed seating around the walls that might date from before or just after the war and the stone fireplace dates from c1970. This still remains very traditional with its Britannia type tables and log fires in winter. \n\nFurther back are two rooms that have been brought into use in modern times - a small games room on the left, formerly a living room; and In what used to be the stables there was a large entertainments room which could hold up to 90 and was used for Irish Set Dancing on a Thursday night before the musicians appear, and hosted occasional folk nights. It could also be converted to a skittle alley including a ball return made from plastic drain pipes! \n\nThe 2016-7 changes saw the \u2018outside\u2019 toilets replaced by new ones situated in the former shop area; the former games room (with a locked door from the front lobby) is now a small modern dining room; the former function room / skittle alley at the rear has been converted into a large dining room; and a new small bar added between the public bar and the new large dining room to serve diners.",

        "Address": "1 Church Street, Shrewsbury, SY1 1UG",
        "Description": "A wonderful unspoilt pub right in the heart of Shrewsbury - its interest lies in a series of four separate rooms so that it looks much as it would have done a hundred years ago. The white-painted three-storey building dates back to the C18 with a single storey extension of the late 19th or early 20th century which houses the lounge bar. It was purchased by Banks's (now Marston's) brewery in 1994 who has taken good care of it including spending some \u00a31/4 million in 2008 (the pub closed for 8 months) to stop it leaning further! The left hand door leads to an uneven brick-floored passageway with a serving hatch on the right. To the left is the Gentlemen's Bar (now an outlawed feature of pub life!) formed by a timber partition with an iron stay attached to a ceiling beam and borrowed glazing along the top. The partition acts as bare high backed settle and the exterior wall is lined with reused C16 oak panelling with bench seating attached. This splendid small quarry tiled room retains an old 'Smoke Room' etched window and has a Victorian (EH) (looks 30s brick to me)  inglenook-style fireplace across the corner with bracketed shelf above. There are some old (non-working) bell pushes still in place and a slate shove ha'penny table is always available for play. \n\nThe tiny front bar has a counter (date??) and an old mirrored bar back with a more modern lower section, although there were some changes in 2008 following the structural repairs but essential what was there was mainly put back. This homely room contains a plain timber dado, a small cast fireplace and two benches which are of no great age. At the rear left is the tiny snug / 'Poet's Corner' with a red quarry tiled floor and brown painted plaster walls with wooden frames to give the effect of panelling. It has old padded bench seating all around the room, a small cast-iron fireplace (age?) and just two tables. The corridor runs around the back of the servery to the lounge bar which was last refurbished in the 1930s. It has a parquet floor, fixed seating on two sides with panelling above it (but no sign of bell pushes), a brick fireplace and service from a hatch to the side of the servery, all from the 1930s.",

        "Address": "12 Green Street, Bath, BA1 2JZ",
        "Description": "Built c1770 and part of a Georgian terrace in the centre of Bath, a World Heritage Site. It was refurbished in a very restrained way and extended to the rear in 1926 by local architect, W.A. Williams, and retains a complete ensemble of good-quality panelling in the two rooms and the drinking lobby in front of the servery. The shop-like frontage was added as part of the 1926 changes and the entrance passageway has fielded panelled walls and a parquet floor. All the doors still bear the numbers that were used to identify the rooms for licensing purposes. To the left a latch door with brass plaque and the figure '1' leads into the very small lounge at the front of the pub. It has completely wood panelled walls with fixed seating along the front window side and a small glazed brick fireplace. Service is through a doorway to the side of the servery. Note the latch door with the figure '4' on it that leads to the cellar. \r\n\r\nFront the entrance passageway a door with the figure \u20182\u2019 on it leads into the main small public bar in the middle of the pub. It also has more fielded panelled walls, a similar panelled bar counter front, parquet floor, modest skylight, glazed small brick and wood surround fireplace with old simple gas fire and a shelf above and just a couple of bar stools so stand up drinking is the norm here. Doors with leaded glass in the top of them at the rear lead to the toilets \u2013 the ladies on the right and on the left down 11 steep stone steps is the gents\u2019, which retains its 1926 urinals with glazed red brick walls and quarry tiled floor. \r\n\r\nFrom the public bar a latch door with two leaded panels in the top, the figure '3' and a 'Smoke Room' on brass plaque leads to the rear room which also has a parquet floor. This small room also has fielded panelling on all the walls with bench seating down both sides, a 1930's brick fireplace in the wood panelling and service from a doorway to the side of the servery. For a small city centre pub to have retained its three small rooms unchanged since 1926 is quite remarkable.",

        "Pub Name": "Star Inn",
        "Address": "23 Vineyards, Bath, BA1 5NA",
        "Description": "The Star is a wonderful survival being an unpretentious town pub, which retains its five-room interior and fittings from 1928. First licensed in 1760s, it is set among the splendours of Bath's world famous Georgian architecture being in a late 18th century terrace. In 1928 it was extended by taking half of its neighbour 22 Vineyards. Outside it is a severe, plain building of four storeys, faced with smooth local stone. On the frontage is a late Victorian painted inscription that reads 'ALE. THE STAR INN. HOUSE'. Inside you meet a sequence of four rooms which were initially fitted out probably at the end of the 19th century. Then in 1928 it was refurbished by local architect, W.A. Williams with the work carried out by Gaskill & Chambers, famous for the supply of \u2018beer engines\u2019 (handpumps) to pubs throughout the land. \r\n\r\nThe main door with a figure \u20182' on the inside leads to a small lobby. To the left of this is a lounge which has a figure '1' on the door, parquet floor and with a rear alcove. This room has extensive panelling of 1928 including bell pushes and incorporating a wood surround fireplace with a mirror above and original upholstered bench seating. There are plans on the walls showing the creation of the left-hand room in 1928 and minor changes following war damage in 1942. Returning to the hall there are 'Bat Wing' doors leading to the ladies which is up a flight of stairs and next door leads to the modernised gents. The hallway has a leather seated settle and there is more fielded panelling on the walls. \r\n\r\nTo the right of the lobby is a doorway with a Bostwick iron grill gate permanently folded back leading to a small snug known as Death Mans Row. It has fixed seating along the street wall and a splendid small carved bar counter with no dispensers. High up on the left there is a telephone dating from 1920s which has three positions - 'To Call Exchange', 'Challenge Before Calling' and 'For Code Ringing'. High up on the front wall is the old bell box with three windows 'Lounge', 'Lounge Recess' and an unnamed one. Alongside nestled on a ledge are tins of snuff on sale and the pub offers customers a complimentary pinch of snuff. \r\n\r\nA timber screen with glazed panels above separates the snug from a small public room behind, which is known as the 'Glass Room'. This has a wonderful drop-down shove ha'penny board, an old stone fireplace, bench seating attached to the wall panelling around three sides and service is from the doorway to the bar. \r\n\r\nA further screen with a row of six glazed panels in the top separates the Glass Room from the public bar which has a narrow door with the figure '4' on it. The servery is largely inter-war work with a good carved bar counter that has short screens on the right, and one on the left that forms a small office area. The bar back is, unusually, set at 90 degrees to the counter, and is a splendid wooden affair with leaded windows, bevelled mirror panels, two cigar cupboards and topped off with a clock. Note the doors to the cellar where landlords in the past would have transferred casks from the cellar to the bar area using a lift which rose through these doors. This small room has more fixed seating around three sides with baffles at each end and a splendid stone fireplace with carving above. \r\n\r\nOn the back wall of the servery are casks of Bellringer on individual stillage (these recently replaced draught Bass for which the pub is famous, which is no longer available in 18 gallon casks). This is one of only a handful of pubs left in the country where beer is still served in the time-honoured way from the cask into a glass jug and then from the jug into your glass. Other Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Barley Mow, Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire; Holly Bush, Makeney, Derbyshire; Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire and Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, West Wales; Falcon, Arncliffe, North Yorkshire; and Cresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales.\r\n\r\nOn the extreme right of the pub is a narrow corridor, now the darts room, which has the original entrance door on Vineyards accessed via a flight of seven stone steps. There is a leather covered bench and note the door to the right with door protectors that was the serving hatch for outdoor sales. The darts board is usually situated high up the wall so you have to bring it down to play! On the first floor there was formerly a clubroom that had a snooker table at one time. Now it is an office for Abbey Ales, a move that helped to secure this wonderful pub for future generations along with turning the top two stories into flats. \r\n\r\nIn Bath Pubs by Kirsten Elliott & Andrew Swift (Akeman Press, 2002), the Star is described as \u201ca national treasure\u201d and adds \u201cit looks like pubs used to look before they were Red Barrelised, made over, departitioned, Laura Ashleyfied, fruit-machined, nitro-kegged, alco-popped, Al Caponed, distressed, bamboozled or just plain ******ed up.\u201d It continues \u201c In 1991 the interior was under severe threat, as reported in the Bath Chronicle \u2018the Star, in the Paragon, unchanged for more than 100 years, may now lose most of its drinking space in favour of offices in a deal between owners Bass Brewery and a London based property company which hopes to buy the site for offices, then lease back the ground floor to Bass. Under the scheme all the wood panelled rooms would go \u2013 reducing the pub to one room instead of five. rooms above would also become office space.\u201d. Bath Pubs, continues \u201cBut thanks to all those who fought to preserve the Star, including landlord, Alan Perrett, Bass was foiled in its bid to destroy a piece of Bath\u2019s heritage as important, in its own way, as the Abbey and the Roman Baths.\u201d",

        "Pub Name": "Tucker's Grave",
        "Address": "Faulkland, BA3 5XF",
        "Description": "A three-room pub with no bar counter and a superb tap room. It is in an eighteenthth-century cottage which has been a pub for over 200 years. The name comes from the burial place of a suicide, Edwin Tucker, who died in 1747. The two original delightfully unspoilt pub rooms with simple panelling and fixed bench seating are either side of a central corridor with old panelling. On the right is the tap room - note the Georgian lettering on the door which probably dates from the early nineteeth-century, if not the late eighteenth-century, and is surely among, if not the, the earliest pub lettering in the country. It survived because, at some point, it was covered by a screwed-on-sign. This small basic room has wall benches and some bell pushes. The mantelshelf over the old stone fireplace was replaced in 2007 when the previous one caught fire and the room required re-painting due to smoke damage. \r\n\r\nOn the left of the corridor a latch door leads to the tiny public bar which has a genuine Victorian tiled fireplace, some old bar back shelving near the door and above the window but more modern shelving opposite. There is no bar counter - casks of beer and poly-casks of cider are stacked in the bay window which has external shutters to protect the barrels from the sun. A third room to the far left was formerly the living room and was brought into use in 1985 - it has a Victorian tiled fireplace with marble surround. At the end of the passage which gets very narrow is a door leading to the outside gents' and ladies' on the rear right of the building. There is a skittle alley in a separate stone building at the rear. \r\n\r\nThis is one of only six traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.",

The dispensers include a rare beer engine manufactured by Dalex with levers shaped like a knife handle and blade jutting horizontally out of the beer engine casing. It is still in use, and probably dates from between the world wars - the only other known set in use is at the Star, Lidgate in Suffolk. The two original rooms are the Piano Room and the room, formerly the male preserve, known as the Men's Kitchen situated on the front right of the building. It has a latch door with the figure '2' on it, a genuine stone-flagged floor, old dado panelling on the walls, range fireplace, and seating consisting of two splendid old bare benches. The passage from the front door also has a panelled dado and a basic long low bench. The other original room is the Piano Room in the middle front of the building, also with a stone-flagged floor, a brick fireplace from the 1930s, old panelled dado, but it no longer has a piano! Note the small shelves where drinks could rest after being served.\n\r\nOn the left of the building are two rooms brought into use - the front one was the family parlour or living room and the rear was created in 1984 on the site of the original outside gents toilets. In the cellar are there was no bar counter at all until the 1960s then a tiny one was added with a Formica top. Following a severe flood in December 2008 when the pub had some 12,000 gallons of water in it, a new similar sized replacement counter was added, as well as new shelves to replace the original old ones. The small wooden barrel on a stillage was how cider was served prior to the flood - now the cider is kept in the cellar and sold by electric pump from the row of 'keg-type' dispensers. The two left rooms have a new slate-like tiled floor. The former parlour has a stone fireplace, the rear room good bench seating and this is the room you are likely to find a number of locals sitting in. The outside toilets at the rear date from the 1950s, the first time there were toilets for ladies. There is a games room with a pool table at the rear left in another modern extension and the skittle alley is in a separate building at the rear right of the pub. The Elderflowers Food Co-operative sets up in the Mens Kitchen every Friday from 5pm to 7pm, selling locally produced, mostly organic, food at keen prices.",

        "Pub Name": "White Hart Hotel",
        "Address": "The Island, Midsomer Norton, BA3 2HQ",
        "Description": "A traditional town centre pub, probably of the 1880s, built of local stone with a little red brick banding. It now has three-rooms but originally consisted of a public bar and lounge but changes in the 1980s expanded the trading area. Through the front door is the entrance lobby which has an old settle and it retains its Jug and Bottle hatch, which is still used for service to customers drinking in the lobby and passageway. On the left a small vestibule with full-height panelling and double doors leads to the public bar. This retains its counter, panelled dado, Victorian marble surround, fixed benches and (perhaps the most attractive feature) shelving and balusters in the bar back. Near the entrance the counter bulges out in a curious fashion, probably to create an entrance area for staff and an arrangement for outdoor sales. 1984 plans by Bass Wales and Western Ltd of Cardiff (job architect D.G. Emery), approved in 1985, led to slight alterations, including the odd kinked-in portion of the counter to give access to the remodelled gents\u2019, and also modifcations to the other end of the servery. Note that the real ale is served from casks on an old stillage under the jug and bottle hatch and real cider - popular here - is served on handpump.\r\n\r\nRight of the main entrance is what was before 1985 the lounge, now known as the snug: it is quite plainly appointed with some fixed seating and the panelled dado painted a very untraditional light green. The 1985 plans also created the saloon at the rear from what were the former beer store and a private lounge: a new counter and servery were introduced and thus the pub took its present form. A skittle alley was added probably in the 1950s or 1960s.",

A dignified exterior with a splendid wrought-iron inn sign on one of the corners and a surprisingly spacious interior of two rooms and a central corridor. It has been in the same family ownership since 1943 and the only change has been the adding of inside toilets in 1981 on the rear left. The flagstone central corridor leads up to a glazed-in servery. It has three sections with the left and middle sections having the bottom sections open for serving. This is a popular area for customers to drink. Behind the screen are old cupboards, shelving and an old set of now-disused handpumps with porcelain handles set against the left wall.  There is no proper till - notes are placed in various cupboards and coins go into small dishes. \r\n\r\nOn the left is the main public bar with a '2' on the door. and also a flagstone floor. It has simple bench and window seating attached to old dado panelling all painted turquoise, a 1930s brick painted red and wood-surround fireplace and service via a small hatch to the cellar complete with sliding glazed door. The cellar has a '5' on the door from the servery and has an old stillage at the rear which now contains polycasks of cider, originally it was for wooden casks of cider - cask beer is served using a handpump attached to shelving in the cellar. Rich's cider is sold at a remarkably low price and as a result the pub sells three times the amount of cider than real ale. To the right is the Commercial Room with shutters on the windows, a bar billiards table, table skittles, a couple of tables and metal framed, leatherette-padded chairs. Note the two old devices to ring service bells which were disabled in 2007 - if you look behind the servery you can see the old service bell box on the staircase.",

The timber frame is exposed on the left hand gable wall, the right hand gable end is of stone and the front has been rebuilt in modern brick. The present front door leads to the small public bar with an old red quarry tiled floor. The oldest internal features are the possibly 17th century panelling on the left hand partition wall and beamed ceiling. The bar counter looks like it is from the 1930s, which could be the date of the bar back shelving which includes some slender pillars. there is a small area to the left of the servery for customers to stand and be served from a hatch/doorway. Note the old gas lamps on either side of the servery. The mantelpiece is genuinely old and almost reaches the ceiling but the fireplace itself was installed by Banks's Brewery in the 1970s. Note the piece of patterned enamel in front of the fire and also the tiny cupboard in the wall to the left of the fireplace. It is believed this was for gentlemen to store their hats - very useful it was is raining as the heat from the fire dried them out. Fixed wall bench seating looks like it dates from the 1930s. \r\n\r\nTo the left is the small snug with a modern tiled floor and dado panelling. An old, possibly 1930s fireplace has an interior replaced in the 1970s. The original entrance to this room was from an external door on the left - the vestibule / part glazed partitions around the lobby are visible in the public bar. It is highly likely this room was brought into use as a public room later than the other two. On the right accessed by a door in the main lobby or through a gap cut in the dividing wall is another small low ceilinged room. It also has a modern tiled floor, old fireplace with a 1970s Banks's fireplace and a mantelshelf that almost reaches the ceiling, old dado panelling. The two sections of bench seating could date from the early 20th century. The present landlady is allowing non customers to use the car park on payment of a donation to the local Air Ambulance which has raised over \u00a38,000 but owners Marstons have plans to sell most of the land that makes up the car park!",

On the front left is the small lounge with an old baffle by the door, original fixed seating all around the room, a classic 1950/60s tiled fireplace with a gas fire in front, lots of Britannia tables and an etched window with the word 'Room', the \u2018Smoke\u2019 having been lost. At the rear left is the games room with a modern tiled floor, original fixed seating with leatherette covering from the 1960s, and another classic 1950/60s tiled fireplace with a Canon Gas Miser fire. The door has a button on which the number has been painted over. \r\n\r\nThe tiny narrow public bar on the right has one 'Vaults' etched window (another is lost), original bar back shelves and lower cabinet, bar counter and fixed seating but the Formica bar top and tiled and wood surround fireplace come from the 1960s and tiled floor is new. You will usually find a band of faithful regulars sitting and chatting. The old gas mantle by the servery was last used about 30 years ago. Historically, pubs were exclusively for men drinking together and there was therefore no need for a ladies toilet. However, as ladies started to use pubs provision had to be made for them. The outside gents' are still in use (they have been upgraded) and the ladies' here is a conversion of the former back kitchen, which took place in post-war times. Opens at 7.30 ('But might be later if something good on the TV' says Sid 'when it might be later'.) Closes at 10pm Thursday evening \u2013 Sid\u2019s early night to bed! Closed Mon to Sat lunchtimes; Sunday 12.30 to 3.30.",

        "Pub Name": "Cock",
        "Address": "Lavenham Rd (A1141), Brent Eleigh, CO10 9PB",
        "Description": "This attractive thatched wayside 18th-century pub\u00a0retains its two room and off sales layout. The pink rendering conceals a timber-frame which could be older.\u00a0Greene King bought it from the local landowning Coleman family around 1912. Its little altered interior results from\u00a0being run by some long serving licensees such as the Beere family who had\u00a0it for 50 years. The most\u00a0famous of its former licensees is Sam Potter who ran it for 20 years until 1989 and the pub is still called \u2018Potter\u2019s Bar\u2019 by some locals! When he retired, Greene King wanted to sell the pub as a private house but a campaign by locals persuaded them to sell it as a pub. When Charles and Liz Lydford bought it saying they would give it 6 months to prove viable otherwise it would become their home, Sam encouraged locals to use it,\u00a0one of the main reasons why this small unspoilt pub remains open. Although not named, the Cock was given the title of 'The Perfect Pub' in the 1989 book of the same name by Nick & Charlie Hurt, and it is easy to see why.\n\r\nThe small \u2018old bar\u2019 on the right has its own front door and is also accessed via a narrow door from the main left hand bar. It has a small bar counter with genuinely old woodwork, and a set of old bar back shelves with a till drawer in it. This small quarry tiled floored room has a low tongue and groove panelled ceiling, old wooden panelling in the dado around the room with bare wall benches attached on the left wall side, an old bench on the right near the servery and a small shelf to rest your drinks, a large scrubbed table, and an old fireplace with a fine wood surround with what looks like 1930s brick interior.\n\r\nThe main bar on the left is accessed from the corner door and has a quarry tiled floor, a 1930s brick fireplace with a coal fire and seating consisting\u00a0of two basic bare benches, an assortment of chairs and a few bar stools. The only changes to the interior took place in 1976 - previously service here was via a hatch. Half of the present servery was originally taken up by the off sales, but the reduced off sales area still remains with its twin doors for service to the left and is entered by a side door further from the road. The counter and bar-back shelves in the main public bar date from 1976.\n\r\nIn the end of one of the benches is a hole that is the rare pub game of Tossing The Penny. New licensee James Davis has purchased thirteen\u00a0George III ounce pennies to bring the game back into use. Note that on the large scrubbed table is carved an early form of shove ha'penny. The outside gents' and ladies\u2019 toilets are still in service. The Cock is a rare outlet for the locally produced Castlings Heath Cottage Organic draught cider, which is described as \u2018very dry\u2019.",

        "Pub Name": "Nutshell",
        "Address": "17 The Traverse, Bury St. Edmunds, IP33 1BJ",
        "Description": "The tiniest pub in the country* at a mere\u00a04.6m x\u00a02.5m internally. The three-storied building itself is probably early- to mid- C19 and is timber-framed and rendered. It is very shop-like with large windows enabling you to see the whole of the interior without stepping over the threshold! It contains an old counter and bar back shelves; seating is on bare benches attached to an old panelled dado painted brown. The question is - how many people can you get into the Nutshell. The answer is 102 plus a dog called 'Blob', all of whom set a new record on 10 March 1984, beating the previous record by one.\n\r\nThe history of the pub is told in an excellent little book by Gerry Nixon called Old Inns and Beerhouses of Bury St Edmunds and published by the West Suffolk Branch of CAMRA in 1996 (revised edition 2002) - highly recommended, a cut above most pub books. The property, previously a newsagent's, was taken over by a John Stebbing in 1873 when it opened as a beerhouse. This was only one side of the Stebbing family's business interests as they\u00a0also had a greengrocers and a pawnbrokers. John senior ran the greengrocers and his son the Nutshell. Asdid\u00a0 many other pubs,\u00a0it boasted a collection of curiosities including cork models made by John H Stebbing and a stuffed three-legged chicken. On display is a 400 year old mummified cat found behind the fireplace in 1935 - they were believed to\u00a0ward\u00a0off evil spirits from houses. The Stebbings gave up the pub in 1893 and from then until 1934 there were just two landlords.\n\r\nThere is just one toilet - a WC up the narrow staircase on the first floor. Ask to see the visitors book. A\u00a0number of 'smallest pub' souvenirs are on sale.\n\r\n* Other claimants are the Smiths Arms, Godmanstone, Dorset but this has been closed for some years; the Lakeside, Southport, which was recently extended; and the Signal Box Inn, Cleethorpes which\u00a0claims\u00a0to be the smallest pub on the planet with a floor area of just 2.4m x 2.4m.",

        "Pub Name": "Margaret Catchpole",
        "Address": "Cliff Lane, Ipswich, IP3 0PQ",
        "Description": "A very precious survival. Built in 1936 by the local Cobbold Brewery, this pub is the very embodiment of everything that inter-war pub builders were looking for. Refined architecture, restrained, elegant furnishings with the added bonus of sporting facilities. What's more, it is absolutely intact and as such one of only a handful left in the country. This remarkable brick-built pub draws on vernacular traditions with large, sweeping roofs, and prominent dormers and chimney stacks and presents a varied, asymmetrical fa\u00e7ade to the road.\n\r\nThe interior consists of three unaltered rooms plus an off-sales compartment. The wall-panelling\u00a0and bar counters are exactly as they were in the 1930s and the stock shelving has only suffered minor alteration to accommodate\u00a0coolers and other late C20 serving needs. As you come in by the main entrance the off-sales is facing you. It is intact with panelled walls, parquet floor and a solid bar counter;\u00a0there is a '3' on the inside of the door but the tiny room is now only used for storage. Turn left and you enter\u00a0the spacious public bar, the bay window of which overlooks the bowling green. This\u00a0has a parquet floor, a curving counter and an elegant stone fireplace. One small change has been made - the gents' on the right/saloon side was originally outside and in the mid-1970s a small link was added.\n\r\nOn the right is the smaller saloon with 'Saloon' in glazing in the door and its own small, quadrant-shaped bar counter but nowadays it is only opened for meetings and events. The panelling here is the fielded style which is very common in inter-war pubs and there is another polished stone fireplace with a coal fire in it. Note the bell-pushes in the panelling - that nearest the bar counter still works. The annunciator box for the system with 'Public Bar', 'Smoke Room', 'Retail' and 'Saloon' windows is situated above the door for staff to the right side of the counter by the flap - as a bell rings a small disc in one of the windows moves from side to side showing where service is required.\n\r\nAt the rear comes the smoke room, again with a curved counter and a bar-back with its original cupboard and drawers. This large room has a wood-block floor and\u00a0another different pattern adorns the panelled walls here. The bay window has a bare bench all the way round, bell-pushes and a polished stone fireplace. The reason for two doors into the smoke room is\u00a0that one was the door to the outside gents', which is still there and separate from those for the public bar. Note the 'Ladies Cloakroom' sign on the door to the toilet.\n\r\nOn the left hand side is a bowling green, still in use with a club running eight teams. The bowling green was added in 1948 and is subject to a separate lease from Admiral Taverns. A lovely verandah at the back outside the smoke room enables people to watch the play. Opens at 2pm Mon to Fri.",

        "Pub Name": "King's Head",
        "Address": "Gorams Mill Lane, Laxfield, IP13 8DW",
        "Description": "A superlative, unspoilt country pub including one of the most remarkable public bars anywhere that is unchanged in 150 years. This is one of only six traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; and Manor Arms, Rushall, West Midlands.\n\r\nThe origins of the building lie in the C16 and it was extended on the left in the C18. It is timber-framed and plastered, with the plaster lined to imitate stonework. Its unspoilt nature is as a result of being run by the Felgate family from 1882 until 1979. Adnams owned the pub from 1904, when they purchased Fisher's Brewery estate, until they sold it in 1972 (it had closed in 1969). It closed again in 1991 but\u00a0Tony Harvey of Tannington Hall and 8 other local people formed a consortium to buy the pub and they sold it back to Adnams in 2001. In 2016 Adnams leased the pub to a local catering company and, sadly, the leaseholders added the ubiquitous 'gastro' pastel shades of paint to wood panelling and fireplaces. After this company decided they no longer wished to lease the pub, it was put up for sale by Adnams and in 2018 \u00a0was purchased by The Low House Community Interest Company (CIC), a group of regulars who clubbed together to buy the freehold. Thankfully, they have carefully restored the woodwork.\n\r\nThe front doorway leads into the Settle Room, quite a large room with a red and black quarry tiled floor that was originally\u00a0the parlour of the house. Nothing has changed in 150 years with the room dominated by high Victorian settles on three sides and focused on the log fire with a mantelshelf almost reaching the ceiling; note the trivet for placing a joint of meat on for roasting over the hearth and on either side cupboards for keeping things warm and dry. There is a scrubbed top table but no food is served here. The backs of the settles with iron stays attached to the ceiling in fact define a corridor which runs right round the room and has an old basic bench. There really is nothing quite like this room anywhere else and is undoubtedly the core of the public house.\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, Yorkshire, West;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; and Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\n\r\nOn the right a latch door leads to the Card Room, a room of considerable age in the 16th century part of the building which would have been the kitchen of the house. It has a black and red quarry tiled floor, fixed seats all around the room attached to the old tongue and groove dado panelled walls, an old (now disused) wood surround fireplace and just two scrubbed tables. On the long table \u00a0you will see markings that relate to a Far Eastern game called \u2018Go\u2019.\n\r\nBehind this is the Tap Room with a red and black quarry tiled floor which was possibly brought into use at a later date. It consists of a three-sided pew seating around a large scrubbed table, plain panelling and a tongue & groove and panelled ceiling; opposite this is a large multi-drawed old cupboard which is the storage place for crisps and nuts.\n\r\nBehind this in turn, is the servery which is in fact the cellar with a concrete screeded floor and casks of beer on stillage and no counter, but it is here that you come to place your order and the beer is served direct from casks on stillage. As you enter look on the right for the wooden structure that was an early servery, now with some modern shelves. In the cellar are a couple of old Adnams enamel signs advertising their bottled beers and Tally Ho. Here is one of the few modern items in the pub \u2013 a fridge for bottles.\n\r\nAt the end of the passage around the settles through a low doorway and over a small step is a small lobby with uneven brick floor leading to the Dining Room in the rear left hand part of the pub. The dining room was originally the living room and brought into use in 1992 to meet expanded trade. This room has good but modern settle seating and scrubbed tables in keeping with the rest of the pub and a genuine early 20th century tiled and cast fireplace. Note the old bell in the rear left of the settle room / at the end of the passage \u2013 it is still wired up and was used for table service in the dining room but this is no longer the case so ringing the bell is more of an irritation nowadays. On the wall above the fireplace where you will find a couple of ropes that ring the bell are painted the following \u201cPull the chord, Ring the bell, Give the landlord merry hell.\u201d And \u201cAfore ye sit upon the bench, Pull the chord to call a wench, She\u2019ll bring a Jug, Your thirst to quench\u201d.\n\r\nAs befits a pub as unspoilt as this the toilets are outside.",

        "Pub Name": "Mountain Daisy",
        "Address": "150 Hylton Road, Sunderland, Millfield, SR4 7XT",
        "Description": "A large, imposing pub rebuilt in 1900-2 as a hotel by the local architects, William & T.R. Milburn for W B Reid & Co Limited, brewers and wine & spirit merchants of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is a three-storey red brick building with stone dressings and a black marble facing on the ground floor. It has a square corner tower, a series of giant shaped gables, an oriel window and tall chimney-stacks. It has a slightly Queen Anne revival style emphasised by a metal plaque on the west facade with an impression of a mountain daisy; also '1901' in stone. When built it had a long front bar divided into three separate sections, two rear sitting rooms, a news room (now the kitchen) and two family departments. \r\n\r\nOne of a number of impressive Edwardian pubs built in Sunderland (another is the Heritage pub the Dun Cow in the town centre), it retains some original windows but has been substantially altered inside. However, the Sitting Room on the rear left, which was converted into a Buffet Bar, remains intact and is one of the most spectacular pub rooms anywhere in the country. It is visual feast of ceramic work made by Craven Dunnill & Co. of Jackfield, Shropshire, one of the leading manufacturers of the day. The walls are tiled from floor to ceiling with a dado of floral tiles with bands of green tiling and one of brown, then yellow tiles in relief up to a frieze of large floral tiles in pink, cream and green with a deep cornice with brackets picked out in a pale brown colour. It has wonderful display of mosaic covering the floor. \r\n\r\nThere is a stunning quarter circle ceramic bar counter faced with green and yellow faience in an animal head pattern with a marble top and is one of only fourteen remaining in the whole of the UK. Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant.\r\n\r\nCraven Dunnill also specialised in tile pictures and here there are seven of them depicting north-eastern scenes - one of the most impressive displays of tiled paintings in any pub in the UK. They picture, from left to right, the Tyne and High Level Bridge, Newcastle; Durham Cathedral; Wearmouth Bridge, Sunderland; Finchale Abbey, near Durham; Marsden Rock with its grotto, Bamburgh Castle, Cragside House, Rothbury - the bridges being a celebration of the shipping that brought contemporary prosperity to the Tyne and Wear.  The vessel in the Tyne painting is the HMS Victoria, seemingly being towed after initial fitting out at Elswick. She had been sunk off Lebanon in 1893. The wreck survives, stuck vertically in the seabed due to the weight of the single turret forward. It was the most serious Victorian naval disaster with the loss of 358 sailors, after being rammed by HMS Camperdown during naval formation manoeuvres, due to a miscalculation by Admiral Tryon. She was launched in 1887 and completed in 1889. Other magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at \r\nCaf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; \r\nGeneral Havelock, Hastings, East Sussex; \r\nCentral Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; \r\nRose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; \r\nSt James Tavern, Soho, London W1\nDolphin, Hackney, London E8;\r\nand\r\nGolden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nOther original fittings in the Buffet Bar include a floral tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace with a mirror in surround above, and three stained glass window screens showing scenes of eating and drinking, but any fixed seating was removed in late 1980s. If the snug is closed ask staff and they will open it up for you. The entrance on Cromwell Street leads into a fine vestibule with stained and leaded panels up to the ceiling. On the servery side of the screen is a blocked up hatch with a figure '1' above, which was the family department (off sales). There are broken pediments above most doorways.  \r\n\r\nThe main bar was refitted in the 1970s but you can still see the remains of the two vestibule entrances on the Hylton Road side with stained and leaded panels - the left hand side one is blocked up with the right hand side one is in use; also good stained and leaded top lights above plain front windows. Some old dado panelling remains, now painted brown. The front bar is now L-shaped having absorbed the second sitting room and family department. All other fittings are modern.  \r\n\r\nAt quiet times it may be possible to visit upstairs but best to ring ahead (0191 597 7261) to arrange. A staircase with good newel post leads to a first floor landing where there are two good exterior stained and leaded windows. Through a pair of screens with double doors and stained and leaded panels above you will find the former billiard room on the front of the building. Now a large function room, which is in use for Sunday lunches, it has a barrel vaulted ceiling, two skylights - one still with original etched panels - and pilasters, enhanced Corinthian in style, running all the way around the top part of the ceiling, 25 in all. There are also Corinthian pilasters from the two original tiled and wood surround fireplace mantelshelves up to cornice level at the base of the barrel section.  \r\n\r\nThe two grand fireplaces have cast iron surrounds, decorative lintels and featuring a cartouche made of tin. This large room still retains its original bar fittings of a protruding panelled bar counter and fine three-bay bar back fitting with central pediment, bevelled mirror panels and pillars holding up the shelves. The letter box at the top is an S&N addition to show the till amount. There is also a dining room on the first floor with no old fittings. Gents on first floor has brown and white tiled floor, colourful tiled dado and old urinal. \r\n\r\nSome detail from The Northumbrian Pub by Lynn F. Pearson",

        "Pub Name": "Dun Cow",
        "Address": "High Street West, Sunderland, City Centre, SR1 3HA",
        "Description": "In 2014 the Dun Cow was purchased by the Sunderland Music Arts and Culture (MAC) Trust, whose aim is to create a cultural hub around the Edwardian Quarter of the city, which incorporates the Sunderland Empire, the Dun Cow and the old fire station. After a three month closure for a careful restoration the pub has been leased to the Head of Steam chain of pubs and reopened selling a wide range of real ales. \r\n\r\nRe-built in 1901-2, this three-storey pub of Edwardian baroque has two Dutch gables and a corner copper domed tower which houses two clocks. The impressive exterior has stone carvings including '1901' and 'RD Ltd' for Robert Deuchars, Brewers of Edinburgh; it was designed by architect Benjamin F Simpson. It is one of a number of impressive Edwardian pubs built in Sunderland (another is the Heritage pub the Mountain Daisy in the Millfield area. Above the three doorways are decorative stonework including figures of a cat, a cow, a frog and a lizard - can you find them? \r\n\r\nFrom the entrance on High Street West is a vestibule entrance with etched panels in it. There is a passage from which the ladies leads off - when built this was the Managers Room. The left hand side partition wall has both stained and leaded also decoratively etched panels and a door for staff (was this the original off sales?). A further door on the left leads to the large public bar with panelled walls including some bevelled mirrors and fine sectioned plasterwork ceiling with very decorative cornice picked out in red, gold and green. The fireplace is a grand affair with a two sectioned mantelpiece held up by pillars but it has a reproduction interior of cast iron and modern tiles. Modern fixed seating. A corner doorway has been filled in and a wall removed to the small smoke room on the side street. \r\n\r\nThe Dun Cow has one of the most stunning bar-backs in Britain which as part of the 2014 refurbishment has been subject to an impressive restoration to remove many years of nicotine stains. Rory F Johnson, Paintings Conservation & Restoration spent some five weeks using a cotton wool swab style of instrument to return the colour back to the original off-white colour. The back fitting, which has been recently lacquered, is a splendid traceried Indo-Gothic web billowing out to form platforms on which bottles can be displayed. It has three sections, divided by semi-circular projections, and is richly decorated with delicate Art Nouveau-style woodcarving and curious reliefs in plaster in some of the recesses \u2013 look for the figures including a cow\u2019s head.. It has two rows of bevelled mirror sections, two drawers and is topped off with a balustrade and a clock, but the letter box is an S&N addition in the 1970s to show customers the details on the till. Formidable original bar counter with strong detail such as unusual indentations at the top and pilasters all the way along the front. \r\n\r\nA curved screen divides the main bar from the smaller rear sitting room and it has coloured stained and leaded panels in it as well as some decorative etched panels. One panel has been removed from it for access.  In the recent past one of the colourful glass leaded panes had been destroyed and in the refurbishment of 2014 a very accurate replacement has been made to make the screen complete once again. Can you spot which of the 4 panes on the window side is the replacement one? From the door on Garden Place there is a vestibule entrance with 'Smoke Room' etched panel. The original plans show that the present room is an amalgamation of a much smaller sitting room and a small Hall i.e. the right hand part of the wall separating them has been removed in modern times. In the former Hall area is another original bar counter front with service via a hatch or door to the servery. This small room has another good cornice picked out in red, gold and green, some panelling, the odd bevelled mirror, a Victorian reproduction tiled & cast iron fireplace and modern fixed seating. \r\n\r\nThe outside gents' have been covered over in recent years. As part of the refurbishment of 2014 the first floor has been refitted and a new but quality bar fittings added including a counter with a tiled panel on the front. The first floor is open to the public from 12 noon to 8pm on Saturday; for a Blues Club on Fridays from 8.30pm to close; and is also available for functions. Hidden away on the top floor (not accessible to the public) is another fine original bar back fitting with bevelled mirror sections and a canopy held up by pillars but no bar counter. \r\n\r\nSources: Pearson, Lynn F.

        "Pub Name": "King & Queen",
        "Address": "13-17 Marlborough Place, Brighton, BN1 1UB",
        "Description": "Rebuilt in 1931 this stunning brewers\u2019 Tudor pub has sadly lost its main room division so on entry you see an open-plan interior with a vast high ceiling at the rear like a medieval baron\u2019s hall on a Hollywood stage set! Currently operating as a sports bar you will see large TV screens and TV's everywhere so we recommend a visit at a quiet time to fully appreciate the amazing interior. \r\n\r\nBrighton based Edlins Ltd. - their name is carved above the door - acquired the former hotel on this site in 1909 and in 1931 employed local architects Clayton & Black to build what was described at the time as \u2018a gorgeous flight of architectural imagination\u2019. This is immortalised in the exterior, which is worth a thorough inspection prior to entering the pub. The spectacular frontage statues of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn welcoming you over the entrance. The royal pair also feature on plasterwork on the left bay and on a painted panel on the right. In the high-pitched red tile roof are three smaller half-timbered gables, while the right bay of the main building has a double gable, the lower with shield decoration projecting from the battlemented wall of the upper. To the right the gatehouse was added in 1935-6.\r\n\r\nInterior design was the responsibility of Ashley Tabb, of Heaton, Tabb & Co. Ltd, who created a large left-side saloon that replicated a Tudor dining hall, and a public bar on the right that was intended to represent a soldiers and retainers dining hall and kitchens. The most important change is the loss of a screen dividing the ground floor into two \u2013 it ran at the foot of the central staircase but was removed c.1967. The bar counter is original but the bar back fittings looks like one from the late 1960s with what looks like a letter box at the top - it was added by Watneys for an extension from the till so customers could clearly see the cost of rounds. Also gone is the Ladies\u2019 Parlour with its corner fireplace and chimney funnel carving of Henry and his wives. An old photograph suggests its position to have been at the front-left of the pub where the window glass looks modern. \r\n\r\nRemaining little altered at the rear left is a small panelled room (originally a billiard room) with a red tiled floor and flat-arched fireplace with decorative Dutch tiles under a carved mantelshelf and some window-panes decorated with designs in yellow stain remains at the rear left. Three stairways lead to Prinny's bar, an upper-level minstrel's gallery (open to the hall) and a second enclosed bar, which is now used as a pool room. Stained-glass panels to staircase window depict a Spenserian knight and a damsel with a hawk in a more pictorial style than the rest. Stained glass helps foster the Tudor illusion and the staircase to gallery has ornate square newels. The Gallery has a Tudor-arched fireplace with painted shields over; some window-panes decorated with emblems in yellow stain, and quasi-heraldic and emblematic designs to toplights. \r\n\r\nSo we still have a vast high-ceilinged Tudor hall evoking romantic images of a mythical Merrie England. The stout oak doorways, castellated brick supporting column, flat-arched open fireplaces and decoration of royal portraits, armoury, tapestry, heraldic shields and flags of St George the Tudor fantasy lives on virtually undiminished over seven decades after it creation. There is a modern addition over the servery of an ugly balcony called 'The Royal Box', incorporating a seating area above the bar which can be booked for groups, and the pub kitchen beneath which has a big impact on the room. Recently the impressive toilets have been modernised and their original white and blue very 1930s tiling replaced. They are accessed downstairs through Tudor arches at each end of the bar marked 'cloakrooms' and both ladies\u2019 and gents\u2019 run nearly the full length of the great hall. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the building a former garage and shops were demolished in 1935-6 and erected in their place was a lengthy gatehouse supported on brick pillars, with a lower roof line than the main pub. Half-timbered with herringbone brickwork and portcullis, this provided a stagey entrance into an open air galleried courtyard with fountain and pond. The latter have since been paved over but other very striking original architectural detailing survives. The white tiling on the walls under the covered seating depicts a delightful range of medieval characters while a delightful large tile panel, signed by an artist from Delft, shows asteam launch passing Windsor Castle. The courtyard is a delightful place to sit with a grape and vine motif in bold purple, orange and green running along the frieze on the right. \r\n\r\nOverlooking the courtyard is the first floor Tudor Room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling apart from one bay to south; a flat-arched hearth with bracketed mantelshelf, the brackets in the form of carved heads and the shelf carved with interlaced foliage and beasts; painted emblems on chimney breast; panelled doors with grilles to south. The ladies toilet overhangs the courtyard and has a colourful scorpion window - exterior-wise there are a number of carved figures. Originally planned as a family room in this 'improved' public house it is now used for functions. \nEdlins were typical of a now largely vanished type of firm which was active in beer bottling (not just Guinness, Bass and Worthington \u2013 the beers which were bottled by small concerns all over the country \u2013 but a range of \u2018own label\u2019 beers which were contract-brewed for them), wine and spirit retailing and pub ownership. They owned a number of pubs around Brighton; the firm must have been pretty well off judging by the King and Queen.",

        "Pub Name": "New Inn",
        "Address": "Main Road, Hadlow Down, TN22 4HJ",
        "Description": "Following years of uncertainty with the land behind the pub being sold for development there is now a positive situation for the future of the public bar and the tiny snug for which the pub is included here. In March 2012 Wealden Council granted planning permission to extend and refurbish the New Inn. However, these plans were not carried out except that the left/hotel side of the property, which had been disused for many years, has been refurbished and is now used for functions, wakes, christenings, meetings etc. The pub continues to trade as a drinkers pub. \r\n\r\nThis red-brick hotel-cum-pub built in 1885 for the South Down & East Grinstead Brewery retains its plan-form and fittings virtually intact. The central entrance has 'Hotel Entrance' etched glass in the doors. On the right under a projecting brick canopy which rises to a crow-stepped gable with central pinnacle are a pair of doors leading to the public bar with one remaining 'Public Bar' etched panel. The locals are interested in replacing the other panel which was accidentally broken in recent years. \r\n\r\nOn the inside of the door note the ceramic button with the figure '1' above the inside of the front doors - a requirement of licensing magistrates. The pub part is small with a long public bar fronting the main street (there was probably a screen dividing it originally) and an elliptical arch rests on fluted console brackets halfway down the length of the room. There is also a small room behind. Recently both have been tidied and repainted but no other changes made. \r\n\r\nThe spartan public bar fittings are much as they were in Victorian times with a wood-block floor, a long Victorian panelled counter with the front painted cream, original bar back fitting with three large cash drawers (note two slots for notes) and four ceramic spirit barrels (note \u2018I Whisky\u2019 from the days before the fad of inserting an \u2018e\u2019 to distinguish the Irish from the Scottish variety). The bar back fitting has been thoroughly rubbed down. There are two sections of wall bench seating attached to matchboard dado panelling and a small early 20th century tiled fireplace with decoration on the wood surround and with a log fire. There is a piano which is still played occasionally.\r\n\r\nAt the rear right is the snug, a small room which now has a carpet, the matchboard dado panels have been painted white and service is via the original split doors with a hatch/shelf to the back of the bar. The fireplace has been removed from the room but it will be re-instated. The jukebox is no longer in use \u2013 this is a pub with no modern features such as TV, radio, pool etc. and the only food is local good value pork pies, pickled eggs, crisps etc. \u2013 good conversation and good beer is the attraction here! This is a pub that still puts bites on the bar on a Sunday lunchtime \u2013 roast potatoes and roast parsnips cooked on the premises! \r\n\r\nOn the front left side of the building are twin currently out of use doors with \u2018Hotel Entrance\u2019 etched panels which lead into a corridor and off to the left is the former dining room with further matchboard panelling and an ornate cast-iron fireplace. The left hand room has been re-decorated and is in use for functions at present. For service customers are served in the corridor through the lower pane of the sash-windowed hatch situated on the left of the servery which can be raised but otherwise is closed. \r\n\r\nThe pub still retains its outside gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019. The pub opens at 6pm Mon to Fri; 12 noon Sat, Sun and bank holidays.",

        "Pub Name": "Havelock",
        "Address": "27 Havelock Road, Hastings, TN34 1BP",
        "Description": "This pub is included as a Heritage Pub only for its exceptional tiled paintings, described by the Tiles & Architectural Ceramics Society as \"This wonderful interior must be amongst the candidates for the best turn-of-the-century pub tile scheme in Britain. It certainly stands comparison with Sunderland\u2019s Mountain Daisy, where the 1900-2 tiling (with seven picture panels and a ceramic bar counter) is by Craven Dunnill.\u201d Other magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Caf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; St James TavernDolphin, Hackney, London E8;andGolden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nBuilt c.1857 as a small town centre hotel, the date of the death of General Havelock, this is a four-story building in Italianate style. It was refitted in 1889-90 by a local architect Ward with murals by Royal Doulton artists. Although now just one room, it has one of the finest displays of tiled paintings anywhere in the UK. The east side wall is completely covered in tiles and in the upper part are three Royal Doulton panels depicting Hastings Castle, the Battle of Hastings and a sea engagement between three vessels including the Hastings vessel Conqueror and a French pirate ship. Colourful tiled panels with a floral design on the left and right of each painting. The lower part includes small ceramic panels \"The Battle of Hastings.A.D.1066\"; \"Hastings Castle\"; and \"English Fishermen Boarding a French Pirate\". \r\n\r\nAlso in the right hand porch on Havelock Street side there is a fine Royal Doulton panel depicting General Havelock sitting astride a white horse.  Below the painting are more tiles and a small ceramic panel 'General Havelock'. On a tile to the bottom right of all the paintings is the detail \"This Tiling was Executed by Alfred T S Carter, Brockley, London SE\" (but can't be spotted alongside the Hastings Castle one as it and part of the tiled painting is obscured by some wood panels). Carters (later Poole Pottery) may have commissioned the murals and they are thought to be the work of either John Eyre or John H McClennan. \r\n\r\nOriginally a passageway ran through the pub from the disused left hand door on Havelock Street to the present entrance on Robertson Street as identified by the black and white tiling on the floor near the tiled paintings and there are mosaic 'The Havelock' on the Havelock Street end and 'Havelock' on the Robertson Street end. A partition would have separated the passage from the rest of the interior which would have been divided by further partitions into probably three separate rooms each accessed by a door in the partition. The two short partitions attached to the tiled wall look modern. On Havelock Road side there is a late C19 pub front with elliptical bowed centre and etched glass flanked by tiled pilasters to left and right. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to date the panelled bar counter but the barley twist columns and super structure are definitely modern. There are two different bar back fittings either side of a modern dumb waiter in the centre - the right hand bar back fitting is a quality one with mirrored panels and again difficult to date whereas the left hand section is of a totally different design and definitely post-war; some lower shelves have been lost for fridges. The whole room has a very good boarded ceiling with lozenge-shaped ribs.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nFormerly a pub interior of National Importance the pub was built in 1953 and up to 2007 it was virtually intact with five rooms.\n\nThe 2007 refurbishment involved removing a front dividing wall and left only the bar counter in the rear right room, and dado panelling in a number of rooms as the only remaining original fittings. \nOriginal Description prior to 2007\n\nHuge tile hung and brick built estate pub built in 1953 that is virtually unaltered, apart from modern tiling in the toilets. There are five rooms including a downstairs ballroom, intact jug and bottle still with its counter, but now used as a store. \n\nThe lobby on the right has a terrazzo floor and walls with a gents off to the right. The small bar at the front right has a dado of fielded panelling, a decorative cornice and original slanting bar counter on a terrazzo step but the stone fireplace looks like a replacement. There are double doors with side panels between two rooms that have multi-bevelled glass panels and stained & leaded panel above. The larger bar at the rear right has a dado of fielded panelling, a skylight, slanting original bar counter on a cream terrazzo step, original multi-mirrored bar back, a hatch to the kitchen at the back of the bar, but no fireplace. \n\nThe lobby on the left has a terrazzo floor and walls with a gents off to the left. A terrazzo passageway goes around to the left and houses an organ. The door on the right with the figure '4' on the inside leads into the Smoke Room on the front left and has panelling to picture frame height, original slanted bar counter on a green terrazzo step, original bar back with multi-mirrored panels, original bench seating with cushions, good cornice, but a new stone fireplace. Larger Lounge at the rear right is rarely open and has an original counter and bar back, good cornices (which are different to those in the bar) and skylight but new seating and a centre feature fireplace i.e. looks new. \n\nAt the rear of the pub is a veranda with a brick balustrade which overlooks the garden and nearby housing on a much lower level - note the ceramic discs which are pilgrim motifs above the windows to the veranda on the right side. Underneath the veranda is the entrance to the Ballroom which has been altered recently and is still used for functions. It has lots of leaded windows - note the stone flowers and leaves on the exterior around the windows and Tudor shaped doors into bars.",

        "Description": "Tucked away rural classic with no bar as such - you are served beer drawn direct from the cask via two hatches / doorways. The pretty Victorian red-brick and tile-hung exterior with latticed leaded windows conceals an eighteenth-century, if not earlier, structure. The place has grown with outbuildings at the back and the late nineteenth-century extension on the left. The public area used to be much smaller because the left-hand rooms are relatively new additions, having been taken in from private quarters in c.1973 (front ) and c.1986 (rear).  \r\n\r\nThe front latch door leads into a splendid old room on the right - the real focus of this unspoilt pub. It is small with an uneven bare brick floor, exposed beams and inglenook brick fireplace with bare benches either side and wood burner. The simple seating includes four scrubbed pine tables, wall bench seating on the left and front walls, three basic low benches and a settle - sadly the old curved settle as shown in photos and drawings on the wall has gone to be replaced by a modern one with a straight back. Originally it appears to have consisted of two rooms which were knocked together when the pub was established about a century ago. Originally service seems to have been at a tiny hatch to the right of the present doorway-cum-hatch.  \r\n\r\nA short stone-flagged corridor to the left leads to another small room with a doorway, parquet floor, dado panelling that may date from c.1973 when it became a pub room, marble surround cast-iron fireplace (electric fire), and a bar billiards table which is usually covered over. The old wall cupboards on the right of the fireplace confirm this was part of the private quarters.  \r\n\r\nA part flagstone and part concrete passage runs from between the front two rooms and leads to the rear there are two more rooms. The rear left small room has a carpet, an early 20th century glazed brick and cast-iron fireplace (disused) and recent dado panelling. There are two sections of built-in old cupboards confirming this room was also a domestic one until c.1986.   \r\n\r\nThe original second room is a much smaller one at the rear right with a carpet, panelled ceiling and a doorway-cum-hatch to the servery. The cellar with its panelled ceiling is best viewed from there. There are casks on stillage and some old shelves above and on the right but those on the left are modern and the ubiquitous fridge has been added.  \r\n\r\nBoth ladies and gents toilets are outside on the right of the building and look like they were added in the 1930s with its Crittal windows.",

        "Description": "A three-storey wedge-shaped building dated 1854 by M Thompson for Alderman Potts, local wine merchant. It became a hotel in c.1890 and still retains a superb intact 'Buffet Bar', the reason for its inclusion as a Heritage Pub. \r\n\r\nThe Buffet Bar entrance is half way down either side of the building and in the passage the inner door has decorative etched panels, also the door has a 'Buffet' glazed pane. This small room has a bare wood floor, with U-shaped carved original bar counter, very good original decorative carved bar back, original fixed seating, half panelling, etched 'Buffet' glass panel in the rear right door, fine ceiling, and plasterwork frieze with figures of putti, original fixed seating in two sections but no sign of a fireplace. The projection behind the bar-back used to house a dumb waiter running the full height of the building. \r\n\r\nThe sharp angle of the building creates an interestingly shaped room beyond the Buffet Bar with a glazed 'Snug' panel in door, seating around the apex probably of the 1950s and colourful leaded lights. The bare boarded public bar has new bar fittings which replaced ones installed in the 1950s. It is said that there used to be drinking cubicles in this area originally. This room has a good panelled segmented ceiling, some full-height fielded panelling, \"The Central\" cut glass panels in the inner twin doors, and an old bench with '....' carved into it and a makers label. \r\n\r\nOn the staircase in the hallway there is walnut half-height panelling running up the staircase and around the first-floor landing. On the first floor the Blue Room has old dado panelling painted light blue and there is an old bench, possibly from the public bar. It is in use for bands on Sunday from 4pm to 7pm. The Red Room has three pieces of old red leatherette benches also from the public bar, a modern bar has been added and is now the pool room. On the second floor is a smoking terrace and room with a modern bar. \r\n\r\nThe Buffet Bar has recently been re-styled as the Whisky Lounge' and is open Friday & Saturday evenings from 6pm. If you want to visit it at other times bar staff will be happy to open it up for you.",

        "Pub Name": "Crown Posada",
        "Address": "31 Side, Newcastle upon Tyne, Quayside, NE1 3JE",
        "Description": "Rebuilt 1880 (architect W.L. Newcombe) for local brewer John Sanderson, this is a three story pub on a narrow site which retains its three drinking areas, one behind the other. The front windows contain two impressive Pre-Raphaelite style stained glass windows which may be by Birmingham artist Edward Burne-Jones and are believed to have been a later addition. One window depicts a lady serving a drink and the other a Tudor gent about to consume it. Originally the Crown, and renamed Crown Posada, legend has it that the pub was bought by a Spanish sea captain for his mistress (Posada is the Spanish word for resting place). \r\n\r\nOwners since 1901 are the long-established, family-run business Sir John Fitzgerald, who have made a number of careful refurbishments over the years and much of the fixed leather seating, panelling and other woodwork are likely to be true replicas of the originals. In the 1980s they replaced the windows running down the right-hand side, which only overlooked an alley, with a series of mirrors with mahogany surrounds. Behind the wallpaper are some old wall paintings (claimed to date back to the Spanish Civil War) which see the light of day when the pub is re-decorated approximately every 15 years! \r\n\r\nLook for the unusual stone painted blue with carved crown symbol and the word \u2018Posada\u2019 on the exterior and the glazed brick lobby with a wrought-iron \u2018Crown\u2019 gate. The long narrow interior has a high ornate moulded ceiling with deeply recessed panels. There is a delightful small screened-off snug at the front left-hand side which has lost its door. You can order your drinks from the side of the servery but originally this was covered by a curtain and service was via the tiny hinged stained glass window attached to the bar back. The fixed seating is post war. \r\n\r\nThe bar fittings are essentially original but have some modern replacements such as the mirrors and stained & leaded panels on top section on the four-bay mahogany bar-back fitting, and the pot shelf is a later addition. Only recently was permission given to replace a small section of the lower bar-back fitting with a couple of small fridges. The two side panels of the screen that separated the front public bar from the rear sitting room remain and have good colourful leaded pictorial panels at the top but, again, the door has been lost. \r\n\r\nThe last major change was in the early 1950s when new ladies' and gents' toilets were added at the rear (formerly a disused warehouse) and the seating area at the rear was extended slightly. The present fixed seating was likely to have been added in the early 1950s. The gents' has a terrazzo floor and the doors to both the ladies' and gents' are of an inter-war style and, again, could date from the early 1950s. \r\n\r\nMusic comes from a 1941 turntable record player situated on the bar counter and customers are encouraged to bring their vinyl LP's to play.",

His layout remains - two rooms either side of a central entrance lobby where the off-sales hatch and its sliding window survives. Public bar on the left with original bar counter, mirrored bar-back, full height matchboard panelled walls and ceiling. In 2009 an extension to the servery for serving food and drink was created by removing a section of the rear wall and you can now see the cellar behind. The sitting room on the right was refitted in the 1980s and has a hatch to the servery. The interwar period seems to have brought a new brick facing to the ground floor and the six attractive window screens across the front (plus one on the return). Upstairs are some bar fittings from the Haymarket Hotel in Newcastle including a splendid bar-back - they were repositioned in 2009. Live traditional music, real ale and cider are all strong features at this pub.",

At the end of the corridor is the low, beamed public bar which assumed its present arrangements in the 1950s when the bar counter was installed and it was extended into the area on the left-hand side: has a tiled floor, whitewashed walls and an inter-war brick fireplace. Some of the beers were served until about 2008 using a very rare method - cask-pumps attached to the casks stillaged behind the counter. Note the wonderful advertising poster for Lucas, Blackwell & Arkwright's Brewery of Leamington. There was a separate lounge on the other side of the courtyard but it ceased operation in 2005. \r\n\r\nAround 2015 the shelving forming the bar back was renewed and modern wood added to the right hand side of the servery above the casks.

At the rear the smoke room has a another etched panel in the door, original fixed seating with baffles and bell-pushes but the counter was added in the 1960s and replaces a hatch. There is another door with 'Saloon Bar' etched panel in the lobby from Bradford Street and a hatch to the side of the servery. A small room at the rear left has been brought into use.",

        "Pub Name": "White Swan",
        "Address": "276 Bradford Street, Birmingham, Digbeth, B12 0QY",
        "Description": "An ambitious corner-site red brick and terracotta pub of 1899-1900 for Ansells Brewery by James & Lister Lea, retaining most of its floor plan and extensive tile decoration. It is similar in design to the Market Tavern, in nearby Moseley Street built for Holt Brewery at the same time. On the wall of the rear Smoke Room is the history of the pub and, importantly, a plan of the pub dated 1899. This shows only minimal changes \u2013 the loss of two low partitions in the public bar and the addition of a servery in the Smoke Room. The pub has been run by the same family since 1969. \r\n\r\nThe L-shaped public bar sits in the angle of the roads and there is a tiled corridor on the left which enlarges into a drinking/service area with a hatch to the servery. The public bar still retains its original counter with a solid wood top that is a 1989 replacement for a red Formica one from the 1960s. Along the top of the counter front are a number of brass match strikers with the wording 'Beer Engines Bar Fitters Yates Birmingham' and there are heating pipes all along the base forming a foot rail. The original bar back fitting remains with pilasters, mirrored panels and a distinctive balustrade at the top. In refurbishments by Ansells it has been sanded down and re-varnished so it does look more modern. To confirm it is the original take a look at the bar back fitting in the off sales and you will see it is identical in style. \r\n\r\nThe walls above a panelled dado are covered in soft-chocolate shell-patterned relief tiles by Minton\u2019s set lozenge-wise on a beige background topped off by a pretty Minton\u2019s bud and flower frieze in cream, orange, green and crimson. Note the rare copper tile ceiling. The fixed seating is old, but it looks more 1930s than Victorian and has been re-leatheretted. What a pity about the obtrusive modern pot-shelf gantry plonked on the counter. \r\n\r\nIn 1989 a refurbishment saw the removal of a two-thirds height partition that split the public bar into two and the vestibule, which originally had doors to the left and right, around the now disused central entrance was cut down in size. Take a look at the bar counter and you can see where the partition was situated. The vestibule entrance on the right has a door to the left and an etched panel at right angles to it that was originally a door into a tiny snug and again you can see at the base of the counter where the partition, removed many years ago, was originally situated. The plan on the Smoke Room wall also confirms the existence of a small snug when built. Note the colourful stained glass windows \u2013 a feature of many of Birmingham\u2019s Victorian pubs. \r\n\r\nOn the rear right hand side of the pub is the intact off sales accessed via a door on Birchall Street which, amazingly, was still in use up to 2005 to sell soup and sandwiches to workers in nearby factories \u2013 now closed. As you opened the door, still with its 'Outdoor' etched glass panel, it used to ring a bell so staff were aware of a customer. The off sales still retains its Victorian colourful tiled floor, original counter, original mirrored bar back fitting and on the right hand side wall floor to ceiling Minton's tiles. The tiles on the left hand wall were carefully removed as part of the 1989 refurbishment and most are now situated on the left hand wall of the public bar where they replaced damaged tiles. \r\n\r\nLeaving the public bar by the left hand door, which has a letter \u2018C\u2019 on the other side leads into a wonderful tiled passageway running from the left hand exterior door to the toilets at the rear. Usually there are numbers on doors so the letters here are rare (but also found at the Villa Tavern in nearby Nechells), and are the requirements of the licensing magistrates. The inner door has a letter \u2018A\u2019 in it and a decorative \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 etched panel. The passage widens out and it is here that you can enjoy the rare activity of passageway drinking as there is a small table and a hatch with rising plain glass upper window. There is also a door to the servery for staff with a \u2018Private\u2019 decorative etched glass panel in it. \r\n\r\nThe whole of the passageway walls are covered in colourful Minton's tiles \u2013 a dado of mainly olive-green tiles both plain and patterned then various narrow ceramic strips including an attractive one of wreaths and above the dado are buff panels in brown frames surrounded by a row of olive-green tiles. Above is a frieze of flowers with fish tails in cream, green orange, crimson and turquoise. The whole of the passageway has a floor of colourful Victorian tiles and the ceiling is lined in Lincrusta paper. \r\n\r\nOn the rear left a door with the letter \u2018B\u2019 and a modern \u2018Banks\u2019s\u2019 etched glazed panel - Banks\u2019s (now Marstons) bought the pub in 1998 - leads to the Smoke Room. The original floor plan indicates there was no bar here and it had fixed seating so the counter and bar back were added in the 1960s \u2013 previous to that the room was served via a hatch to the back of the servery. Back in 1969 the counter front had carpet on it, now replaced by wood panels, and it has a yellow Formica top on it. The Victorian fireplace could be the original but has modern tiles and there is another tiled frieze. \r\n\r\nThe pub was built with a Club Room upstairs \u2013 accessed from a door on Birchall Street. Although no  longer accessible, the interior lobby from Birchall Street has a floor of colourful Victorian tiles and floor to ceiling tiling. Through the inner door situated in a full height screen there is a passageway also with a floor of colourful Victorian tiles, more floor to ceiling tiling and a tiled arch at the entrance to the hall. If you look behind the servery in the public bar you can see the hall with walls and the staircase to the first floor covered in mainly green Minton's tiles. The Club Room, served from a hatch to the back of the servery, was used for billiards in the 1930s and had a bar added post war but is now private living accommodation.",

        "Description": "Reopened in 2013 after restoration by sympathetic new owners. Built in 1896-7 for Ansells' Brewery, this is one of the finest of the many Birmingham tiled and terracotta pubs designed by James & Lister Lea. It stood, for many years, unloved in an urban wasteland but recent developments around it helped secure its future. The main bar, now one room, but once two split by a partition, is dominated by the splendid bar counter and even grander bar-back. The room has much excellent Minton tiling. To the right is a small drinking corridor, also sumptuously tiled. An angled door leads to the true marvel which is the smoke room, with more glorious wall tiling, a lovely marble fireplace, an old mirror set into the tiles, bench seating all round and a large hatch to the bar with glazed panel above. Returning to the main bar, and ahead of the corner entrance, a snug occupies what had been a plain back room, brought into pub use at a later date.",

        "Pub Name": "Red Lion",
        "Address": "270 Soho Road, Birmingham, Handsworth, B21 9LX",
        "Description": "Built in 1901, it retains a spectacular interior including floor\u2013to-ceiling tiles in passages, ornate bar fittings, four tiled paintings, and panelled \u2018coffee room\u2019. There was a pub on this site in 1829. It was bought up by Holt's Brewery in 1893 and rebuilt eight years later to the designs of James & Lister Lea. This magnificent pub was threatened with demolition in the 1980s to make way for road improvements, but fortunately survived and is still with us. The extravagant exterior is in two shades of terracotta. The interior consists of a superb tiled hall and staircase on the right; a fabulous public bar stretches across the full width of the frontage; a tiled passage on the left leading to the Smoke Room; and a little used Coffee Room. \r\n\r\nThe narrow public bar retains its original bar counter and a magnificent bar back of mahogany and gilded, painted and etched mirrors featuring Holt Brewery lettering and squirrel motifs, which was incorporated into Ansells symbol when they took over Holt Brewery in 1934. The original bench seating along the window side remains and above timbered dados are superb cream, green, blue and gold wall tiles by Minton. On the left side of the pub the passage to the smoke room is particularly fine and has a colourful quarry tiled floor with a disused off sales hatch to the bar. \r\n \r\nThe door to the Smoke Room has a good panel of etched and gilded glass and inside are large framed lithographs - 3 on the left hand side wall, one either side of the fire and another near the hatch to back of the servery. This little used room retains its original fixed bench seating (in need of repair), with service bells, stained and leaded windows and old gas lamp fitting but it has lost its fireplace. On the right is a superb staircase hall, beautifully tiled throughout mainly in cream and turquoise and is lit by stained glass windows. Upstairs function room with etched windows? \r\n\r\nOn the rear right hand side the Coffee Room (again little used) has dark wood panelling all around the walls and framed engravings of paintings 'The Village Wedding', 'Shamrock' (dogs), 'Rannoch Moor', 'Thistle' (more dogs), 'The Mountain Pool' (Bison) - 9 in total, and service bells. There is a tiled and wood surround fireplace with bevelled mirror in the wood surround, original fixed bench seating, 'Coffee Room' in frosted and etched window in the door and a hatch to back of the servery. \r\n\r\nDespite being Grade II-star listed, the pub has suffered from a lack of maintenance and care for many years; it closed in 2008 and is considered 'at risk'. Latest information is that it is likely to reopen as a restaurant, not a pub.",

        "Pub Name": "Bartons Arms",
        "Address": "144 High Street, Birmingham, Newtown, B6 4UP",
        "Description": "The Bartons Arms is one of the most beautiful pubs in the country being full of Victorian splendour. It was threatened with demolition in 1969; altered and restored in 1980; but it struggled to attract trade and closed in 2000, re-opened in February 2003. \r\n\r\nIt was built 1899-1901 by James & Lister Lea (the job architect was a Mr Brassington) and has been described, with some justice, as looking like a small town hall. It is a large wedge-shaped three-storey pub in stone and red brick in a loosely Jacobean style with Dutch shaped gables prominently sited on a corner including a tall square clock tower. The interior is truly spectacular with a magnificent display of tiling by Minton Hollins including a tile-painting. Two bars have original snob screens, which only survive in about ten pubs in the whole of the UK. There is lots of decorative etched glass, a large stained glass window on the staircase and a fine stained and leaded screen. Sadly, the wooden partitions which created three different rooms in the bar and also around the staircase hall were removed in 1969. As a result of alterations and restoration work in the early 1980s it is now possible to walk from room to room through a series of mainly tiled archways. \nA Tour of the Pub \r\n\r\nThe lino-tiled public bar has some large decorative windows with both etched and stained glass, colourful tiled walls, a partly sloping floor and two splendid vestibule entrances with 'The Bartons Arms' mosaic floors. Look for the old barometer over one of the exterior doors. One of the four (now confusingly named) 'Lounge' windows in the doors has been replaced - can you spot which one ? Try running you hand over the windows on the 'sloping side' of the room and you will realise one has a shallower cut. If you look up in the middle of the room you will see a column with a colourful fleur-de-lys capital. The bar back has two decorative gilded mirrors in the centre and three bevelled mirror panels either side, one of which on the sloping / Potters Lane side is a recent replacement - can you spot which one ? The carved bar counter has a range of Oakham ales as well as guest beers. Also on sale are a number of specialty bottled beers, mainly Belgian strong ales - ask for the menu! \r\n\r\nThrough an arch you reach a small room where the bar was slightly moved in 1980. It still has its rare snob screens and cut glass panels going right up to the ceiling above. The bar front here is not what it first appears to be as it is actually fibreglass panels made to look like original tiles ! The walls have genuine tiles - look for the small tiled 'Minton Hollins & Co. Patent Tile Works Stoke-on-Trent' nameplate here. \nSpot the Difference \r\n\r\nNext is an inner lobby which has tiled walls and tiled arches on three sides. The middle arch is the original Victorian one, but those to the left and right were created in the 1980 restoration. Compare the tiles and decorative tiled panels of a lady and you will spot the difference! Note the double doors with 'Smoke Room' deeply etched and frosted panels and through them the large porch with a plaster ceiling and wonderful colourful tiled walls in yellows, reds, greens and brown etc. There is a door that is no longer used with a number '3' on a small button, which was a requirement by the licensing magistrates in the past for all rooms in a pub. \r\n\r\nLeft through an arch is the large former games room, which is now a two-part lounge. As you enter there is a splendid tiled, cast-iron and decoratively carved fireplace with a coal fire. The upholstered original fixed bench seating runs around most of the room and in the wood panel above you will notice a number of bell-pushes, no longer working, which were used to get table service in the past. \r\n\r\nThe most striking feature is the wonderful large oval-shaped stained and leaded glass window screen at the far end - entitled 'Mine Host'. This was moved in the 1980s restoration from the arch to the right and is now in a false partition wall - if you inspect the tiling on the false wall and compare it to the tiles in the rest of the room you will notice the difference in colour and texture! \r\n\r\nVisit the unaltered gents', if you can, to see the original tiled walls and the six large original urinals. In the rear part of the lounge are more tiled walls, upholstered original fixed bench seating with mirrored panels above, again with bell-pushes and another splendid fireplace with a coal fire. \nMore Tiles!\r\n\r\nAn arch leads to the Staircase Hall which has a lovely tiled floor but due to some damage it is currently covered over by carpet. This small area has colourful tiled walls with a tile-painting of a pink coated hunting scene in rich colours. A curving staircase with richly painted wrought-iron balustrade picked out in gold has two massive decorative iron light standards at the foot of the stairs. \r\n\r\nThe multi-coloured tiled walls continue all the way up the staircase and around the first-floor landing. At quiet times ask for permission to walk upstairs and inspect the wonderful huge stained and leaded window which includes the words 'Erected 1901' and the logo of Mitchells & Butlers, also more of the tiled walls. There are two former public rooms upstairs - the club room (now called the Board Room) and the billiard room. The legendary Joe Davis, who was many times world champion for both snooker and billiards, played here in exhibition matches throughout the 1930s and '40s. \r\n\r\nMany pubs have upstairs public rooms  (another is the Stags Head, South Shields, Tyne & Wear),\r\n but with very few exceptions these have been brought into service after the building of the pub and /or do not have historic serveries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the staircase you walk into the splendid lobby with its recessed bar, a counter with multi-coloured tiled front, one of less than 20 in the UK, and a multi-coloured tiled arch over the whole area. There are five sections of bar with snob screens and just enough space underneath to serve drinks. These were devised to give privacy to drinkers in the smoke room. Two snob screens that needed replacement now have frosted glazed Oakham Ales logos in them. There are extensive cellars which have a narrow trough throughout to drain away rainwater from the street.\r\n\r\nOther heritage pubs with snob screens are Prince Alfred, London W9;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Travellers Friend, Woodford Green, Greater London;  Gate, London N22;  Bunch of Grapes, London SW3;  Crown, London N1; and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but these have been moved.",

        "Pub Name": "Rose Villa Tavern",
        "Address": "172 Warstone Lane, Birmingham, Hockley, B18 6JW",
        "Description": "Prominently sited in the heart of Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, the pub was built in 1919-20 for Mitchells & Butlers by their regular architects, Wood & Kendrick. It is an interesting building which is a kind of half-way house between the florid late Victorian and Edwardian pub on one hand, and the much simpler architecture of the inter-war period. The red brick exterior is a stripped version of the richly ornamented turn-of-the-twentieth-century Birmingham public house, but inside there is an extensive display of splendid tilework by Carters of Poole with dark green and buff predominating including 7 tiled paintings of classical maidens \u2013 possibly the finest display of Carters tilework in a pub? Other magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Caf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; General Havelock, Hastings, East Sussex; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; St James Tavern, Soho, London W1Dolphin, Hackney, London E8; andGolden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive part is the rear snug accessed from the right hand passageway via an impressive ceramic archway of buff tiles and faience or from the rear left hand room through a lobby with tiled walls of mainly light green and some buff ones and via a similar but smaller archway. This small room has floor to ceiling tiled walls topped by a frieze of urns and flowers and a superb ceramic inglenook fireplace featuring tiles and faience including a deep relief arch incorporating a ceramic head. Over the fireplace is a narrow tiled Arcadian scene featuring three ladies and more mainly light green and some buff tiles around it. The room is lit by a skylight with colourful leaded panel, the ladies toilet door has more leaded panels, but the bar counter here is modern. \r\n\r\nFrom the right hand door on the Warstone Lane side double inner doors lead into an impressive passage with terrazzo floor, walls covered in Carters tiles to picture frame height of mainly green topped by a frieze of urns and flowers. Just before the staircase high up is an impressive ceramic archway of buff tiles and faience. A dado of tiled walls flank the staircase with a frieze above. The decoration varies in different areas with rich swags in the corridor and staircase area. On the first floor is a function room with an old wood surround fireplace and more leaded windows, but new bar fittings added. \r\n\r\nOn the front left of the passageway is a vestibule entrance with stained and leaded panels leading to the main bar. This has a terrazzo floor, original panelled bar counter which curves on the right hand side and the original island style bar back fitting with rich Classical detailing featuring four columns and capitals but some modern work. Note that above the back fitting the ceramic work on the ceiling includes four scroll shaped brackets. The whole room is covered in Carters tiles to picture frame / three-quarter height in mainly buff and shades of green all topped off with a green faience ledge having leaf symbols regularly spaced along it. On the Vyse Street end of the main bar are three painted panels depicting girls in rustic settings with multi-coloured tiled surrounds, there is another one near the vestibule entrance partially covered by a red telephone box and throughout the room are decorative narrow colourful tiled panels. The other great feature is the three notable exterior round-arched windows including designs depicting at the centre a purple galleon with brown and streaky pink sales riding a sea-green wave, flowing foliage and two bands of semi-circular strips of green and yellow, and blue and white chequers leaded panels. \r\n\r\nOn the Warstone Lane side is the former off-sales passage which is no longer in use and gaps have been made in the walls so that it is now possible to walk around the pub. This area also has tiled walls and two more tiled paintings but they are difficult to view as this area is used for storage. The Lounge at the rear right has a vestibule entrance with tiled walls; original fixed seating in the bay window, parquet floor, but the bar counter here is a modern addition.",

Its listed description states \"The grandest of the post First World War \"reformed pubs\" built on a vast scale in a picturesque highly successful Vernacular Revival combining Midlands half-timbering and Cotswold stone, giving the impression, in its loose planning, of a gradual evolution from late medieval to Jacobean. The quality of detailing and materials embodies the best of the Birmingham Arts and Crafts tradition.\" \r\n\r\nAfter a refurbishment the pub re-opened as a Wetherspoon's on 23 July 2010. It has a wonderful timbered exterior with gables, carved woodwork, leaded glass, an original carved projecting sign, fine stonework and chimneys. The lower south end includes the manager's house, half timbered on a Cotswold stone base. At the rear is a bowling green with original stone-built pavilion and pergolas. \r\n\r\nOver the years there has been a lot of change on the ground floor but the baronial hall-style bar (originally called the gents' smoke room) with notable timber ceiling at the rear is impressive. Although opened up, the original small rooms at the front still have original features such as the fireplace and panelling in the mixed smoke room on the right and notable Tudor-style stone fireplace on the left with a carving of a black horse above. The hall on the left has more panelling and decorative ceiling and to the rear is another large room. \r\n\r\nHead upstairs for more fine architecture in the hallway at the top of the stairs and two more rooms. The Assembly Room is another baronial hall-style high ceilinged room with carved beams. Ask staff if you want to see the small committee room with its fine decorative plasterwork ceiling.",

It is an elegant three-and-a-half storey building with brown glazed brick to the ground floor and red brick and buff terracotta above. The style is free Classical. Inside tiles cover the passage, the public bar and staircase walls and are by Maw & Co. of Jackfield, Shropshire. The bar-back is original and has etched glass mirrors. \n\nBetween the public bar and the corridor is an unusual screen, its special feature being the extensive amount of glazing. The 'Smoking Room' is announced in etched glass in the door to this room at the rear and Britannia appears too for good measure. This room has the usual fixed seats and bell-pushes. If you go upstairs to the function room, note the seat with arm-rests - this was for the chairman at meetings of the Royal Ancient Order of Buffaloes. The pub began as the Aston Hall Tavern in 1867, changed to its present name in 1872. Henry Mitchell bought a 99-year lease in 1896, covenanting to rebuild within ten years.

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nSubstantial detached brick and terracotta three-storey pub built 1900 designed by William Jenkins for Mitchells & Butlers and surmounted by a tall clock tower with an ornate weather vane. The highlight is the impressive display of tiling on the dado believed to be by Maw & Co. of Jackfield, but, due to the boldness of the mouldings, they could be by the Medmenham Pottery, a rather arty/crafty firm in production during 1895-1905 and which architects liked particularly (or even Minton Holins of Stoke-on-Trent, whose tiles adorned a number of James & Lister Lea pubs for Mitchells & Butlers). The tiled dado is on both sides of the walls of the corridor throughout the pub, up one side of the staircase, on the first floor landing and also on the corridor-side wall in the public bar. The high ceilinged public bar retains its original carved mahogany bar back with mirrored panels and two rows of Victorian tiles; the original bar counter with match strikers, but it has a new top, also a good cornice; but the fixed seating is modern and possibly a partition in the bar have been lost. \n\n The off-sales situated to the right of the counter and accessed from Anderton Road is no longer in use but is believed to retain its original fittings. The games room (former Smoke Room) has retained its fixed seating but has lost its original fireplace. The rear room has an original fireplace, two pieces of original fixed seating with carved wood detailing also a good cornice, and service is via a hatch to the back of the servery. A wood strip on the wall behind the servery indicates one section of fixed seating has been removed. In the corridor changes have been made to the hatch and a small piece of wall on the Smoke Room side removed and replaced by a glazed panel to improve supervision by bar staff (possibly at the insistence of licensing magistrates or police?). \n\nOn the first floor there are two rooms There are some original \u2018Club Room\u2019, \u2018Dining Room\u2019 first-floor windows and others which have 'Mitchells & Butlers Limited' in a roundel around a central 'Crown' illustration, 'Estd 1781' and 'Trade Mark'. Sadly, three original good quality Mitchells & Butlers etched windows in the public bar were smashed and replaced by plain/frosted glass in c2006. Due to heavy storms in the latter part of 2008 the building, particularly on the first and second floors, and also the clock tower, has suffered significant water damage and they are currently unusable. It is believed plans are being drawn up to carry out repairs and possibly a conversion of upper floors to flats. The car park is owned by the local mosque, who do still allow customers of the pub to use it. Statutorily listed in 2009 following a successful application by CAMRA. \n\nTHE INTERIOR FITTINGS OF THIS STATUTORILY LISTED PUB HAVE BEEN REMOVED WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BIRMINGHAM CITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN INFORMED - the pub has been deleted from the National Inventory.",

He had been responsible before the First World War for alterations to the previous pub on the site, which suffered a fire. The replacement is relatively plain outside and now stands alone; the terraced housing around it having been demolished. The interior retains much of the original work in three rooms; the off sales is now a kitchen. The public bar occupies the angle of the site and retains its counter and bar-back with round arches and mirror glass, good vestibule entrance; also good ceiling decoration. The lobby area between the bar and club room has very typical 1920s tiling. Behind the servery lies a small smoke room complete with fixed seating, bell-pushes, fireplace and ceiling decoration; the counter, however, is modern. The third 'Club Room' is accessed via a passage with inter-war tiled dado and retains some original seating. The original outside toilets remain, now accessed via a covered walkway. Unusually, there are letters on the door, rather than numbers which are a requirement of the licensing magistrates. Beware the sign outside saying 'Built 1897' - simply not true!",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\n\nFormer Description\n\nThe pub was started just before the First World War in 1913 and finished during its early stages (1915). Architect Arthur Edwards for Holders Brewery Ltd. In the smoke room the flags of the allies were patriotically installed. The building illustrates the shift in emphasis from lavish decoration and architectural exuberance to the greater restraint, simplicity and decency in the design of early C20 public houses. The architect was Arthur Edwards, working for the Holt Brewery Co. The main facade is symmetrical and has a Tudor flavour with three-sided terracotta bay windows. A little black brick diapering relieves the red brick flanking walls. The return down Blakeland Street is very long and has lots of varied detail. The public bar occupies the angle of the streets in the common Birmingham way and has the unusual survival of a low timber and glass screen which splits it into two unequal parts. Original fire surrounds in the (large) smoke room at the back.",

The pub changed its name in 1957 to the Romping Cat, allegedly for local traditional purposes. The entrance door on Elmore Green Road leads into a passage with a colourful Victorian tiled floor and an inner door with \"Smoke Room & Outdoor Dept\" etched and frosted window which leads to the off-sales hatch with its original sliding sash windows. \r\n\r\nA door on the right of the passage has a \u2018Bar\u2019 decorative etched panel. The bare boarded public bar on the right retains its original curved and panelled bar counter with dividing pilasters that are fluted and curved like brackets. The original bar back fitting with slender fluted pilasters has seen some modern embellishments such as wood to affix the optics. The original fixed seating has a baffle near the right hand side door, there is an old wood surround fireplace with a modern \u2018Banks\u2019s\u2019 interior. There are two curved exterior \"Banks's Noted Ales & Stouts\" etched windows one of which is a replacement. The left hand door has a \u2018bar\u2019 decorative etched panel. \r\n\r\nOn the left of the off sales passage is a door with a \"Smoke Room\" etched panel and door protectors which leads to a small room with a hatch, original curved bench seating with carved bench ends of a floral design and bell pushes in the panelling above. This room has another modern fireplace in the old wood surround and there is another etched exterior window. All  rooms have coloured glass in the top of all the round arched exterior windows. \r\n\r\nA colourful Victorian tiled passage around the back of the servery has a door for staff access to the servery with a hatch and a shelf for service to the Coffee Room. This small room has a door with the figure \"4\" on it, a \"Coffee Room\" etched window, and a tiled and wood surround fireplace. New inside toilets were added in 1997 where the former scullery at the rear of the Coffee Room was situated and this involved the removal of part of the joining wall and a small piece of bench seating to the left of the fireplace. The outside Gents and Ladies are still across the yard at the rear but no longer in use. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the last remaining pubs to sell the Banks\u2019s Original (Mild) and Bitter from keg-like dispensers labelled as \u2018Cask Ale\u2019 which dispense half pint into oversized glasses \u2013 there is also a guest beer on handpump.",

The ancient board above the entrance that states the pub is licensed for 'Public Singing & Music' and the licensee is a 'Dealer in Tobacco' is an indication of what lies inside. This is a remarkable survivor of a style of pub which existed in their thousands in the mid 19th century and have now virtually disappeared. It retains its unchanged layout of a quarry-tiled and half-panelled passage with off sales hatch, public bar on the right and two small rooms on the left. The Victorian bar-back has a number of drawers in it and the mahogany bar counter has a Formica top added in the 1960s when health experts were insisting this was more hygienic. The 1927 handpumps survive. Seating consists of old bare fixed benches and a couple of basic low benches. \r\nThe small front left room has bay windows with 'Smoke Room', 'Wines' and 'Spirits' lower panes, a tiled and wood surround fireplace and unusual fixed seating consisting of leather padded benches broken up into individual seats on each side by padded arm rests. The small rear-left room has leather covered bench seating with baffles and another tiled and wood surround fireplace. The outside Gents' are well worth a visit and have a screened entrance, two rows of massive 100 year old urinals and two WCs with white glazed brick walls. Among the outbuildings are a malt room, part of the former brewery and three pig sties. The rarity of such unaltered modest public houses led to its being Grade II listed in January 1996.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2016. \u2028Closed 2013 and now apparently being used as a private residence so re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nOnce hundreds, if not thousands, of Black Country pubs must have looked like this simple three-room corner establishment. They are now exceptionally rare, hence the grade II listing in 1999. It was built c.1870 and is of rendered and painted brick with leaded lights on front windows. Most of the interior is as it was at the turn of last century with only the front right hand room having been refurbished in post-war times. A corridor with red and black quarry tiles leads to the rear (and outside toilets). Was owned by the Wolverhampton and Dudley Brewery from 1912 to c.2005. \n\nOn the left, behind a match-boarded partition, is a tiny tap room that has a latch door with the figure \u20181\u2019 (a requirement of licensing magistrates). It has a \u2018Tap Room\u2019 etched front window, tiled floor and what looks like an inglenook fireplace runs down the left hand / exterior wall and runs over the servery and there is a small cast iron fireplace with log fire. Basic old fixed benches run around the room with a baffle/draught screen by the door and there is just one large scrubbed table. There is a panelled bar counter with simple pilastered bar front and shallow brackets with a Formica top from c.1960. The bar-back is of old basic shelving with some c.1960 embellishments. \n\nContinuing down the corridor there is a hatch with two-part window on the servery side set into a vertically boarded and framed partition. Behind the tap room is a long room with an irregular plan reflecting the shape of the site, that would have been two small rooms originally and like this since c.1900. It has a door with the figure \u20183\u2019 on it, old basic benches running down both sides with a modest baffle near the door and service is from a doorway with a flap to the back of the servery. There is an early 20th century tiled and wood surround fireplace with a 1960s gas fire in front and old wall cupboards on either side. \n\nOn the right a third plain room with a Smoke Room window and the figure \u20182\u2019 on the door. This small room received a refit in the late 1950s and retains c.1900 fixed seating that was re-leatheretted in c.1960 with baffles at each end by the door; it also has a classic 1950s tiled fireplace with a gas fire in front of it. \n\nAt the end of the corridor note the letter \u2018C\u2019 on the cellar door. The pub still retains its outside ladies\u2019 (now covered over) and gents\u2019 which is still open to the elements \u2013 very rare these days. \n\nThe Shakespeare was sold by its pub company owners in September 2013 and is currently closed. It is currently felt highly unlikely that it will reopen as a pub and having brought its plight to the attention of Dudley Council's Senior Conservation Officer - this is a Grade II listed building - steps are now being taken to do all that is possible to preserve the pubs rare interior.",

        "Description": "An institution - if asking for directions locally always say \"Ma Pardoe's\". A legendary pub in the annals of real ale - when CAMRA was formed in 1971 it was one of only four pubs to have kept its home-brewing tradition since built. This tradition has been broken in the meantime but has recommenced. Licensed since 1835, the current pub and brewery were built in 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe front bar is unaltered since Victorian times - apart from the fact that the attractive, bright red paint is unlikely to be authentic. It is one of the most distinctive public bars in the whole of the UK. The most remarkable feature is the enamel ceiling (possibly unique) bearing a picture of the eponymous swan; an old stove still in use with its flue running across the room; and a weighing machine. It retains the original six-bay Victorian bar back featuring an etched mirror 'The Old Swan', an original bar counter with a new top, and old fixed seating. Leaving the public bar by the right-hand door and the other side of a partition wall is the tiny off-sales lobby with a two-part glazed hatch and basic seating attached to the partition. Making up the original pub is the rear smoke room with a etched glass panel in the door, Victorian tiled and marble (?) fireplace with elaborate mirror panel above; service via a hatch to the back of the bar, a good ceiling rose and original fixed seating with baffles at either end. Also a dumb waiter between the off-sales and the smoke room with an old cast base fireplace nearby and a hatch to the back of the bar. In the 1980s, the adjoining shop was acquired and absorbed into the pub as a new lounge, but this has no impact on the historic core - a model of how to make a traditional pub viable without ruining it. A rear passageway with new toilets off links it to the original pub on the right.",

        "Description": "A corner pub built by Holt's Brewery of Aston in 1890 in the red and terracotta style so typical of Birmingham with a polygonal turret on the corner. There is evidence of the original ownership in painted and terracotta features on the exterior, and in the remaining etched glass of the exterior windows and door panels, including Holt's 'squirrel' - a feature which was later adopted by Ansells. The side entrance leads into a splendid drinking passage separating the front public bar and a separate rear room. The L-shaped passage has colourful Victorian tiled floor and floor to ceiling tiled walls which feature tiled panels in brown, yellow, gold and blue-green with a band at dado level of brown, green and gold tiles and yellow ones above to the cornice, which has another band of brown and yellow tiles. The existence of shelves indicates the old tradition of passageway drinking still exists here. There is a small counter, almost a hatch for serving this area and the smoke room. Note the etched glass panel in the inner door which has the wording 'Smoke Room & Club Room'. The floor tiling continues all the way around to the toilets at the rear and there is a panelled dado. Upstairs is a function room with modern bar fittings and brick fireplace, but 7 of the original 9 etched windows survive. \r\n\r\nThe front bare boarded public bar has floor to ceiling tiling with colourful tiles on the dado and yellow ones above with a band of brown tiles at cornice level. The original bar counter and fine mirrored bar-back featuring slender columns with capitals remain with few modern additions. The rare copper ceiling has been painted over and the original benches remain. The room would originally have been divided by partition walls - note the doors on the corner (the vestibule looks like a modern addition) and on Church Street. A doorway from the passage leads to the smoke room which is a small bare boarded room with re-upholstered Victorian fixed seating all around, a baffle by the door and another halfway along the seating on the window side and above the seating is a panel with a large number of bell pushes. The tiled and wood surround fireplace looks to date from the 1930s. There is another Holt's window, but another has been lost in recent years and not replaced.",

        "Description": "This three-roomed pub is constructed of mainly 18th century red brick and modern rough cast and is one of few \u2018no-bar\u2019 pubs in the country. Originally a farmhouse, the Anson family opened their front room as a beerhouse towards the end of the 19th century. Boatman on the Rushall Canal, which runs at the rear of the pub, being good customers. It gained a full license in about 1895. It has a nickname of \u2018The Widows\u2019 because it was run by two old ladies in the past. From the front door a quarry tiled floored passage runs to the rear and has one table near a hatch on the left hand side. Alongside the hatch for service to two rooms on the right there is a half door in an old partition wall and when you walk through the door you are standing in the servery alongside the staff! This is one of only a handful of pubs where this is still possible \u2013 in years past there would have been many. \r\n\r\nYou will notice there is no bar counter as such and the handpumps are all affixed to the bar back fitting. This is one of only six traditional pubs left in the whole of the UK without a bar counter including the other Heritage Pubs the Cock, Broom, Bedfordshire; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Tuckers Grave, Faulkland, Somerset; Rose & Crown, Huish Episcopi, Somerset; and Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nUntil a cellar was built backing onto the canal in the 1950s, casks of beer were on stillage in the area where the bar back fitting is now situated \u2013 this makes the bar back fitting no older than 50-60 years. They never added a bar counter making it only one of only a dozen \u2018no bar\u2019 pubs in the UK. There is what looks look a tiny piece of counter on the far left near the kitchen but most drinks are handed to customers rather than be left here. The red screeded small public bar that you are now in has an old dado panelling, a 1930s brick fireplace and a boarded ceiling. \r\n\r\nThe front right Smoke Room has an old red tiled floor and modern brick fireplace under an old inglenook with the remains of a bread oven within a cupboard. All around the room is fixed bench seating which looks like it dates from the 1930s. The pub was hit by a thunderbolt on V E Day 1945 \u2013 it hit a chimney in the smoke room which was full of regulars planning the evening's celebrations and they all ended up covered in soot. The legendary band leader Glenn Miller is said to have drunk in the pub during the war with other G I\u2019s. At the rear is the lounge, a small room that has been brought later into use and has no old fittings.",

        "Description": "An incredibly rare survivor \u2013 an unspoilt gem of a four-room pub with a Victorian tower brewery forming part of the premises and which produces award winning ales. Thought to have been built in the 1860s, it was bought by Sarah Hughes at auction in 1920 and the layout and fittings are from a refitting shortly afterwards. Little has changed since the 1920s apart from the creation of additional rooms at the rear, which do not impact on the historic core. From the front door a red tiled passageway runs to the rear where the brewery building is situated. Inner door has a leaded glazed panel. The pub has a remarkable arrangement in terms of its servery, a small glazed-in cubicle between the snug at the front and smoke room at the back with hatches for service in the two rooms and passage. No exactly comparable examples are known. The Snug on the front left is a small room with a door, a 1920s tiled, cast-iron with marble surround fireplace, fixed seating in three sections with a piano fitting neatly in between the front sections. The three side section of the servery in this room has a door with a small two-part sliding window hatch with the lower section permanently in the upright position and a small ledge to hold drinks. \r\n\r\nThe Tap Room on the front right has a door in a shallow vestibule, more red tiles on the floor, fixed seating in the form of bare benches attached to a tongue and groove dado which appears to date from Victorian times and could therefore be the original 1860s seating? However, there is a range fireplace which normally indicates a room that was formerly the kitchen and brought into use much later. There is a long oblong table which looks of age and a low basic loose bench. In the passageway the servery has a 1920s counter front and service is via a narrow hatch below a leaded glazed fixed panel which means customers have to crouch to order their drinks etc. Behind the fixed panel appears to be a sliding one that is fixed in the upright position. Note the Victorian service bell high up above the hatch. At the rear left is the large Smoke Room with tongue and groove full height panelling and fixed bench seating all around the room with two baffles, all of which have a Victorian appearance. There are two cast iron fireplaces which may date from the 1920s and presumably this was two small rooms prior to the 1920s refit. The section of the servery in this room is almost identical to that in the snug and has a door in the middle with a small two-part window hatch with the lower section permanently in the upright position and a small ledge to hold drinks. \r\n\r\nA doorway at the rear of the smoke room leads to a modern conservatory-style extension which acts as a covered walkway to the toilets and brewhouse. The brewery is little changed and still retains a gas-fired 1921 copper vessel. Sarah Hughes brewed the beer now known as Dark Ruby Mild until her death in 1951. The brewery lied idle from the 1950s until 1987 when John Hughes, Sarah\u2019s grandson recommenced brewing. From the passage past the servery a former exterior door leads into a red-tiled former patio area now another room created to satisfy demand and it has a part glazed roof. The outside toilets remain at the rear.",

        "Description": "Update 2013: \r\n\r\nThe Waterloo was bought at auction in October 2012. The new owner indicated a wish, at the time, to use the ground and lower ground floors for a grill room, restaurant and cafe. However, no work was started on this listed building until the Council's Conservation Officer insisted on various urgent repairs to the fabric. The former pub area is largely intact, with just some minor damage to the amazing tiling. The upper floors are to be converted to flats. The Council expects to receive applications for listed building and planning consents shortly.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2016: \r\n\r\nThe flats are essentially complete and supposedly ready to be let.  The original sash window have repaired by a carpenter and have been retained.  (Although the owner is considering specialist \u2018heritage\u2019 double glazed units \u2013 this would need to be agreed and may require a further consent).  These works apply to the upper floors only however.  There is still no progress regarding the ground floor and basement although they remain dry and are being effectively preserved.   \r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt as a flagship pub-hotel in 1907 for Mitchells & Butlers whose brewery was nearby. Their architects, Wood & Kendrick, whom they often employed, provided a lavish Edwardian Baroque front for the corner site - M&B terracotta survives on the fascia and high gables. The astonishing features of the interior of this pub is the tilework. It covers the walls of the public bar - and even the ceiling. There are bands of green, blue, cream and salmon with highly decorative Victorian motifs and descending wreaths. The counter and bar back are excellent, original work. If you look at the floor pattern closely you can see how there was once a partition across the middle of the bar. You can also work out how there was a screened-off outdoor area on the left. Behind the bar, a central lobby with service via a hatch-counter has a staircase and fully-tiled walls and ceilings in same style as the bar; off this is a modernised lounge. \r\n\r\nBut the really spectacular room is the Grill Room in the basement: this was (and still is) a restaurant and features walls and ceilings extravagantly tiled with a frieze of galleons. On one side is the original servery and on the other a cast-iron grill - this superb Edwardian survivor is still fired up and used to cook the grills. The pub also doubled as a commercial hotel and at the top of the stairs you will find a small cubicle that was used by a night-watchman.",

        "Description": "An excellent, largely intact example of Birmingham's large inter-war pubs, in this case built in 1923-4 to designs by James & Lister Lea (probably Mr Brassington) for Mitchells & Butlers. Behind the slightly asymmetrical frontage are no less than five rooms and a very much used bowling green. New management in 2004 has led to the uncovering of the public bar and assembly room floors, restoration of the original fireplaces, and the opening of a link on the left of the public bar to the 'Gents' Only' lounge to bring the room into greater use - it was disused for many years. Unfortunately the wide openings cut in the dividing walls either side of the former off sales have been implemented rather crudely, and spoils that end of the bar.\r\n\r\nThe front main double doors lead into a lobby with an inter war tiled dado. In the centre is a large public bar with a terrazzo floor and an original light oak high bar counter. The relatively plain original light oak bar back fitting remains but it was painted yellow in 2004 to follow the current trend for modern bright colours rather than dull dark 'old' colours. The original fixed seating remains but painted white and there are baffles as you enter. There was an off sales where the present ladies toilet is on the left. \r\n\r\nAt the front on the left side is the former Gents' Only lounge with panelling, original fixed seating newly re-upholstered and two good baffles. This narrow room has a 1920s brick and good wood surround fireplace with arch shaped decoration above and a strip of panelling above the fixed seating which includes bell pushes from the days of table service. The gents here are intact with terrazzo floor, 1920s tiled wall, two urinals and sink. \r\n\r\nDouble doors at the rear lead to the Assembly Room on the left now used for dining and overlooking the rear garden. This large room has a parquet floor, fine nine sectioned ceiling, original wood surround fireplace with a modern interior, and a small hatch to the back of the servery with an old dumb waiter alongside. Note the bell pushes unusually placed in the dado panelling. At the rear there is a patio which has been covered over in recent years - on the left hand side of the garden is a six-bay curved loggia with seating, and beyond the garden is the bowling green. \r\n\r\nDouble doors lead to the rear Smoke Room with an attractive small screened three-sided servery, which has lost its lower rising panels. It retains an original counter, original fixed seating with modest baffles, wood panelling to two-thirds height with good plaster decoration above the panelling and on the ceiling, and a 1920s brick and wood surround fireplace. The gents off the rear smoke room is intact. The ladies has a carpet over the terrazzo floor and original wall tiles. \r\n\r\nThe front smoke room (now the 'Penn Lounge') on the right has a door with the figure '8' on it and original fixed seating re-upholstered with a strip of panelling above having bell pushes. This narrow room has an original brick and wood surround fireplace with a mirror in the mantelpiece above and a small counter to the side of the servery.",

        "Address": "109 Kent Street, Upper Gornal, DY3 1UX",
        "Description": "The interest here is one, very special room (left rear). The detailing suggests it may have been fitted up in the 1920s. What looks like wood panelling is in fact artificial - little more than wall paper with cross members and verticals being applied to it (and not uncommon in pubs where a cheap, quick-fix Tudor effect was required. There are fixed benches and some stained glass. But the real interest is the shelving, drawers and bank of four hand-pumps (with pewter drip tray) on the corridor wall - in other words a servery without a counter (still in use on Saturday nights). Such arrangements are very rare today (in the West Midlands, see also the Manor Arms, Rushall) but were probably not that uncommon in small, basic public houses. There is also a hatch with a pewter ledge to the corridor and which would have been used both for off-sales and customers in the second room which has now been taken up by the ladies' toilet. The rest of the pub was not in public use; the present servery area at the front was a butcher's shop (outside door on left: there would have been a solid wall between it and the pub corridor), and were installed by Bathams who took over in 1997. The building dates from 1780 and became a pub around 1832. The Perry family owned it for many years and brewed until 1959. Also known as 'Sallie's', after the landlady from 1942 to 1991. The former small brewery at the back is now inactive.",

        "Pub Name": "Vine",
        "Address": "35 Lichfield Road, Wednesfield, WV11 1TN",
        "Description": "An unspoilt and little-altered inter-war pub with three rooms and a hallway which is now a traditional real ale pub. Designs survive from January 1937 by the architects Watkin & Maddox of Burslem, working for brewers Truman, Hanbury & Buxton. This is a rare, intact example of a simple inter-war, urban working-class pub. It opened in 1938 and remains complete apart from the loss of the off-sales hatch opposite the front door and the insertion of a tiny counter in the right-hand lounge. The public bar is on the left. A third public room lies at the back across a hallway. The importance of such a building was recognised in 2002 by its being given grade II listed status. It was built as a replacement for, and to the rear of, the original pub which was a small beerhouse. \r\n\r\nBuilt in classic 1930s brick and set back from the road. The front door leads into a tiny lobby with colourful terrazzo tiled floor - originally there was an off sales hatch facing you but this was replaced by a piece of glass in the late 1990s. Original door on the left of the lobby leads into the public bar with colourful terrazzo tiled floor and the original bar counter with a bar top from 2010 which replaced a Formica one from the 1960s. The small room retains its original 1930s tiled fireplace, original fixed seating and a good blue 'Public Bar' leaded exterior window. Original door at rear leads to a hallway with colourful terrazzo tiled floor, the ladies on the left retains its terrazzo tiled floor and terrazzo dado. \r\n\r\nOriginal door on the right of the lobby leads to the Smoke Room with a white on blue leaded 'Smoke Room' exterior window. It has a parquet floor, an original Tudor arch stone fireplace, and original fixed seating with bell pushes in the panel above from the days of table service. There is one small change here - service was originally from a hatch to the back of the servery but in 2004 a small bar counter was added here but done with great care by Black Country Inns. Beyond the hallway is the rear Smoke Room with original door, a baffle as you enter, original fixed seating all around the room and another Tudor shaped stone arch fireplace. The gents' retains original urinals, terrazzo tiled floor and terrazzo dado. There are more little altered rooms and toilets upstairs.",

        "Pub Name": "Haunch of Venison",
        "Address": "1 Minster Street, Salisbury, SP1 1TB",
        "Description": "A city centre pub of great antiquity which has, remarkably, kept its historic appearance largely unchanged over the past 100 years with several separate small bars. Established in 1320, the present three-story building is mainly 15th century with alterations in the 18th century. It is believed to have been built as the Church House for St Thomas's situated just behind. \r\n\r\nThe entrance leads to a tiny lobby and a narrow door leads into a tiny snug called 'The Horsebox' at the front on the right hand side. It is also referred to as a 'Ladies Snug' dating back to the times where public houses were for the preserve of men only. It has a black and white tiled floor, half-height panelled walls with three pieces of bare benches attached, just one barrel tables but no stools. The panelled bar counter has a pewter top and there are 100 year old bar back shelves on a mirrored back. Note the rare wooden carved elevated arch with seven spirit taps with a brass plate inscription 'Gravity fed spirit taps fitted by H Neale, Plumber, Salisbury' with gilt decoration and dated 1909'. CAMRA is only aware of four other sets of spirit cocks at Shipman's, Northampton; Queens Head 'Turners Vault', Stockport, Greater Manchester; Haunch of Venison, Salisbury, Wiltshire; Bull, Paisley, Scotland; and Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland - all CAMRA Heritage Pubs.\r\n\r\nThrough a pair of doors with etched 'The Haunch of Venison' panels is the Public Bar called The House of Commons with another black and white quarry tiled floor. The small room has some splendid old fielded panelling, bench seating running down three sides of the room, and old fireplace with carvings above. The only way to get casks of beer into the cellar is from the public bar and while firkins (9 gallon casks) can go through the door on the left of the servery, larger ones involve removing the shelf behind the counter and opening up the bar front - very rare. The panelled bar counter also has an old pewter top and is one of only half a dozen such examples left in the country that CAMRA is aware of. Note how there are no dispensers on the counter and handpumps are affixed to the bar back-fitting which also has drawers, again some thing that is rare. On the bar back is another set of eight spirit taps (one is missing). \r\n\r\nGo up the stairs towards the restaurant and halfway up on the left hand side you will find another small room called 'The House of Lords'. It has a low oak beamed ceiling (due to the cellar below), oak panelled walls and can comfortably seat a dozen people. Under the inglenook fireplace note the former bread oven now with a secure iron gate across it beyond which is a smoke preserved mummified hand. It is believed to be from an 18th century demented whist player who lost it in a card game due to cheating! \r\n\r\nContinue up the stairs into the restaurant upstairs, now called 'One', which includes part of a Merchants house added to the inn in the 16th century and at quiet times is worth a look for its wealth of exposed beams in its two rooms. The left hand room has an uneven bare wood floor, old dado panelling with some carved sections in parts and a fine old carved wood surround fireplace. Up a couple of steps is another splendid creaking wood floor room with an ornate ceiling containing many bosses. It has half timbered walls with fitted seating attached to old dado panelling and a large stone fireplace that dates back to 1558 with a brick interior (possibly added in the 1930s?). \r\n\r\nThere is a hidden bar but this is not accessible to the public as its only access is by going down the staircase in the private area next to the right hand upstairs room. The tiny cloisters bar was originally accessed from the street - look for the 'Haunch of Venison' glass fronted sign on the other side of the jeweller's shop, which is located under the restaurant, indicating its entrance. It has a fine carved bar front and sectioned beamed ceiling but is now only used for storage.",

        "Pub Name": "Fleece Inn",
        "Address": "The Cross, Bretforton, WR11 7JE",
        "Description": "A delightful building mostly dating from the C17 and it was the first pub to be bequeathed to the National Trust (they currently own nearly 40) It was built as a longhouse by a farmer named Bryd and remained in the ownership of a single family until 1977. The last private owner was Miss Lola Taplin who lived here all of her 77 years and locals will tell you that she would not serve while Coronation Street was on TV or if you were a group! The inn sign is the coat of arms of the Ashwin Family, who, lived in the Manor House in Bretforten.  The locals know the Fleece as 'The Ark' because the local growers would come in two by two after a hard days work on the land! \r\n\r\nThe separate rooms have been kept along with their historic furnishings. Disaster struck the Fleece on 28 Feb. 2004 when it was severely damaged by a fire. It was very carefully restored and reopened for business in May 2005. Whilst closed a bar selling real ale was opened in the adjoining 16th century thatched barn, which is now available for functions. The layout of three rooms - Pewter Room, Brewhouse and Dug Out - remain. There is a tiny area in front of the bar counter which leads to the original front door and has a couple of bar stools and you may find some locals drinking here. It has old dado panelling on the wall and now there are three openings to the servery - the door and first hatch were there in Lola's day and the National Trust created another hatch in the solid wall. There were no handpumps in Lola's days - casks of beer were set up on the bar back area so the shelving here is all modern. \r\n\r\nThe nearest room to the servery is The Brewhouse, which has a uneven flagstone floor. Look for the two indentations in the wall which were how the water from the well outside were fed into the room. Two steps down leads to the Dug Out, the former Games Room and was popular for darts when the pub team was top of their league in Lola's day. Although the dart board is still there not a dart is thrown these days as you are likely to be throwing over the heads of people dining! The room still retains its hatch which has a new top. and has a stone fireplace reputedly taken from Evesham Abbey. \r\n\r\nThe Pewter Room is named after the impressive pewter collection that has been on display for over 300 years. Note the witches circles in front of the original inglenook fireplace which have been repainted by the National Trust, which, according to tradition, are there to prevent witches from entering down the chimney. There is an impressive settle around the fireplace which creates a passage into the room. Take a look at the rear of it and you will notice two tiny doors at the bottom. You can open the doors but in a similar way to items in National Trust properties 'please do not touch the shoes'! This room is the venue for the folk nights every Thursday. The original toilets are now store rooms and new gents' and disabled toilets have opened were the domestic kitchen was situated. The catering kitchen and ladies' above were where the original cellar was as a new cellar has been created in a building adjoining the barn. The pubs hosts an Apple & Ale Festival early October.",

        "Pub Name": "Bell & Cross",
        "Address": "Holy Cross Green, Clent, DY9 9QL",
        "Description": "A prominent painted brick building in the centre of the village and known to have been a pub for nearly 200 years. It retains its original three rooms and two more brought into use and, although there is a heavy emphasis on food nowadays, a good sense of a traditional, small village pub can still be recaptured. The central entrance leads to a red and black quarry-tiled corridor that runs to the rear - note the figure '2' on the inner door and the tiny hatch in the wall on the left, which was the off sales. Off to the left is the small public bar with a figure '3' on the door. These numbers were a requirement of the licensing magistrates. \r\n\r\nThe splendid little altered public bar is kept exclusively for drinkers. It has an angled bar back which was originally just the corner piece with decorative architrave and was probably a display for bottles prior to the addition of a bar counter. Then in the period 1890 to 1910 a bar counter and the three-bay bar back fitting were added. If you take a look at where the bar counter meets the bar back and you will see remains of an old bar counter. Then in the inter-war period the bar counter was replaced \u2013 you can see how the console brackets on the front of the present counter are much larger than the two on the old counter and the contour on the top of the bar counter is larger and cruder. Bar back shelving is held up by delicate pillars. There is a section of panelled dado by the door, old fixed seating in two sections with a baffle by the door. The brick fireplace looks to date from the 1950s. \r\n\r\nOn the right the corridor has a timber and glass full-height screen which curves off to the right and which forms the wall for a wonderful old room on the right, which is complete apart from losing its door. This small space looks just as many thousands must have done up and down the land. Note the meat hooks in the ceiling. The fireplace again looks to be post-war brick under a former inglenook. The original bench seating runs all around the room right up to the fireplace, which now has a modern fire in front of it. \r\n\r\nThis snug could be called one of the UK\u2019s best pub rooms as there are only a handful of similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. However, the modern furniture and the room being ready for diners detracts from its traditional quality. There are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, Yorkshire, West;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; andAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nThe room beyond the partitioned one was the licensees private living room until c.1960. Opposite and behind the public bar is was what formerly the Gentlemen's Smoke Room. At the rear is a larger room created out of a former barn and which has the figures '17' on the door! These three rooms to the rear of the pub have been refitted  in modern times and it is good to see the minor refurbishment carried out Nov 07 retained the original layout and fittings. Recent modifications have seen the doors removed from the rear two rooms, and the bell push removed from the Gentlemen's Smoke Room.",

        "Pub Name": "Monkey House",
        "Address": "Defford, WR8 9BW",
        "Description": "Unique - that's the Cider House, one of the country's most unspoilt pubs and part of a C17 thatched, half-timbered listed building. It has been in landlady Gill Collins family for 150 years. The main bar is actually outside - its the front garden! There is seating outside including tables and chairs on the path leading to the hatch; under the eaves of the cottage; and all over the sizeable garden. And if the weather isn't too good you can enjoy a drink in the former bakehouse at the side which has a latch door, screeded floor, pew and other seats, a wood burning stove in a brick fireplace with the bread oven alongside. \r\n\r\nThe drink is cider for this is one of only four remaining cider-only houses in the country (no beer is served). Service is not over one of those new-fangled bar counters but through a hatch in a stable door on the left of the cottage. The casks of cider are stillaged behind in a ground-floor 'cellar'. many locals drink out of their own pottery mugs. It has possibly the most unspoilt outside gents' toilets in the country - four concrete block walls and no roof so tall gents can see into the fields and have a 360 degrees view of the surrounding countryside. The outside ladies' does have a roof! This wonderful establishment also goes by the nickname 'The Monkey'. Many years ago a well-mellowed customer returned home covered in cuts and scratches which he attributed to being set upon by a tribe of monkeys (rather than a self-induced collapse into a bramble patch). \r\n\r\nThe regular cider is a 6% dry blend made especially for the Cider House by Westons of Much Marcle at a remarkably good price of \u00a32.40 (2011), also Medium at 5% and a 4.1% Perry (from a polypin). There is no beer or lager, they have wine, but the perry is better value, and soft drinks. \"This is a true Cider House\" says landlady Gill Collins.",

        "Pub Name": "Three Kings",
        "Address": "Church End, Hanley Castle, Hanley Castle, WR8 0BL",
        "Description": "A pub of two halves which has been in the same family since 1911. The building dates back to the 16th century on the left and consists of a cruck-framed hall, now encased in brick. The front door is approached via a brick path and inside a quarry-tiled passage runs to the rear. On the right through a sliding door is a superb small bar with quarry-tiled floor, a huge stone fireplace taking up most of the one side of the room with a copper firehood added in the mid-1960s. A high-backed settle actually forms the partition wall between the bar and the passage, and there is wall bench and window seating. There is a serving hatch with a 1950s ribbed hardboard front, the handpumps being situated within the servery which has miscellaneous old shelving. In the past, some regular customers were allowed to sit in the servery. To the left of the passage is a little-used bare boarded smoke room with a sliding door. It has a brick fireplace possibly from the 1950s and wall bench seating attached to old dado panelling. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the passage is a small red brick floor area with an old 'Allen Brothers, Malvern' mirror and continuing to the right you enter Nell's lounge. This is situated in a separate and older timber framed building which was added to the pub in 1982 having been schoolmistress Nell Creese's house until 1979. The rear section was her kitchen and still contains a range fireplace. The front section was Nell's living room and contains a fine stone inglenook fireplace with bread oven and log fire, also a high-backed settle. The bar fittings were added in 1982 when part of the wall between the two bars was removed to link them. Note the ancient Gaskell & Chambers handpump in this area which was still in use until 2011, when it was retired until replacement parts can be found. \r\n\r\nThe inn-sign depicts the three biblical kings in all their finery but the idea of the name probably originates from a former family of pub-keepers. In 1710 a Richard Kings (sic) sold a property called the Three Kings (but at a different location) for \u00a34 15s (about \u00a3520 today). The present building, with fabric going back to the 16th century and probably with earlier remains, is known to have been a pub in 1841.",

        "Description": "Built 1901 by architect Frederick Hughes for R Allen & Son Brewers, and similar in style to many Birmingham Victorian pubs. A wedge shaped two-storey building of red brick and stone with Art Nouveau detailing, three oriel windows on the first floor and a stone frieze. The front door on The Butts leads into a vestibule entrance and through double doors with etched glass panels and two leaded panels above is an impressive entrance hall with a terrazzo floor and floor-to-ceiling decorative tiles in brown, green, turquoise and cream with tiled panels down the left hand side wall and on the external wall side of the short passage to the right leading to the public bar. The right hand side is a mahogany partition wall that forms the bar-back fitting and has a row of leaded panels all along the top. There are two marble steps half way along the passage and a door marked \u2018Private\u2019 has a leaded panel above. Through an inner door on the right there is the old off-sales with two-part sliding hatch with leaded windows in the partition wall to the servery.\n\r\nThrough the door with a \u2018Bar\u2019 etched panel and a decorative fanlight is a virtually intact room with terrazzo floor (now covered by a carpet), original curved mahogany bar counter with panelled front and consoles, an elaborate five-bay mirrored bar back with six columns, a clock in pedimented centrepiece, a cupboard and a balustrade. There is a panelled dado with re-upholstered original benches attached around most of the room, a Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace, a Lincrusta moulded ceiling, and a deep frieze. Only 3 of originally 7 exterior windows with decoratively etched \u2018Bar\u2019 panels survive, also two side panels in the apex window and two leaded toplights also in the apex.\n\r\nThe former smoke room on the left has lost its door and in the mid 2000\u2019s it lost it original fixed benches around the room and baffles by the doors but does retains its Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace, a Lincrusta frieze and embossed ceiling. It now has now loose furniture including a settee and modern windows have replaced the original etched ones. Service to the smoke room is via a hatch/door to the back of the servery with a decorative etched and frosted panel that looks original.\n\r\nThere was a Club Room on the first floor above the smoke room that also has a decorative cornice and frieze but this is now a private residence. Apart from the loss of the fixed seating in the smoke room, the only other important change is the removal of the vestibule entrance from the Infirmary Walk entrance and short passage beyond which was converted into the ladies toilet in 1993 by Banks\u2019s but it is still possible to see another off sales hatch on the servery side. The mosaic floor at the rear of the passage confirms changes to this area to add the ladies.\n\r\nAlthough there were two doors into the public bar the plans obtained by a former licensee do not indicate any divisions/partitions. Also, the gents has been modernised. After a period as a Bistro and restaurant with no alcohol it reopened in 2013 as a real ale pub but it is only open from Tue to Sat from 12 to 8.",

        "Description": "One of only two licensed buffets on the main UK rail network that has remained this unaltered since before the Second World War (the other being at Stalybridge, Greater Manchester). It occupies part of a two-storey block that was designed in 1922 (built 1925) by the North Eastern Railway's last serving company architect, Stephen Wilkinson, as a careful addition to the 1912 station concourse of his predecessor, William Bell. Its layout of two rooms was to cater separately for the two 'classes' of passenger and it retains all the main elements of the original room interiors. The entire station, with the buffet, was statutorily listed in 2003 following a successful application by CAMRA and the official listing description was enhanced in 2010, again at CAMRA's instigation, to give fuller recognition to the outstanding importance of the Buffet.  \r\n\r\nBuilt of red brick. A corner porch with terrazzo floor leads to the Second Class Refreshment Room at the car park side of the building. It has a terrazzo floor, the tiled and wood surround fireplace is a replacement with a 1970s gas fire and large modern mirror above. The chimneybreast is flanked by two large wooden pilasters which reach to the deep corniced ceiling. The original panelled bar counter sits on an Italian marble base with a marble top and the original two bay bar back fitting has mirrors and some glass shelves from the 1960s. There are two display cases \u2013 one with cakes and the other with British Railways mugs. Original gas lighting has been converted to electric. The crack in the floor was as a result of a train hitting the buffers in the late twentieth century.  \r\n\r\nA door at the rear leads to the First Class Refreshment Room, which has its own entrance from the station concourse where the lobby has original screen-work and inner door. It has a terrazzo floor \u2013 look for the three nails the builders left in the mix when creating it. There is another original bar counter on an Italian marble base which is curved and has a marble top. There is a display case of sweets, chocolates and crisps. An original tiled and wood surround fireplace has a gas fire and replacement large mirror above. The chimneybreast is flanked by two large wooden pilasters which reach to the deep corniced ceiling. The mirrored (replacement) original two-bay bar back has some glass shelves added. The \u2018Station Cat Lucy\u2019 plaque celebrates the 26 year old cat who died in 2014. The walls have lots of railwayana. The floor behind the servery is of wood block. Most of the joinery is original too and the door-frames have decorative architraves. Marble top tables. On the station concourse look for the \u2018Booking Office\u2019 in stone relief. Opens from 8.30 to 6 (Easter to end of September 7.30 to 10.30.",

        "Description": "A rare survivor of the many pubs that lined what was once old Hull\u2019s principal thoroughfare. The premises has had many uses over the years, including tobacco dealing (traditionally symbolised by an Indian Chief - \u2018black boy\u2019!) but the key interest lies in its transition from Victorian wine merchant's to public house whilst retaining much of the layout of the former. \r\n The refitting was done in 1926 for local company T Linsley & Co - the old wine merchant's office becoming the front smoke room, a serving bar installed in the rear room (which itself may have been a warehouse at one time), and the cosy upstairs rooms continuing their function for meetings. Original fittings from 1926 include the downstairs panelling (that upstairs is more recent), bar-counters and front fire surround. \r\n\r\nDesignated a 'Heritage' pub by Tetley's in 1983, it was their only house in East Yorkshire to enjoy this rare acclaim. Threats of alterations in 2001 were averted following CAMRA\u2019s successful application for statutory listing.",

        "Address": "25 Silver Street, Hull, HU1 1JG",
        "Description": "The impressive Olde White Harte has been a licensed premises since the 18th century and has parts dating back to the seventeenth. Its historic interest as a public house, however, derives from a major refurbishment of 1881 by local architects, Smith & Brodrick. Their designs for the downstairs rooms (smoke room to the left, and public bar) used various elements of the original domestic interior but incorporated them into an idealised re-creation of a 17th century \u2018Olde Englishe\u2019 inn, complete with massively enlarged brick fireplaces \u2013 a striking example of a \u2018theme pub\u2019 by the Victorians!!  \r\n\r\nThe 1881 scheme, which also created the lovely decorative glasswork, left the old panelled upstairs rooms largely untouched. These are now reserved mainly for dining and functions but can be viewed at quiet times. One is dubbed the 'Plotting Room' - a Civil War reference to be taken with a pinch of salt, as the building post-dates that conflict. Only one of the downstairs serveries is now in regular use : both have copper counter-tops, possibly from the 1960s. The built-in telephone kiosk in the smoke room, now disused, is a noteworthy survival in itself.",

        "Pub Name": "White Horse",
        "Address": "22 Hengate, Beverley, HU17 8BN",
        "Description": "Something of a Yorkshire institution, \u2018Nellie\u2019s\u2019 is one of the \u2018must-see\u2019 highlights of an old county town that itself abounds with historic interest. A vernacular gem, it has evolved into a warren of varied and distinctive rooms with uneven floors, still with gas lighting and warmed in winter by blazing fires in the old hearths. It was in the tenure of the Collinson family from 1892 and in 1927 Francis Collinson purchased the pub from the church - there was five unmarried sisters and two brothers involved in running the pub - Miss Nellie Collinson ruled as its redoubtable landlady from 1952 to 1975, hence its popular nickname 'Nellies'. \r\n\r\nThe main entrance on Hengate has above it a figure of a horse carved in wood and supported on brackets. From the front door the flagstone passage into the pub has tongue and groove walls, a hatch to bar and the original pub sign 'Nellie Collinson Licenced Retailer Spiritous Liquers Wines Spirits Ale Porter & Tobacco to be Consumed on the Premises' - the passage leads to the main bar on the left and on to the toilets at the rear. \r\n\r\nThe Main Bar has a bare wood floor with old fixed seating all around and the bar counter was only installed with the take-over by the Samuel Smiths Brewery in 1976. Prior to this, sales where dispatched from a table located in the same area. The bar back retains some old wooden shelves. The main fireplace has a Victorian cast-iron interior with colourful tiled paintings but modern stone surround; above is a large old mirror with an ornate wooden surround. Also, near the door to the passage there is also a modern Samuel Smiths bucket-style fireplace with a stone surround and above a small oblong mirror with decorative wood surround. There is an impressive four-lamp gas pulley-controlled chandelier and three other gas lights. The short-cased wall clock in the corner, behind the entrance door is well known for chiming at unusual times, and the wrong amount of chimes! There are four oblong marble top tables with cast iron bases. \r\n\r\nA double doorway sized opening where the doors are folded back leads to the Family Room (or Dart Room) with windows overlooking Hengate It has a bare wooden floor, a Victorian cast-iron, tiled and wood surround fireplace with tiled paintings and mirror in ornate surround above, old fixed bench seating, and five gas lights. In the right-hand corner is one of two piano's which is quite often still played (the other being in the function room - upstairs). Only just visible between the door and the fireplace, is an old wine cooling chest. \r\n\r\nAn ancient door leads to a passage with an uneven tiled floor and two hatches to the back of the servery \u2013 the right hand one has lower rising window for service. Opposite the hatch a door leads to the Ex-No Smoking Room (which also faces onto Hengate). This small room directly left of entrance passageway has a quarry tiled floor laid diagonally, a small Victorian tiled, cast-iron fireplace with a row of tiles along the top and a traditional mirror above. To the left of the fireplace is an old piece of furniture (wall stand?) with an ornate mirror surround, wall cupboards, half-height tongue and groove panelling painted brown, three leather covered benches and 3 gas lights. \r\n\r\nCross the entrance passageway and a doorway leads to a small area with uneven flagstone floor that has the nickname of The Office. It has a sewing machine table and two chairs. On the wall is a large, glass-fronted frame enclosing a large selection of receipts and invoices of local business, dating back to the turn of the century. \nSliding Door room (the sliding door is usually already open) has an uneven black and red tiled floor, has a splendid open range which usually has a coal fire burning during colder weather and high mantelshelf. This small room has high backed leatherette cushioned settle seating on two sides. It has just one large round table with a gaslight over the center and a scrubbed one with two drawers that has an alarming slope so watch your beer if you have a full pint! Also, a piece of leather seating in front of the window overlooking Hengate. \r\n\r\nFurther back is the Scullery with an uneven tiled floor and black-leaded range fireplace and coal scuttle alongside. On the wall opposite is a display of plates, a chest of drawers, two long scrubbed tables. \r\n\r\nBeyond the scullery and up four steps is a pool room added in the 1990's with two pool tables, open rafters and new tongue 'n' groove ceiling, open brick fireplace, modern quarry tiled floor and new half pine panelling. \r\n\r\nBetween the main corridor and the Scullery is the Linen Press room with old quarry tiled floor, a large wooden Press with wooden draws beneath, a mirror in wood surround on the wall and another gas light. \r\n\r\nAccessed by a staircase from the main corridor is the Function Room on the first floor which is also lit entirely by eight gas chandeliers and wall-lights. A large room it has a bare wood floor with some carpets on it and a good wood surround and bucket-style fireplace (age?) with a large mirror.above. Adjacent left to the fireplace is an old upright piano. The function room is regularly occupied with jazz bands, folk singers and poets - folk 1st Sun in every month. A folding partition doors separate a small room with a bare wood floor, possibly old wood surround fireplace and small bar area behind.",

        "Pub Name": "Birch Hall Inn",
        "Address": "Beck Hole, YO22 5LE",
        "Description": "The Birch Hall Inn is a public house-cum-shop whose interior of old-fashioned simplicity is lovingly preserved by its present-day owners who are dedicated to keeping the pub's 'timewarp' character unaltered. Indeed, when they took over the pub in 1981 they happily accepted a condition of sale to do exactly this - imposed by their predecessor and former landlady, Mrs Schofield whose home it had been for 53 years. \r\n\r\nLying in a steep wooded cleft of the North York Moors below Goathland, by an old stone bridge over a moorland beck, the Birch Hall Inn is a gem of a pub in a gem of a setting - an idyllic, tranquil place which is hard to imagine having an industrial past. Yet back in the 1860s Beckhole rang to the clamour of ironstone mines, smelting furnaces, quarries and the Railway, and the three-storey block which forms the right-hand half of the pub premises was in fact built (by the pub landlord of the time) as a shop with tenements above, to cater for the influx of industrial workers. On the front wall is an oil painting of the view up the Ellerbeck from the stone bridge featuring the falls, Thomason Fosse, which was given to Mrs. Schofield in 1944 by Algernon Newton in gratitude for many happy hours spent there. He was a well known artist and member of the esteemed Royal Academy, who occupied the house, formerly the Lord Nelson in Beck Hole which closed in 1940. There are benches on the front and steps to the steep little garden on the right of the pub with its aviary and good views. \r\n\r\nThe original pub, essentially the 'Big Bar' of today, was contained in one of the pair of eighteenth-century cottages to the left (with the whitewashed frontages) and is accessed from a passage. This small basic room has a concrete floor, beam and plank ceiling, wall bench seating with long cushions, a fine early 20th century Tudor-shaped stone fireplace with log fire in winter and may be covered by a settle in summer, and a dart board. A piece of the bench seating has been cut out and hinged near a tiny hatch in the wall to enable customers to stand and get served. The room has only three old narrow oblong cast-iron base tables, which came from the Beck Hole Halt waiting room, and near the hatch is a working gas lamp which is handy in the event of a power cut. \r\n\r\nIt was not until after the Second World War that a second pub room, the 'Little Bar', was formed from part of the shop in the Victorian extension. Essentially a tiny snug, it has three simple benches, a flagstone floor, and one Formica top table with lots of old (1d) pennies inlaid into it. This wood panelled room is painted grey on lower half and bright yellow on the top half, has an aquarium, and lots of nick-nacks on shelves all around the room including some quality items of breweriana. \r\n\r\nThe tiny village shop in the middle has a floor area of only three flagstones and sells lots of sweets including Sherbet Dabs, Pontefract Cakes and Imps also ice creams and postcards. The sweets are still weighed on an old set of scales which uses a 4oz weight and the label on the sweets has to state the price and also the price for 100g equivalent in order to comply with the law! Open all day in summer, in winter it is only open lunchtimes (not Tue) and evenings (not Mon, Tue). \r\n\r\nThe pub is home to the Beckhole Quoit Club which plays the traditional game of outdoor quoits.",

        "Address": "Bilton Lane, Harrogate, Bilton, HG1 4DH",
        "Description": "In a rural valley setting at the very edge of suburban Harrogate, the Gardener's is an old-fashioned alehouse of rare quality in these parts, occupying a delightful little early eighteenth-century vernacular building - stone-built, with stone-mullioned windows, stone-flagged floors and stone slate roof. Though it has moved with the times, developing its food and beer-garden trade, what changes there have been internally have had little effect on the basic layout of the original house. The two principal rooms are, as they always have been, either side of the old central entrance corridor. The lounge, to the right, has solid walls and we can guess that for many years this was the publican's own private 'best room'. \r\n\r\nThe tap room, to the left of the corridor and separated only by a boarded partition wall, is perhaps the part of the building that has been in public use longest. It has old bench seating, an ancient hearth and a seasoned feel. As for the back parts of the building, including the servery area and the games room, the likelihood is that these are former domestic quarters that have been brought into pub use in fairly recent times. For most of its history the Gardener's belonged to the Mountgarrett estate which finally sold it in the 1970s to long-standing tenant, Maurice Johnson. It has been in brewery ownership for little more than a decade. Bilton itself, surprisingly enough, has some history as a mining village and produced coal for Harrogate's earliest gas supply.\r\n\r\nAlterations in 2015 included re-configuring the back stairway, which has affected the size, shape, and character of both the back-left (former games) room and the under-stair area (former snug).",

        "Pub Name": "Christie's Brasserie - The Zetland",
        "Address": "9 Zetland Road, Middlesbrough, TS1 1EH",
        "Description": "Built c.1860 as a pub-cum-hotel, the real interest here is the spectacular lounge added at the rear in 1893, designed by local architect J. M. Bottomley for a private client and described as \u2018luncheon bar\u2019 on the earliest plans. It retains its  superb display of round-arched mirrors with surrounding tilework in cream, browns and light blue, together with an ornamented plaster cornice and frieze. \r\n\r\nThe pub closed in 2015. Bought by Philip & Joanne Christie and in July 2017 they embarked on a  painstaking restoration which included sourcing custom-made tiles from Craven Dunnill Jackfield - the very firm that created the tiles that adorn the walls of the spectacularly mirrored rear dining room over 120 years ago. The pub re-opened in September 2018. \r\n\r\nThe rear room now acts as a dining room so best to visit the pub at a quiet time to be able to view it. \r\n\r\nAll the way around the room is  round-headed ceramic arcading \u2013 five arches on the west and east walls; three on the south and two on the north one. Between each arch are mirrored panels in pilasters with tiling above. The ceramic frieze features waterleaves, shells, cherubs, scrolls and baskets of fruit. There is an egg-and-dart-moulded ceiling cornice. Jacobean-style geometric-panelled plaster ceiling with moulded ribs. \r\n\r\nAlong the west wall the arcading contains  ornate ceramic work and a mirror; also one on the north wall is similarly treated. On the east wall three contain plain plasterwork; two with windows. The south wall arcading also contains windows and the other north one is just plasterwork. Old photos show the lack of mirrors in the round headed arcading on the east wall and to the left of the entrance door\u2013 research would be required to discover the date of change. \r\n\r\nThere was some fixed seating in bays on both the west and south walls but this was removed in 2018; the only seating is now on the south wall and is new. In its place on the west wall there is now a  dado of colourful tiling, some in relief, sourced from Craven Dunnill Jackfield. Prior to closure, there was a large modern servery on the east wall. Now there is a dado of more plainer tiles mainly in claret. \r\n\r\nThe restoration exposed other ornate fittings from the late Victorian times that had been hidden from view for many years. The entrance lobby has a \u2018Zetland Hotel\u2019 mosaic floor. Above it, having been covered by a false ceiling, there is a  splendid tiled ceiling with octagonal centrepiece and ornate cornice. If you go down the passage on the rear right towards the toilets and into the rear lobby there is a skylight with a colourful stained glass sections that is also now able to be admired. Not accessible, there is a toilet upstairs with walls that are completely covered in colourful tiling. \r\n\r\nThe front public bar did have a modern servery on the back wall  but this was removed from its position by the new owners. Now there is a traditional looking bar counter added on the front right hand side. The room has dado panelling that had been hidden for years by fixed seating. The two sets of inner doors in the entrance lobby have been sourced by the Christie\u2019s from elsewhere. In the hallway leading to the rear room dado panelling has been added in the same style as that seen in the bar. \r\n\r\nThe restoration won the Zetland the  Historic England Award for Conservation in the 2019 CAMRA Pub Design Awards.",

        "Pub Name": "Swan",
        "Address": "16 Bishopgate Street, York, YO23 1JH",
        "Description": "The Swan is a near-intact Thirties remodelling of a small Victorian street-corner pub and one of the best-preserved interiors of its kind in the country. It was done to 1936 plans by Kitson, Parish, Ledgard & Pyman, the Leeds architects responsible for much of Tetley's work between the Wars and who helped create a distinctive house-style for the company. A beerhouse since 1861, the Swan had been acquired by Tetley's in 1899. The design here centres on a room-sized stand-up lobby - reflecting a distinct West Riding influence on the part of both architect and client - and it has a room-off at either end of the central servery (the 'better' smoke room to the rear) each served by hatch. The unaltered layout and it\u2019s authentic fabric like the fitted seating, bell-pushes, leaded and glazed screenwork, terrazzo flooring - even the toilet ceramics - help make this a memorable 1930s survival. \r\n\r\nThe porch has a terrazzo floor, 1930's wall tiling and set of double doors with 1930 leaded panels. The terrazzo floor lobby is served from a bar set back on the left with glazed leaded screen above, shelving on walls and a couple of small round tables. In the 1980s the lobby bar saw some changes and a dado of wood-like substance added to the counter front so it looks modern. The passage goes right to the back of the pub with more shelving at the back and leads to one of the most intact/impressive 1930s gents\u2019 toilets with a dado tiled wall, tiled floor and 4 massive urinals.  \r\n\r\nA 1930s door leads into the front left public bar which also has a terrazzo floor, 1930s fixed seating all around with bell-pushes, and a hatch to the side of the servery. The rear smoke room has a door, dado panelling, original fixed seating with bell pushes in the panel above. There is a doorway with a flap making it like a hatch to the side of the servery and also access to the servery for staff. The Victorian-style tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace possibly added in the 1980s by Tetley's is one of few modern touches. As well as The Swan was given Tetley's 'Heritage' badging in 1985 and it was statutorily listed in 2010 following a successful application by CAMRA.",

        "Pub Name": "Golden Ball",
        "Address": "2 Cromwell Road, York, YO1 6DU",
        "Description": "A 1929 remodelling of a small Victorian local by the Tadcaster brewers John Smith's under their long-serving company architect, Bertram Wilson. This is thought to be the most complete surviving example of an inter-war scheme by a company who were becoming one of the UK's biggest regional brewers. Their legacy at the Golden Ball is an interior which, though surprisingly conservative in style for the time, was unusual in its planning - with only one entrance to the drinking areas and an intimate little bar-side 'hall' of which no other similar example is known. This is an early 19th century two-storey building with an 1883 extension. Through the lobby with its 1920's tiling to dado height and terrazzo floor, and situated on the right with a doorway gap it also has a terrazzo floor, a 'The Golden Ball Inn' etched windows and 1930s fixed seating with service from a small bar and doorway/hatch for staff. \r\n\r\nAt the rear left is the little altered since Victorian times smoke room with a figure '2' on the door, Victorian fixed seating all around the room with bell pushes, a Victorian tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace and a baffle either side of the door. The 1929 scheme also created the corner off-sales (now defunct) with a dado of 1930s tiled walls and a hatch/doorway to the side of the servery and the public bar's rare tiled counter-front. \r\n\r\nThe main bar with a figure '3' on the door and lino floor has a rare tiled counter-front from 1929 of mainly cream tiles with a ribbon bands of black and orange tiles and some geometric square tiles near the top, the original 1929 bar back with glazed panels in the central section and beyond it is the steps to the cellar!. The fixed seating and wood surround with modern brick infill fireplace is also from 1929, a 'Moors & Robson's Pale & Mild Ales' mirror, and this room still retains three of 1929 'John Smith's' 'Magnet Ales' etched windows and another one with a pattern. \r\n\r\nThe only substantial post-war change has been the 1990s creation of an extra room from private quarters. Situated on the left of the entrance it has a tiled and marble surround fireplace from the early 20th century, some modern fixed seating and a bar billiards table. The original outside gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets (now covered over) have been retained and have some 1930s dado tiling. The distinctive brown glazed brick and tiled exterior including the 'John Smiths Tadcaster Ales & Stouts' fascia on the Victor Street side, 'Entrance', 'The Golden Ball' and 'Jug & Bottle Dept' on the Cromwell Road side were all added as part of the 1929 scheme.

This was a remodelling by the Grimsby brewers, Hewitt Brothers Ltd, who were Doncaster\u2019s biggest pub owners for many years following their 1881 family takeover of the local Exchange Brewery. Their legacy here is a straightforward but pleasing little design of front bar, side corridor and back lounge (labelled 'music room' on the plans).  \r\n\r\nApart from the modern fireplaces in both rooms and missing side panels from the serving 'hatch' to the lounge, there is little to detract from the pub\u2019s authentic Thirties character. Leaded glasswork, wall-coverings and fittings typical of the period are much in evidence, including the fixed seating with bell-pushes in the lounge and the bar-counter with its horizontal banding. (The latter appears to have been built larger than shown on the plans). CAMRA sought statutory listing in 2009, but without  success.",

        "Address": "66-68 Victoria Street, Sheffield, City Centre, S3 7QL",
        "Description": "The Bath Hotel is an unusually complete example of a Sheffield corner public house, which retains, in almost complete form, the 1931 plan and fittings.\n\r\nOn the end of a mid-Victorian terrace and set in the sharp angle between two streets. At one time it appears to have doubled as a grocers and a beerhouse. The first recorded use of the name 'Bath Hotel' was in 1908 coming from the nearby Glossop Street Baths built in 1836. Ind Coope bought the pub around the time of the First World War and remodelled the interior in 1931 (James E.Knight & Co. for Messrs Ind Coope & Co.Ltd.) extending the pub part into what presumably had been the grocers. By 1930, this had become living quarters. What we have today is scarcely altered since 1931 apart from the loss of the off-sales (hence the disused doorway on Victoria Street) but the space remains and is used for storage. Note the raised lettering, 'The Bath Hotel' set within a painted panel on the apex side above the stained and leaded 'Bath Hotel' exterior window, and on Victoria Street side a 'Tetley Heritage Inn' plaque.\n\r\nThe public bar has a vestibule entrance with a dado of inter-war yellow and brown tiling and quarry tiled floor but the inner door is missing. It retains the counter installed in 1931 with a front that is unusual in that it is faced with orangey-brown tiles and also has leaded glazing above. It retains its original seating of two large bays with a low glazed screen on top of where the seating meets and a 1930s brick fireplace.\n\r\nA door leads into a corridor that runs to the door on Convent Way and retains its original black and white floor tiling and more inter-war yellow and brown tiling on the dado on one side - on the opposite side some of the tiles have been painted over. Off the corridor the door to the servery has a '2' on it and a small service counter. The shelf on one wall indicates that customers still partake in very traditional passageway drinking. The former ladies toilet opposite the bar is now a small kitchen and the passage continues to the new toilets with a modern tiled dado.\n\r\nIn the sharp angle of the streets is the triangular shaped smoke room with the figure '1' on the door, more original fixed seating which until 2001 did have the makers 'Lawn & Howarth of Blackpool' tags (two tags in the bar have the name now rubbed off). The fireplace is of glazed brick, cast iron and with a wood surround and coal fire. There is a baffle / screen with glazed panel situated at the end of the seating by the hatch servery that has a leaded window above.\n\r\nThe pub had a refurbishment in late 2001 and the work is a model of its kind - it won the CAMRA/English Heritage 2003 Pub Design Award for conservation. The place was cleaned and decorated, the green paint stripped off some of the tiles in the corridor and everything brought back to pristine order. The floor in the larger bar was laid with new diamond shaped brown and cream tiles, the previous tiled floor having become unsound.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2016. \u2028Converted to an unlicensed cafe and therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nCorner pub erected during the 1820s and enlarged into an adjoining property during the middle years of the century and elaborately refurbished around 1900 with five rooms. The corner doorway is flanked by large shop-style front windows and leads into a long tap room (now serving as a restaurant) with an elaborately decorated bar back and counter which face substantial fitted seating along the other walls. Additional splendour is created by the extensive use of cut, etched and leaded glass, both in the exterior windows and internal screens which divide the tap room from the rest of the premises. (The screen which formerly separated a tiny jug & bottle from the main bar has been removed). \n\nAccess to the rest of the premises is via a separate entrance in Barkerend Road, where a cosy lounge bar contains a second impressive mahogany bar back and counter together with other fine appurtenances. Facing the main entrance is an intimate 'Bradford style' snug whilst a short corridor to the left leads to a second snug : each is similarly furnished with high quality fittings. A concert room of more contemporary style lies beyond.",

        "Address": "171 Westgate, Bradford, BD1 3AA",
        "Description": "The New Beehive blends elements of its original late Victorian interior with a 1936 remodelling by William Whitaker & Co, one of Bradford's leading brewers of the inter-war era. It was rebuilt in 1901 as part of the municipal improvement of Westgate (replacing an old coaching inn) and the plans for its construction were drawn up by the city architect & surveyor of the time, J H Cox.\n\r\nThe original three rooms are to a typical 'house' plan, with the central corridor elaborated into a drinking hallway. In the front public bar, the curving oak bar-counter, arcaded back-fitting and bench seating are all fittings from the 1901 scheme. The old fabric and d\u00e9cor elsewhere is from the 1936 refurbishment and seen at its best in the back-left smoke room and the panelled hallway lobby. The gents' toilet, the tiled corridor to it, and the back concert room (now lacking in original fittings) are also of 1936. CAMRA sought statutory listing in 2009, but without success.",

        "Description": "The Three Pigeons is among the best-surviving Art Deco pub interiors in England. Rebuilt in 1932 for Samuel Webster & Sons brewery (architects were Jackson and Fox of Halifax) of sandstone 'bricks' - at the top look for a sculpture in white stone of three pigeons. Art Deco was favoured for the Three Pigeons and with much of it remaining the interior is something particularly rare and special. A sensitive refurbishment by the current owners won the pub the CAMRA / English Heritage Conservation Award and the Joe Goodwin Conservation Award in the 2006 CAMRA Pub Design Awards. \r\n\r\nFront door inner lobby has full height original oak veneer panelled walls and a terrazzo floor. Original Inner door retains its multiple Art Deco frosted panels with an overlight and beyond is a short passage with original oak veneer panelled walls to two-thirds height. Through a plain glazed door is the octagonal domed 'hall', a central drinking lobby with a terrazzo floor of a geometric design in buff and green that forms an impressive little centrepiece from which three rooms and the serving area all radiate. The walls of the lobby bar have original oak veneer panelling but the original geometric decoration of the lobby ceiling was replaced by a mural of pigeons on a roof executed in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nThe counter on the rear left in the 'hall' retains its original oak veneer panelled counter front but the top looks modern. The original bar back fitting consists of two display units at right angles to each other and with distinct Art Deco detailing and mirrored panels. To the right a mirror has the lettering advertising \u2018Green Label The Perfect Beer\u2019. High up to the right near the entrance for staff is the original bell box with windows labelled \u2018Front Door\u2019, \u2018Back Door\u2019, \u2018Hall\u2019, \u2018Sitting Room\u2019, \u2018Bedroom 1\u2019, \u2018Lounge 1\u2019, \u20182\u2019, and a blank one. \r\n\r\nThe front right small lounge retains most of its original fixed seating which curves around the bay window, bell pushes above and the original 1930s fireplace surround but the tiles are modern additions, it has a modern linoleum floor and it has lost its door. \r\n\r\nThe front left small lounge has its original oak veneer door with metal framed sub-rectangular glazed panel with a classic Art Deco \u2018Bar Lounge\u2019 wording in metal ribbon lettering across the glazing. The room retains original fixed seating which curves around the bay window, bell pushes above and an excellent Art Deco wood surround fireplace but the tiled interior is modern and it has a modern linoleum floor. The original counter front has oak veneer fluted pilasters but the glazed panels above are modern. On the wall is the newspaper advert announcing the pub opening with both the original and replacement pub illustrated. \r\n\r\nThe rear right small tap room has its original oak veneer door with metal framed sub-rectangular glazed panel which has, sadly, in recent years, lost its \u2018Tap Room\u2019 wording in metal ribbon lettering across the glazing. It retains the original fixed seating all around the room, and here is an intact original Art Deco wood surround fireplace with glazed brick interior \u2013 note the 11 square ones with animal designs in relief on them. This room also has a modern linoleum floor and two holes have been cut in the top half of the walls to the front right room and the passage on the left \u2018for supervision purposes\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe floor of the passage has terrazzo flooring and more original oak veneer panelling to two-thirds height. There is a hatch/door for staff to the servery then the toilets. Ladies has terrazzo tiled floor and original oak veneer panelling to two-thirds height on the wall of the ante-room. The original oak veneer door with metal framed sub-rectangular glazed panel remains with its classic Art Deco \u2018Ladies\u2019 wording in metal ribbon lettering across the glazing but the wall tiles beyond are modern. The gents also has a terrazzo tiled floor and original oak veneer panelling to two-thirds height on the wall of the ante-room. The original oak veneer door with metal framed sub-rectangular glazed panel remains but has lost it \u2018Gents\u2019 Art Deco wording and the toilet fittings are all modern.

        "Description": "Almost a textbook example of how a pub can undergo enormous enlargement without too seriously compromising its historic core. The old core here is the marvellous little time-worn, wood-panelled arrangement of front bar, corridor entrance, and front snug which originated from cottages in 1841. This formed the entire extent of the pub before the Second World War and it still functions as the \u2018pub\u2019 heart of a pub-restaurant that has expanded into adjoining domestic, stabling and barn accommodation and spawned a huge conservatory. The right-side lounge, although a post-war conversion, has some attractive adornments of its own \u2013 fireplaces made of salvaged materials from Heath Old Hall and a carved coat of arms of 1980s vintage. The King's Arms has over thirty working gaslights \u2013 most of them modern, but possibly the largest number in any UK pub.",

        "Description": "The Adelphi stands prominently at the southern edge of Leeds city centre, where Briggate crosses the River Aire. Its tall curving brick-built frontage, granite-clad at ground floor and with sandstone detailing, makes it the most imposing, outwardly, of Leeds' surviving late Victorian 'gin palaces'. It was built as a pub and hotel in 1901 to designs by Thomas Winn, a local commercial architect who was also responsible for the Cardigan Arms and the Rising Sun. Inside, the Adelphi preserves its multi-roomed interior and much of its original etched glasswork, joinery and tiling. \r\n\r\nThe main entrance is to a central lobby drinking area, with tiled walls, original terrazzo floor and a grandly-rising open staircase which is itself nicely detailed. To the right is a large front lounge and smaller rear saloon, both with impressive original fireplaces. To the left, the large public bar with its extensive curved counter was sub-divided in the 1980s with a sympathetically designed wood screen. Both the front rooms are lit by large fine etched glass windows. Upstairs is a sizeable function room of plain design, once a ballroom, and additional floors which are no longer used. The Adelphi was given recognition by Tetleys in 1978 as one of their first 'Heritage Inns'.",

        "Pub Name": "Whitelock's Ale House",
        "Address": "Turk's Head Yard, Leeds, City Centre, LS1 6HB",
        "Description": "Whitelock's is something of a Leeds 'institution' and is one of that special breed of old-style luncheon bars that only a few of our biggest cities can still boast. Tucked in the heart of the city centre, it occupies a line of what were late eighteenth-century tenements built on an old burgage plot yard behind Briggate, and all this reflects in its confined setting and long, narrow plan-form. The yard itself, still a thoroughfare, acts as a drinking area for the often crowded pub.\n\r\nProperly called the 'Turk's Head', this is one of Leeds' oldest drinking establishments and dates back to 1715, but the pub we see today is essentially late Victorian - the result of the extensive makeover and remodelling which the Whitelock family gave to the property soon after they acquired it in 1880. (It stayed in the family's hands for many years thereafter and the assumed name, 'Whitelock's', has firmly stuck). Internally, the combination of narrow shape, dark wood panelling and abundant mirrors (many of them celebrating old breweries) creates a unique environment. The long main bar glints with mirrors and brass fittings and the bar counter is topped with copper and fronted with coloured glazed tiles.\n\r\nThe seating areas, partitioned into shallow stalls with ceiling-high brass posts, are part of the original design though the coloured leaded windows are of later, possibly 1920s, date. The ambience continues through to the adjoining dining section where old-fashioned comforts like waitress-service and tablecloths are still provided. A separate bar, further along the yard, is of much more recent origin. As at December 2015 the neglected function room was being converted into a real ale bar.",

        "Pub Name": "Cardigan Arms",
        "Address": "364 Kirkstall Road, Leeds, Burley, LS4 2HQ",
        "Description": "The development of dense streets of back-to-back housing on this part of Lord Cardigan's Leeds estate began in the 1870s, and when the Cardigan Arms was constructed in 1893-5 it was as the centrepiece of a thriving artisan suburb. The proprietor of the pub was Benjamin Greaves who employed architect Thomas Winn, a trustee of the Leeds Licensed Victuallers' Association.\u00a0Built on a corner site about a mile from Leeds city centre,\u00a0the pub's\u00a0nicely-detailed gritstone fa\u00e7ades nowadays lend welcome adornment to workaday Kirkstall Road. \r\n\r\nThe Cardigan is one of a local trio, with the Adelphi and the nearby Rising Sun - all very well preserved late Victorian drinking palaces designed by Leeds architect Thomas Winn. It is perhaps the most internally complex of the three, with three lounges of different sizes off a central L-shaped drinking lobby, a separate public bar that was formerly sub-divided with a 'Ladies Only' section ( still proclaimed in etched glass in the side door panel), and an upstairs function room, the \"Harmonic Room\", accessed via an open staircase from the central lobby. \r\n\r\nThe interior retains much of its as-built d\u00e9cor and fittings, and displays fine woodwork, extensive use of etched glass, mosaic panels in both entrances and original ceiling mouldings and wall-coverings. Outbuildings to the rear include a stable block and the shell of a small tower brewery which has long ceased brewing. There are also signs of a 1930s makeover \u2013 e.g. the woodwork in the Oak Room and tiling in the right-hand corridor and the gents' \u2013 and the bar-fittings are from restoration work in the 1980s by its long-time owners, Joshua Tetley & Son, who gave this fine pub their 'Heritage' badging in1989.  Statutorily listed in 1998 following CAMRA\u2019s Leeds pilot study for English Heritage.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2016: Flood damage has stained the floor, two back room ceilings have been repaired, two etched windows in the Vaults have been smashed, and three leaded lights in the poolroom have been replaced with frosted glass.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2017. \u2028Closed 2009. Reopened as a furniture store: a fire in 2013 did some damage. UPDATE 2020 Subsequent plans to convert the ground floor to a coffee bar and lounge seem to have stalled and the building continues to deteriorate. This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nThe Rising Sun is the least ornate of the three Thomas Winn-designed 'gin palaces' that have survived well in Leeds (the others being the Adelphi and the nearby Cardigan Arms). It dates from 1899 and having outlasted the surrounding late-Victorian housing it was built to serve, it now stands on its own beside the busy Kirkstall Road, within a mile of Leeds city centre. It is built of red brick with restrained stone and terracotta detailing and its large shopfront style external windows with fine etched glass are an impressive feature. Purpose-designed for a corner site, it has entrance doors on two sides and a linking L-shaped corridor-cum-lobby is a main element of its internal planning. A splendid curving wood and glass screen divides the corridor from the corner Tap Room, which is the pub's most spacious room and has a plain wood bar and mirrored back-fitting.\n\nSash windows in the bar screen provide hatch-service to the corridor and to the three smaller public rooms that lead off it. The general d\u00e9cor is simpler than many pubs of this age, with plain glass in the internal screens and grained woodwork in the bar, but it is in an almost untouched original state. So too are the panelled doors and fireplaces, and there is a good original terrazzo floor with mosaic \"Rising Sun\" name and motif at both entrances. Tetleys recognised the pub's special historic merits by designating it as one of their 'Heritage Inns'.\n\nSadly, the pub is currently closed and the building is being used as a furniture shop.  This does at least, however, mean that the interior can be viewed when the shop is open.",

        "Pub Name": "Garden Gate",
        "Address": "3 Whitfield Place, Leeds, Hunslet, LS10 2QB",
        "Description": "Narrowly saved from demolition in 1972 when the entire surrounding area was cleared, the Garden Gate is a treasure house of turn-of-century decorative design - virtually unaltered since it was built in 1903 (though the small tower brewery that once stood at the back is long gone). It is described in its statutory listing as combining \"the plan of a small late Victorian/ Edwardian public house (counter in the vault, hatchways to other rooms) with a decorative treatment which rivals that of much larger city centre 'gin palaces' of the period\". \r\n\r\nIt indeed has a simple traditional layout but a wealth of internal riches that include lavish tiling, fa\u00efence and etched glass with art nouveau motifs, mosaic floors, moulded plasterwork and ornate mahogany fitments. All the glazed ceramic work, used to such wonderful effect inside and out, would have come from the Leeds Fireclay Company and another local firm, J Claughton of Hunslet, had a major hand in the internal furnishing (clearly evidenced by their maker's plaque on the fitted seating of the rear left Smoke Room). The Garden Gate passed into Tetley's ownership in 1964 and was made one of their very first 'Heritage Inns' for its outstanding historic interest. \r\n\r\nThe frontage is extensively clad with ornate ceramic work. The layout has a central corridor, served by hatch from the Vaults, and is flanked by glazed wooden screen walls and to the right are two lounges or saloons. The front door leads to a porch with a \u2018Garden Gate\u2019 mosaic floor and floor to ceiling tiling in green and cream. Double doors have 'Garden' and 'Gate' deep etched and frosted panels in them. The central corridor also has a mosaic floor and tiling on the walls. The partition walls on the left have an excellent display of etched and frosted glass panels. \r\n\r\nThe jewel in the entire crown is the Vaults on the left, which is a veritable tour de force of the decorative tiler's art. Through the door with an Edwardian etched glass \u2018Vaults\u2019 panel you find floor to ceiling tiling in cream, green and yellows, topped by a decorative frieze. The floor is completely covered in mosaic and there is a fine moulded ceiling. The room is dominated by a magnificent curved ceramic bar counter \u2013 one of only fourteen remaining in the whole of the UK - and an equally rare ceramic green Edwardian fireplace. Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe servery has an ornate mahogany bar-back fitting with mirrored panels and a drawer. Original leatherette fixed bench seating remains as does two good baffles by the door with decorative etched and frosted panels in the top. \r\n\r\nThe Tap Room on front right is wedge shaped at street end and has 'Tap Room' in decorative etched and frosted glass on the door",

        "Description": "Rebuilt in 1931 by Melbourne Brewery to drawings by Pontefract architects Garside & Pennington. It is of red brick with dark green glazed stone on the ground floor frontage, white marble 'Marmo' cladding and detailing, and the name Beech Hotel in relief lettering over each ground floor window. Old Melbourne signage is still much in evidence - look for the splendid 'Melbournes Ales' mosaic in brown on yellow on both the left and right hand return sides of the pub. The inter-War design scheme is still substantially intact, including many of the original fittings and finishes. \r\n\r\nThe front door leads to a lobby with a dado of inter-war cream and green tiling and a quarry tiled floor. It has two doors - up to 1995 customers used the left one then because of the position of the darts it was changed to only using the right hand one which leads to the spacious front Vaults.  \r\n\r\nThe Vaults is virtually as-built with a quarry tiled floor, original bar counter with a panelled wooden front with rounded corners and around the base is a terrazzo trough but the counter top is later. The bar back fittings are also original with a matching decorative motif to that on the bar front. The only changes are the addition of the customary modern pot-rail and other paraphernalia that now over-sails the bar counter. On the left and also on the right are good inter-war wood surround fireplaces with modern tiled interiors and in the case of the right hand one a log fire in winter. The original fixed seating remains all around the room with bell pushes above. \r\n\r\nOn the left hand side situated just beyond the Vaults you can still see the former outsales compartment consisting of a short passage with a quarry tiled floor and dado of inter-war cream and green tiling - this is now used as a glass washing area. A door to the rear right of the Vaults leads to a corridor with (post-war) half-panelled walls and a hatch to the back of the servery. On the right hand side is a second, side-lane entrance with a small lobby having a terrazzo floor and green and white tiled walls. The inner door has the unusual wording of 'Smoke Room Entrance' in gold on a frosted panel. \r\n\r\nThe middle Smoke Room has original fixed seating and bell pushes all around the room, a baffle by the doorway, an original Art Deco fireplace surround with glazed brick interior, two 'Smoke Room' with a Melbourne symbol etched windows and a door with (modern) shelf for service to the back of the servery. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the corridor is a large elongated Club Room with a vaulted ceiling lies further beyond and has a doorway, original fixed seating and two original wood surround fireplaces with modern tiled blocked-up interiors. The only change is the addition of a window inserted into the wall between the club room and smoke room no doubt in order to satisfy local magistrates request for 'supervision' purposes so the far room is visible from the front bar. \r\n\r\nOriginal tiling remains in the front part of the gents' and in the WC but there are modern tiles around the replacement urinals.",

The former description is shown below. \n\nA red brick and terracotta corner pub built for Holt's Brewery in 1904 during their great period of expansion. The pub has had minimal investment over the years and remains largely unaltered. Even the stable block in the back yard has stayed intact. The lobby bar has a terrazzo floor stretching from the door on Barton Lane to the entrance on Corporation Road. It has an impressive screened servery with sliding hatches most of which are still intact and held in the upright position. The hatches serve three rooms - the News Room, Bar Parlour and former Billiard Room. The lobby is lined with a dado of dark green Art Nouveau tiles. A fireplace in the corner is original but the tiles are modern. The tiling continues up the staircase and along a passage to the former Billiard Room (but on one side the tiles are modern). \n\nThe large Vault (on etched glass panel in door) still has a separate entrance,  a terrazzo floor and a long bar counter. The richly detailed bar counter has mahogany screens with cut and etched glass. In a corner of the vault was a virtually intact outdoor department but this was removed in 2001 - the terrazzo floor indicates where it was and the door panel 'Outdoor Dept.' now resides in a short screen. The fixed seating where the off sales was situated is modern but matches the other original seating. The pot shelf is modern as is the fireplace but both look to be of some age. \n\nThe inner door on the Barton Lane side has a 'Royal Oak Hotel' etched panel. Front door on the left has a 'News Room' etched panel and leads to a room which retains original fixed seating, but has lost its fireplace and has plain windows. The 'Billiard Room' has a etched panel in the door, fixed seating around most of the room remains as does a number of windows.

        "Description": "This intact, small, street-corner local is probably late nineteenth-century but seems to have been remodelled some time after Joseph Holt's took it over in about 1910 from Wilson's Brewery. The entrance is from the side door on Eliza Ann Street; a corner door facing Liverpool road is now disused. There are several etched windows. The drinkers' lobby-corridor is L-shaped, and separates the front vault and servery from the rear two rooms. The corridor features attractive green tilework: old glazed counter screens to the servery. The small front vault has two old benches (each side of the old corner door), and an old counter of irregular shape, though the bar shelves are probably 1960s and the fireplace has gone. \r\n\r\nOver the passage is the separate smoke room, which has retained its doorway but lost the door; there are original fixed benches and bell-pushes all around the room, but the fireplace is modern. A former cottage at the rear has been incorporated into the pub creating a small rear room, which is the former kitchen still retaining its cast-iron range fireplace. Its door has 'Private' in etched glass. Intact gents' has 3 big urinals, dado tiled walls and tiled floor.",

        "Address": "36 Princes Street, Stockport, SK1 1RY",
        "Description": "A three-storey narrow pub re-built in 1926, just before Robinson's Brewery bought it, which retains a little altered interior consisting of a lobby bar on the right-hand side and two rooms either side of a centrally situated servery. \r\n\r\nThe small entrance lobby has a dado of tiles and fielded panelling above.  On the left in a part glazed screen/partition wall is a door with a brass handle, the figure '2' on it and a rectangular overlight of etched and brilliant cut glass which leads into the small 'vault' or public bar. It retains its original oak panelling on the bar counter front and partition wall but the panels on the opposite and front walls were added in c.2009 and cover up an original fireplace. The bar back fitting is largely intact apart from the insertion of fridges but the pot shelf is modern. \r\n\r\nFrom the lobby the inner door, also with a brass handle and the figure '1' on it with a rectangular overlight of etched and brilliant cut glass, leads into a corridor running the length of building. It has oak panelling throughout with a plain moulded cornice above, and is angled to widen in front of the servery on the left. Note the shelves in the front section of the corridor for stand-up drinking. A door with a figure '5' on it leads to the cellar. On the right is a ladies lavatory which retains its original white, black and orange tiling and a c.1930 illuminated sign in the corridor. Further back is an oak stair, with wall panelling to dado level, leading to the publicans private accommodation. At the far end of the corridor is a stained glass panel depicting a swan with 2 necks. \r\n\r\nBeyond the servery on left is a door with a figure '3' on it and 'Smoke Room' brass sign above the doorway leads into a special room with a warm, comfortable atmosphere. It has a light oak draught/lobby screen as you enter and oak wall panelling all the way around the room with plain moulded cornice above. It retains its original fixed upholstered seating with bell pushes set into panelling, a stone Tudor-style fireplace and is top lit by a colourful glazed rectangular lantern. \r\n\r\nAt the rear on the left a door leads to another small room with parquet floor and an inappropriate Victorian-style tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace with a gas 'coal' fire. The room was brought into pub use in the 1960s (?) and has fixed seating and lino inlaid square tables from this date, also an old chest of drawers. The original outside gents remain intact with white glazed walls and three big urinals.",

        "Address": "2 Game Street, Wheelock, CW11 3RR",
        "Description": "UPDATE 2016. \u2028Planning consent granted for change of use from A4 to Sui Generis and for conversion of the games room to a pet care day facility. This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nAn elegant pub in the centre of this large village. It dates back to about 1805 but has a later extension to the right. The older part has a dignified, Georgian facade, the centre part of which is brought slightly forward under a pedimented gable. The entrance is slightly off-centre to the left and has a fine Classical door surround and a Gothic tracery fanlight. the ground floor windows are a distressing mid/late twentieth century alteration - just compare them to the real thing above. \n\nInside there are four public rooms and it is little altered since a refitting in the inter-war years by Birkenhead Brewery - the date of the handpumps is 1939 so this may be the date of the refit. The major change is the removal of a partition that surrounded the public bar and separated it from the passage. There is a photo in the pub that shows the partition reached to the ceiling, has a door in it where the gap between the public bar and passage is now, and there was a hatch with a window at the side of the servery that gave service to customers in the corridor and snooker room.  \n\nThe public bar has a bar back fitting with a row of leaded glass fronted cupboards at the top and bar counter front of distinct inter-war style. The fireplace with a deep red glazed brick interior has a wood surround in Art Deco style; the fixed seating dates from the 1930s and there is a fine vestibule entrance from the street that is much older. \n\nThe bar parlour with wording etched on the door has more c.1939 fittings. The fixed seating has draught screens at both ends near the door with leaded panels in the top, another deep red glazed brick fireplace with an Art Deco style wood surround and there is a bar counter for service from the back of the servery. Note the good decorative wooden strip above the fixed seating which has bell pushes spaced regularly all around the room. \n\nThe passageway has a red quarry tiled floor near the public bar with the toilets off. Both the inter-war gents' with three big urinals and ladies' are intact with tiled walls - even the Birkenhead Brewery 'use with care' notices remain! On the far right there is a large room still with its full-sized table in regular use - borrow the cue and the balls from behind the bar and pay 20p for 15 minutes light - and excellent Victorian fitted seating around three sides of the room. There is another glazed deep red brick and wood surround fireplace. On the far left is a room with another glazed deep red brick fireplace that was previously private quarters (and may in future house the billiard table).\n\nOther Heritage pubs still with full sized billiard tables are the \nLamb, Eccles, Greater Manchester; the Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; and the Douglas Arms, Bethesda, North Wales.",

        "Pub Name": "Crown",
        "Address": "46 Great Victoria Street, Belfast, BT2 7BA",
        "Description": "No visit to Northern Ireland would be complete without a trip to the Crown. It is, after the Philharmonic in Liverpool, the most spectacular pub in the British Isles and is a true masterpiece of Victorian furnishing and decoration. Inside is a treasure house of tiles, glass, lavish woodwork and includes an extraordinary tiled bar counter in a setting of 10 snugs which is unique to Northern Ireland . The building was put up in the 1840s and became the Railway Tavern in 1849, shortly after the opening of the Great Northern Railway terminus opposite. In 1885 it was bought by Michael Flanagan and his son Patrick, a student of architecture, was responsible for the decision to subject the pub to an amazingly opulent refurbishment designed by Belfast architects E and J Byrne. The exterior of polychromatic tiling was added in 1898 and is the work of Craven Dunnill. \r\n\r\nThe ground floor exterior fa\u00e7ade is covered in colourful tiles and there are also Classical columns and pilasters, portholes and stained glass windows which gives a hint of the treasures within. The fascia has the wording 'Liquor ... The Crown ... Saloon' which has given rise to the pub often being mistakenly referred to as 'The Crown Liquor Saloon: the proper, simpler name is boldly painted at high level - 'THE CROWN BAR'. Look for the reversed letter 'A' in 'Vaults' on Great Victoria Street side and the 'Q' in 'Liquors' on Amelia Street side. In the entrance porch the mosaic floor with the words 'Crown Bar' around a crown gave rise to the saying that here is a place where you can trample on the British crown with impunity. \r\n\r\nThe National Trust bought this exotic property in 1978 (Sir John Betjeman, the late Poet Laureate, played a crucial role in the Trust\u2019s decision.) In 1981 the Trust carried out a sympathetic restoration, and it took the sum of approximately \u00a3400,000 to restore the bar to its full Victorian splendour. Battered by over 30 blasts (it is situated opposite the Europa Hotel, the most bombed hotel in Europe) its stained glass windows had been shattered many times. Stills from the 1947 film Odd Man Out were used to help create the lost plasterwork and stained glass; gas lighting was re-installed, and the moulds for the 1885 tiles were discovered at the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire.  The opening ceremony was performed by TV newsreader Angela Rippon. \r\n\r\nWhat makes the interior so distinctive is the row of small drinking snugs ranged opposite the counter  - you will find similar ones (or traces of them) at other pubs in Z Northern Ireland but nowhere else, The Crown has the most ornate of all the Northern Irish snugs \u2013 the other best remaining examples of snugs in Z Northern Ireland are at the Rock, Belfast, Z Northern Ireland; Ronnie Drew's, Belfast, Z Northern Ireland; Mandeville Arms, Portadown; Fort Bar, West Belfast; Blakes of the Hollow, Enniskillen and the rare survivor Carraghers, Camlough, Co. Armagh being a small village pub. The idea was to give customers some privacy and they could order drinks and food to be brought to them by pressing a bell-push. You still can lunchtimes as waiter service is available Mon-Sat 12 noon-3pm; and 12.30 to 4 Sun - find an empty snug and a member of staff will come and take your order by pressing the bell \u2013 all of them still work. You will see a superbly decorated unique rectangular bell box halfway down the bar with the letters A to J: which relate to the various snugs. Pressing a bell makes a disc move in the respective window to show where service is required. You'll search in vain for snug J - it was removed in the 1970s to give access to the Crown Dining Rooms upstairs \u2013 you can still see part of the partition wall complete with its \u2018matches\u2019 strikers as a dado on the wall either side of the front door to the ladies toilet. \r\n\r\nEach snug entrance is guarded by carved griffins and lions holding armorial shields inscribed with Latin inscriptions like \u2018Verus Amor Patria\u2019 (Love Your Country); Audentis Fortuna Juvat\u2019 (Fortune Favours the Brave). Each snug has leather-covered benches all around the partitioned walls with a gunmetal plate for striking matches, a bell push, a black and white tiled floor, and one oblong table. The front wall of each snug has colourful painted glass panels \u2013 also in the doors where the centre circular panel has an individual letter. A row of bevelled mirrors within the snugs have paintings of shells, fleurs-de-lys, fairies, pineapples and clowns. At the base of the exterior of all the snug partition walls is a row of colourful Victorian tiles and above them are carved wooden panels. It may be possible to book a snug for lunchtime dining, otherwise to be sure of drinking in a snug it is best to visit the Crown at non-busy times such as early morning, mid-afternoon and late weekday evenings. \r\n\r\nExpense was certainly not spared by the Victorians in fitting out the Crown, as is shown by the spectacular ceramic counter, one of only thirteen such in the British Isles. It was made by the Shropshire firm of Craven Dunnill and probably dates from around 1898. Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; \r\nGarden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; and Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; \r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. The bar top is of red granite. There are three heavily carved short screens attached to the bar counter \u2013 each features two arch shaped plain mirror panels both sides over which is a semi-circular emblature topped by an urn. \r\n\r\nThe impressive eight-bay bar-back fitting is the most ornate in Northern Ireland with its wording of 'Bonders of Old High Class Whiskies Direct Importers Sandeman\u2019s Special Wines' along the top. Four of the bar-back bays have gilded and decorated mirror panels and three bays are filled with three casks \u2013 originally these would have held whiskey etc. Under two of the sets of three casks in the bar back fitting you will see two banks of seven spirit cocks which also used to dispense such drinks. CAMRA is only aware of four other sets of spirit cocks at Shipman's, Northampton;  Queens Head ('Turners Vault'), Stockport, Greater Manchester; Haunch of Venison, Salisbury, Wiltshire; and Bull, Paisley, Scotland  - all CAMRA Heritage Pubs.\r\n\r\nBetween the counter and the snugs is a wide expanse of black and white tiling, On the front internal wall is a dado of colourful Craven Dunnill tiles. The ceiling is held up by five wooden columns with decorative Corinthian capitals \u2013 all along the exterior walls are more decorative capitals at the top of square pilasters faced with relief plasterwork. The exterior colourful painted windows have a central feature of a crown in a garland. The bar is lit by 27 gas lights: these are modern replacements but add greatly to the atmosphere. Even the gents' retains its original tiled floor and what looks like inter-war tiled walls to two-thirds height. The door has two colourful painted panels topped by the words \u2018Lavatory\u2019. Accessed by a door near the toilets or from its own exterior door on Amelia Street upstairs is the Crown Dining Rooms added in 1988. It has two Victorian style fireplaces, modern bar counter and bar back fitting. \r\n\r\nIn 2007 the National Trust carried out a \u00a3500,000 refurbishment when the blackened ceiling (due to smoking) was thoroughly cleaned: it is now more of a red-brown colour with two small illuminated sections above the bar-back fitting returned to the original burnished primrose yellow, gold and red plasterwork. Damaged tiling on the bar front was repaired, the bar-back glass and bell-box indicator cleaned, and attempts were made to remove some of the graffiti in the snugs. The Crown has featured as a location in numerous film and television productions, such as David Caffrey\u2019s Divorcing Jack (1998) and as far back as 1947 (a facsimile) in Carol Reed's 1947 film Odd Man Out which starred James Mason.",

        "Address": "25-27 Springfield Road, Belfast, BT12 7AB",
        "Description": "UPDATE 2022.  A report has advised of a refurbishment recently been carried out which requires a re-assessment. Further details welcome.  Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. Recent photos would also be welcome. \r\n\r\nThe second finest historic pub interior in Belfast to the Crown for the quality and exuberance of its late Victorian interior. It dates from 1885 and was run by the McGuigan family for 77 years - note the 'C & P McGuigan' mosaic in the doorway. It has the layout that is special to Northern Ireland \u2013 a row of tiny snugs along the exterior wall and a wide black and white diamond shaped tiled drinking space between them and the bar counter. \r\n\r\nThe other best remaining examples of snugs in Northern Ireland are at the Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Rock, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Ronnie Drew's, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Mandeville Arms, Portadown; Blakes of the Hollow, Enniskillen and the rare survivor Carraghers, Camlough, Co. Armagh being a small village pub. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Fort Bar has on the rear left what looks like a snug but in the past it would have sold groceries - note the 'Grocery Department' in the  etched glass window on the door from the vestibule entrance on the Cooligan Street side. Also, you will see the height of the counter here is lower than that of the main bar. The traditional Irish combination of a shop and drinking place was made illegal in 1923, following the partition of Ireland, and this area was closed and used by staff until the 1970s when it returned to use as a snug. It has a red and black quarry tiled floor and bare benches on two sides. \r\n\r\nThe seven-bay richly carved mahogany bar-back is a spectacularly ornate piece topped by a balustrade and a clock. There was a minor change in the 1970s to add barrel ends all the way all the bar back fitting (it was plain wood before) and across each cask end a piece of wood has been added so optics can be screwed to it. The bar counter has carved brackets all along it and along the top on the left hand side is a series of tiled paintings of lakeland scenes. There are less ornate tiles on the right hand side of the bar counter which curves inwards. \r\n\r\nWithin the drinking space on the right is a cast iron pillar with decorative capital and attached to it and the counter is a short carved mahogany screen with mirrored panels on both sides. On the left side of the counter is another small screen featuring a 'JJ & S Strongest 24% under proof John Jameson Whisky' mirror which is attached to another cast iron pillar with decorative capital situated within the servery. Good plaster segmented ceiling. \r\n\r\nThere is a row of five snugs facing the servery split by the main front entrance lobby and all retain their original doors but they have been permanently fixed in an open position since the days of 'The Troubles'. Originally there were eight - seven across the front of the room and another one on the rear right - look for the pattern of the black and white tiled floor indicating where the partition that created it was situated. A fireplace in this area has also been removed.. \r\n\r\nThe snugs are formed of solid partitions with glazed panels at the top, bare benches attached to them and have red and black quarry tiled floors. Each snug has a number painted on a small glass pane in the door. The existing snugs have the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6. Snugs 7 and 8 were situated on the front left of the pub and were lost when the the toilets were brought inside in the 1970s. Note the doors from snugs numbers 7 and 8 have been retained and situated on the left hand side of the servery. \r\n\r\nThe upstairs lounge did have some Art Deco fittings but it was refurbished in c.2004 and now has no old fittings. \r\n\r\nTo reach this pub why not try the famous Falls taxi-bus service which leaves from Castle Street. London-style Hackney cabs arrived in West Belfast at the height of the Troubles and provided an invaluable hop-on, hop-off service when regular schedules were severely disrupted. Though the Troubles are a thing of the past, the black taxis remain and are very much a part of the local community. Each cab takes up to 6 people and customers jump in and out as they travel along the Falls Road. Just flag one down anywhere along the road and tap the window behind the driver when you want to stop.",

        "Pub Name": "Boyd Arms",
        "Address": "4 The Diamond, Ballycastle, BT54 6AW",
        "Description": "A three-storey former hotel of probable mid 18th-century construction (a painted sign on the gable has a date of 1761). In the public bar and snug are some Victorian or early 20th-century fittings. It is named after the Boyd family on whose land Ballycastle lies and who built the pub and other buildings in this part of town. They built the Boyds Arms Hotel for the holsters, coach-drivers, attendants and similar lower classes and for the gentry the Antrim Arms Hotel across the street. \r\n\r\nThe right-hand front door leads into a corridor with a red and yellow diamond-shaped quarry-tiled floor, old dado panelling painted cream, a couple of basic benches and narrow shelves for stand-up drinking. Don\u2019t miss the indicator box in the corridor showing where service was required, including the five letting bedrooms. \r\n\r\nThe left-hand front door leads to a typical, simple Irish bar stretching back from the street. The old bar back consists of shelves with a mirrored back. The bar counter appears to be a replacement from the 1950s with its plain wood frontage and Formica top. The narrow room has more old dado panelling and some bench seating. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the counter there is a tiny snug created by partition walls that reach the ceiling, the one attached to the servery being fully glazed above the dado. It has a latch and plank door, two benches attached to the partition walls, a small table attached to the wall and a little hatch through which drinks can be served. The snug was popular on cattle fair days for private deals. \r\n\r\nAcross the corridor is another room but here the fittings including the Victorian-style fireplace are modern. The small room at the rear with a figure 2 over the doorway was refitted in 1998. \r\n\r\nThe pub and the town are incredibly busy on the days of Ould Lammas Fair, which dates from 1606 and is therefore one of Ireland\u2019s oldest fairs. It falls on the last Tuesday of August but starts on a Sunday evening and runs all day Monday and Tuesday. It is now most famous for it's 'Dulse' - edible seaweed that has been collected from local shores and dried out and 'Yellow Man' - a yellow candy similar in texture to toffee and taste of honeycomb.",

        "Pub Name": "House of McDonnell",
        "Address": "71 Castle Street, Ballycastle, BT54 6AS",
        "Description": "Built in 1744, this is a great classic among Irish pubs which has been in the same family ownership since 1766. It shows a typical arrangement for a spirit-grocers where you could combine a shopping trip with one to the pub until such dual-purpose establishments were banned by law in 1922. The interior was refitted in around 1885 and the only change since then was the adding of a pitch pine bar counter that runs the length of the room and the oak and frosted glass partition half-way down the room which are believed to have been added in 1921. Normally, there is a notable difference in the height of the counters in the grocery shop part of a spirit grocers and those in the bar part, the latter being much higher but here they are at the same height. Shortly after the Partition of Ireland in 1922 there was a change in Northern Ireland licensing law and \u2018mixed trading\u2019 was outlawed so it became illegal for pubs to also have grocery, hardware or any other non-alcohol trading counter on their premises. There are still a number of these spirit-grocers left in the Republic of Ireland but the opening of hundreds of Tesco, Aldi and Lidl supermarkets means there are few active grocery parts remaining there nowadays. \r\n\r\nThe wording on the front of the pub was \u2018The Store\u2019 and it was only changed to \u2018The House of McDonnell\u2019 when present owner Tom O\u2019Neil inherited it in 1969 from his aunt Mary McDonnell, whose family have now run the pub for fourteen generations. The porch has a Victorian colourful tiled floor and through the twin doors is the public bar where the grocery and drinking areas are separated by the screen halfway down the bar. \r\n\r\nThe front former grocery part of the bar has a black and white diamond quarry tiled floor, panelled bar counter, and on the panelled walls there are two large mirrors - an \u2018Old Bushmills Pure Malt Whisky\u2019 and a \u2018James McAllister & Son\u2019s Fine Old Irish Whisky\u2019 one. Drinkers on the bar stools are able to rest their feet on a brass rail salvaged from HMS Drake, a British war cruiser torpedoed off Rathlin Island in 1917. Alternative seating consists of Bentwood chairs and some African hardwood three-legged stools scattered around. On the left is a tiny dimly lit snug with a Victorian window of red and blue panes. \r\n\r\nBeyond the partition dividing the grocery and the bar is a room of similar size with a brown and cream quarry tiled floor, and another similar panelled counter. The impressive bar back fitting features two pairs of end-on spirit casks that dispensed spirits in olden days and a pair of gold and silver embossed \u2018Wilson\u2019s Old Irish Whisky Belfast\u2019 mirrors. On the rear wall within the servery is a fine large mirror advertising \u201910 Years Old H C Coleraine Pure Malt Whisky Robt. A Taylor Ltd. Distillers\u2019 mirror. HC? It stands for House of Commons as Irish MPs are said to have been very partial to this brand. (Note that the \u2018e\u2019 in Whiskey to denote the Irish variety only became standard during the 20th century). \r\n\r\nAt the rear through a sliding door is a small room with a brown and cream quarry tiled floor, a late 1930s tiled fireplace and two sections of modern fixed seating. On the walls are a small \u2018Cantrell & Cochranes Ginger Ale\u2019 mirror, a framed advertisements for D\u2019Arcy\u2019s Extra Dublin Stout\u2019 and prints of the St Albans Grand Steeple Chase of 1832. The \u2018outside\u2019 gents and the ladies and now accessed along a covered walkway \u2013 the gents retains its terrazzo floor and dado. Upstairs is a lounge which is only used at busy times such as the Ould Lammas Fair \u2013 see Boyds Arms for more details.",

Front right-hand door leads into a porch with yellow and red diamond quarry-tiled floor. The excellent small public bar has a terrazzo floor, a panelled bar counter that could date from the 1930s with a terrazzo trough along the base of it. The bar back consists of four advertising mirrors with optics attached to timber partially covering some mirrors. The mirrors advertise 'Brown Corbet & Co's Old Irish Whisky Belfast'; 'Dunville's Whisky'; 'Greer's OVH Old Vatted Highland Whiskey 10 Years Old'; and 'Dunville's Whisky'. The room has inter-war fielded panelled walls and a bell box is situated high up near the door. \r\n\r\nA door with \u2018Lounge\u2019 painted on a 1930s ribbed glass panel leads to the small smoke room with more fielded panelling to two-thirds height and a terrazzo floor.

The bell-push here was still in use until 2005 and there are remains of the cantilever fitting above the door which rang a bell when the door was opened; the fixed seating is modern. \r\n\r\nOn the rear left the old kitchen, complete with white glazed brick, a still working 'Fairy Esse' cooker and black and red quarry tiled floor, was pressed into public use as the bell-pushes indicate. In recent years the wall that separated the former kitchen from the small front room, with its wooden floor and tiled fireplace, was removed. In the corridor that runs from the front left door, which has a diamond quarry tiled floor and inter-war fielded panelling, you will notice the door to the ladies\u2019 toilet retains its penny-in-the-slot-device, which was still in use until the late 1990s! The outbuildings still retain some of the equipment for bottling Guinness but the rare traditional game of horseshoes, in which the aim is to land them on a pin, is no longer played in the yard at the insistence of the local Health & Safety Officer!",

        "Pub Name": "Carraghers Bar",
        "Address": "12 Main Street, Camlough, BT35 7JG",
        "Description": "A plain red frontage conceals one of the most important and complete pub interiors anywhere in the British Isles and almost entirely unchanged for over a century. Don\u2019t be put off by the restrictive hours and the need to knock on the door to enter the pub as this is a \u2018must-visit\u2019 for lovers of historic pubs interiors. It was built in 1862 and is situated at the end of mixed terracing. The fittings date from the late Victorian or possibly even the Edwardian era so the pub will have been refitted a few years after the present family took ownership in 1888. The only real change in a century has been the laying of attractive new terrazzo flooring, probably, in the 1920s which extends along the passage to the side door. \r\n\r\nMuch of the main bar is taken up with three intact snugs, which are such a speciality of Northern Irish bars. The snug on the front left has the figure \u20182\u2019 on the door, a red and black quarry tiled floor, fixed seating (re-upholstered in the 1980s) attached to the front and partition wall. Along the top of the snug is a row of Art Nouveau stained and leaded panels and there are more panels of stained glass in the door. The second snug with the figure \u20183\u2019 on the door is as the first one but with U-shaped fixed seating. A similarly fitted third snug with the figure \u20184\u2019 on the door is situated in the rear left corner of the room. Between the second and third snugs is the passage from the side entrance door. \r\n\r\nWhilst we are aware snugs were originally installed in a number of small Northern Irish bars most have been removed in modern times with the aim of increasing the floor area for drinkers. Rows of snugs do survive in larger pubs such as the Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland;Rock, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Ronnie Drew's, Belfast, Northern Ireland; \r\n Mandeville Arms, Portadown; Fort Bar, West Belfast; and Blakes of the Hollow, Enniskillen. This makes the survival of the interior of Carraghers more remarkable and this was recognised by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency when they agreed to statutory list Carragher\u2019s Bar at the instigation of CAMRA\u2019s Pub Heritage Group. \r\n\r\nThe bar-back fitting is a seven-bay affair with mirrored pilasters dividing up the sections and four spirit casks (two for rum and two for whiskey). On the return is a fine mirror advertising Kirker, Greer\u2019s \u2018Cream of Old Irish Whisky\u2019. Note how the top section of the bar back continues across the rear wall and over the snug and like the rest of the fitting it is filled with spirit bottles. In the bar back is a simple drawer for a till \u2013 look for the copper heater for making hot whisky, which is still in use today. The original bar-counter has a row of coloured tiles set in near the top in typical Northern Irish style and a spittoon trough in front of the counter now used for collecting cigarette ends and sundry detritus. Unusually situated on a lower level and not on the bar top is a set of handpumps with porcelain handles from the days when Guinness and Irish beer was sold in casks which continued until the early 1960s. \r\n\r\nOn the front right is a door with the figure \u20181\u2019 on it which leads to a small room which can still be used by customers and has a real fire but it doubles as the licensees office. The brick fireplace and upholstered fixed seating are modern. A door at the rear of the public bar leads into a small room also with a terrazzo floor and beyond this is the Snooker Room with a lino floor. It contains a full sized snooker table bought in the 1980s for \u00a32,500 and available for customers' use; the fixed seating in this room was added at the same time. \r\n\r\nLike other pubs in Ireland, Guinness was bottled here and they still have the bottle washer, crown corker and old bottle labels. This unspoilt gem of a pub has none of the modern items seen in pubs nowadays \u2013 there is no TV, no piped music, no fruit machines, no pool table and no food \u2013 not even crisps or nuts!",

The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place.\n\nThis is a very rare, intact example of the way they built pubs in the 1960s and, as such, it shows the last phase of the traditional pub planning and fitting. The left-hand door leads to the public bar and right one to a lounge but there is no connection between the two rooms. The former was clearly a gents' space and the latter a mixed one as the availability of the toilets clearly shows! Two tiny snugs either side of the bar entrance. The bar is plainly furnished, the lounge rather more luxurious (e.g. a padded bar counter rather than a cheap laminate one): no doubt there was a copper or two on the price of drinks to reflect the difference.",

        "Pub Name": "Mandeville Arms",
        "Address": "1-3 Mandeville Street, Portadown, BT62 3PB",
        "Description": "Built as the Mandeville Arms Hotel and named after the Duke of Mandeville it is known locally as \u2018McConvilles\u2019 after the family that owned the pub from 1865 up to 2005 and has a \u2018McConville Bros Wine Merchants\u2019 fascia. It was rebuilt in the late 1890s and is one of the great pub interiors of Northern Ireland or, indeed, anywhere featuring ten intact snugs. The front door (not currently in use) has a fine vestibule entrance with a balustrade, carved urns on the corners and lots of stained glass windows. Off this is what is often called \u2018a ladies snug\u2019 in which they could drink without being seen in the rest of the pub. It has a colourful Victorian tiled floor, dado panelling with a bell push, a leatherette bench and a door to the side of the servery. \r\n\r\nThe long public bar has a colourful Victorian tiled floor and is split in two by a low partition with double doors. The decorated and mirrored seven-bay carved mahogany bar-back incorporates four casks that would have sold spirits in the past. McConvilles bottled several drinks in the early 20th century including a popular \u2018McConville\u2019s Navy Rum\u2019, Kopke\u2019s Invalid Port, a strong Australian wine and their own McConville\u2019s whiskey, which is was still possible to drink here up to 2005. The splendid original bar counter has a typically Northern Irish fringe of colourful hand painted tiles at the top, also a row of small brown tiles along the base and just above it a row of different colourful tiles. Halfway along Mandeville Street is another disused entrance with a fine vestibule entrance with a balustrade, carved urns on the corners and lots of stained glass windows. \r\n\r\nThe most distinctive, and, again, almost uniquely Northern Irish feature, is the seven snugs ranged parallel to the counter split three from the front door to the side door and another four between the middle door and the main entrance. Also, there are two more affixed to the counter at the far end of the servery making a total of ten snugs altogether. These two snugs have small windows in the part glazed partition on the end of the counter. Each snug has colourful Victorian tiled floor, dado panelling on the street side and bench seating is attached to two sides of each snug. The original and still working central heating pipes run through the snugs. Note the bell-pushes to order drinks and the tiny fixed tables on which to place them. All the snugs retain their doors with glazed panels on the front end. The bell-box where staff could see where service was needed is situated high up at the south end of the room and some of the bells still work. \r\n\r\nThe other best remaining examples of snugs in Northern Ireland being at the Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Rock, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Ronnie Drew's, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Fort Bar, West Belfast; Blakes of the Hollow, Enniskillen and the rare survivor Carragher's, Camlough, Co. Armagh being a small village pub. \r\n\r\nThe main entrance is further down Mandeville Street and has an iron canopy from which hangs an old mighty rococo lantern - one of the best anywhere. Inside is a porch formed by partition walls reaching up to the high heavily moulded ceiling. The colourful Victorian tiled floor at this end of the room is particularly well worn and cracked from having barrels of stout rolled across it over many years. It even retains original gas light fittings which can run on bottled gas. The amazingly old fashioned gents\u2019 remain with its black and white marble floor, dado of white tiles and probably the best traditional WC in Northern Ireland with its wooden seat! Don't miss the cigar lighter representing the Tichborne Claimant, an imposer whose attempts to prove he was the vanished Sir Roger Tichborne, the ninth wealthiest man in Britain, captivated public attention during two high-profile court cases in the 1870s. Sadly it has recently been disconnected from its gas supply.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 a second bar was added without any impact on the original pub. Bar 2 is accessed via its own front door on the left of the building or via a door from the rear of the original bar. The only change was the removal of the original ladies' toilet, which was situated in the left-hand part of the building, presumably as a late add-on to the pub.",

        "Pub Name": "Blakes Of The Hollow",
        "Address": "6 Church Street, Enniskillen, BT74 7EJ",
        "Description": "Described by Irish writer Colm Toibin as a \u2018cathedral of a pub\u2019, this is a great classic among Ireland\u2019s historic pubs. It is known as \u2018Blakes of the Hollow\u2019 as it is situated in a dip in the centre of Enniskillen and to distinguish it from another Blakes Bar in the town. It was last refurbished in 1887 by Richard Herbert and retains its Victorian layout and fine collection of fittings. It was run by the Blake family that gave the pub its name from 1929 to 1996 and then it was purchased by another Blake \u2013 Pat Blake from Derrylin. It has a distinctive deep red painted exterior and fascia of \u2018William Blake\u2019 that has featured hundreds of picture postcards and guides. Legend says the red and black colour stripes were designed in olden times to help people who couldn\u2019t read to identify it as a pub in the same way as red and white used to be the colour for a barber\u2019s shop. \r\n\r\nBeyond the central front door is an inner porch with a tiled floor where the left hand door leads into a tiny snug which was no doubt used by ladies and other passers-by who wanted a drink without attracting general attention to the fact by customers in the public bar. Note the little holes above the hatch that held the cord for a green baize curtain, which was slid across the hatch. This tiny room has a bare wood floor, a door in the partition around the end of the servery and its own piece of counter with a white marble top, also an old pew. Double doors on the right of the inner porch lead into the high ceilinged public bar with a colourful Victorian tiled floor. \r\n\r\nThe front bar, stretching back from the street, is full of character with the walls and ceiling being entirely wood-panelled. The over 100 year old panelled counter has a white marble top and two tall brass gas lamps that have been converted to electric \u2013 probably the only concession to modernity here! The late Victorian bar back fitting features four large casks which originally dispensed spirits. Look for the box high up on the right-hand wall which showed where service was required by seated drinkers in the more private parts of the pub \u2013 the bells were disconnected in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nAt the far end of the servery is another snug with a door, a venerable cast-iron fireplace, bare wood floor and a collection of waiters trays including old whisky ones on the full height panelling. Further back still (and up a flight of seven steps) is a passage with a series of three partitioned snugs, also some tables, a pew and the odd bell push. The first snug is the publican's office, still complete with the sloping desk from which he could keep an eye on proceedings. It retains its door and has pew seating. Behind this is another larger snug with a bare wood floor, a bell push above the dado panelling, pew seating and a few small \u2018Bass\u2019 mirrors on the wall. At the rear is a rather larger room with door, bare wood floor, a Victorian cast iron fireplace, a bell push, pews and here modern items such as a pool table and fruit machine. \r\n\r\nThe other best remaining examples of snugs in Northern Ireland are at the Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Rock, Belfast, Northern Ireland; \r\nRonnie Drew's, Belfast, Northern Ireland; \r\nMandeville Arms, Portadown; \r\nFort Bar, West Belfast; \r\nand the rare survivor \r\nCarraghers, Camlough, Co. Armagh \r\nbeing a small village pub. \r\n\r\nBeyond the right hand door lies a passage with a terrazzo floor that leads to a massive 6 floor extension added at the rear in 2001/2 in the area which originally housed stores etc. where they bottled Guinness as well as their own gin and sherry and Powers and Jameson whiskies in the past. Also in this area there was a most unusual item for a pub - a bath! It had a huge copper shower head on it and a big furnace provided the hot water. The rear modern additions include a dining room called Caf\u00e9 Merlot, a restaurant called Number 6 (both now run as a separate business) with their own bars, also other bars with a Gothic theme and a night club called Level 7. \r\n\r\nSome details from the Belfast Telegraph",

It was refitted in 1895 and has been in the Reihill family since 1924. The front right hand door has a vestibule entrance and a door in the part glazed partition on the right side leads to a superb tiny snug for discreet drinking which also doubles as the off sales.

The bar has both tongue-and-groove panelled walls and panelled ceiling. It has an impressive 25ft-long continuous counter. The splendid bar-back fitting has four mighty spirit barrels, which is thought to have last dispensed spirits in 1953. \r\n\r\nOn the left-hand wall is a bell and annunciator box for the staff in times gone by to see where table service was required in the other rooms \u2013 it has \u2018Sitting Room\u2019, \u2018Bar Parlour\u2019 and \u2018Back Room\u2019 windows. The bar has a modern tiled floor. The front left door leads to a sparse room with a wood-block floor, panelled dado and has a bell-push. Behind the main bar is a smaller  room (no doubt the 'Back Room' on the annunciator box) which is also fully panelled. Further back still there are a couple of rooms that have been brought into use in recent years, one of which was formerly the kitchen.",

        "Description": "A real gem of a bar, lovingly cared for by its owner, Garry Owens, whose family has held it since 1960. It opened in 1852 and was refitted in 1929 though the fittings could easily be taken to be Victorian. There has been no significant change since. A large square servery takes up almost as much space as that for the customers but this is made up for by three further cosy rooms. A panelled corridor runs towards the rear and there are panelled ceilings in all except the rear left-hand room. Two old etched front windows. The care shown for the building is the way the illuminated fridges are tucked under the counter (not exposed to customers\u2019 view as so often is, unfortunately, the case), and the fact that Garry has refused to encumber the counter with large, ugly modern advertising founts. \r\n\r\nThe public bar on the front right has the bar back fitting from 1929, which faces two ways at right angles with on the far left and far right casks that in the past held whiskey or other spirits. The two-sided bar counter is also the inter-war one. This small room has fully panelled walls and there is only space for a row of bar stools between the bar front and the front window with it's 'Spirits' decorative etched and frosted panel. \r\n\r\nA door opposite the servery leads to a small room on the front left with bare wood floor, old dado panelling, an early 20th century glazed brick, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace and a bell push on the mantelpiece from the days of table service. The rear left room has two doors and prior to 1929 his might have been a kitchen and another room. It has a tiled floor, a cast iron and wood surround fireplace with display cabinets in the wall either side of the fireplace, old dado panelling and a good 'Wilson's Old Irish Whisky Belfast' mirror. \r\n\r\nThere is another very small room at the rear right with a door, bare wood floor, old dado panelling another early 20th century glazed brick, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace, a bell push on the mantelshelf from the days of table service and just one scrubbed top table. The rear right passage and gents\u2019 have terrazzo floors from 1929. \r\n\r\nLook for the flag from the 18th green of the 2011 Open Championships at Royal St Georges autographed by the winner Darren Clarke, who occasionally drinks here and on one occasion brought the famous \u2018Claret Jug\u2019 with him! A marquee erected in the garden is the main venue of Limavady\u2019s Jazz and Blues Festival held over 4 days in June annually. Closed all day Sunday.",

Erected in 1876 with a distinctive, gabled frontage, the building became a pub in 1905. The former public meeting room, defined by an area with a cornice containing Scottish thistles, was expanded to the right by the absorption of a passage. The public bar has four large advertising mirrors; two for Dryborough's and one each for Jeffrey's IPA and Bertram's Scotch Whisky. The wall-panelling was replaced c.1985.

It would have presented much the same plain appearance as it does today, as the only sign that this a pub at all are words above the door, 'J Dobie Licensee'. The Dobie family - present owner and publican, Ronnie - is said to be the longest-serving family licensees in Fife. Inside is one of the smallest public bars in Scotland, and two other rooms, just one of which is in regular use. Enter down a passage with its partitioned wall, hatch, shelf for passageway drinking and working bell-box. \r\n\r\nThe door on the left leads to the tiny public bar, where there is a bar counter at least 60 years old with a Bakelite top.

Seating consists of just four double seats originally constructed by Alexander's bus builders of Falkirk; there is just one oblong table with well-worn Formica top and cast-iron base. \r\n\r\nThe front right small room with '2' on the door has a decorative pink cast fireplace from the 1930s, half-height panelling, a five-legged table and you can press the bell for table service. The rear left room with '3' on the door contains an antique decoratively carved table and another working bell-push. The fourth small room at the rear with '1' on the door is now used as a storeroom.",

        "Description": "A splendid example of Edwardian pub fitting and especially notable for the display of ceramics, one of the best in Scotland, including an 18 metre (59 feet) long bar counter completely fronted with brown Art Nouveau-style tiles. The pub was rebuilt in 1890 and then remodelled in 1902 by William Williamson with two-tone tiled walls, including two small Doulton\u2019s of Lambeth tiled panels (each a large  single tile) featuring a jester evidently eyeing up the shepherdess a few feet away. The figure is the same as Touchstone at the St James Tavern, Soho, London W1. \r\n\r\nThe large bar area has an all-over mosaic floor, a mahogany gantry and a long-case clock and within the servery is a semi-octagonal Publican's Office. \r\n\r\nOther original features include stained glass windows with the arms of Scotland, England and Ireland, lots of etched glass and two mosaic porch floors, one now opened up. There is a former restaurant at the rear left with a hatch but this area has undergone modern changes. Visit the intact gents' if you can for its glass-panelled Doulton's cistern, a pair of marble-framed urinals, tiled walls and a mosaic floor. The central entrance on Bogie's Wynd must have led originally to a small off-sales compartment divided from the bars on either side by screens.",

It has two bars, each side of an off-sales compartment and a snug. Although not visually exciting, the intactness of this pub is very special. The all-over panelled bar on the far left has a ribbed wood counter, an inter-war fireplace, and 1960s fitted seating. Note the old 'Bar' and 'Tennants' cemented-on lettering on the glass.\n\r\nThe tiny off-sales facing the entrance has surrounding partitions and a small hatch to the servery. The snug to its right is similar in style but twice the size and open to the counter and has a mirror declaring 'Old Scotch Whisky' on a timber upright on the counter. The bar on the far right is very similar to the other one, and like the rest of the pub, has all-over timber panelling on its walls. Note the old mechanism behind the counter part for an electric air compressor used to dispense the beer in former days: the associated pressure dials were sadly dismounted from the walls (but as at November 2012 were stored at the back of the servery). There are only basic shelves making up the back gantry, which are of no great age.\n\r\nThere is a large mirror declaring 'Auld House Luncheon Bar Fine Old Cameron Bridge Whisky' mirror in the passage to the toilets on the left-hand side. This leads to a lounge at the back called the 'Silver Pheasant', after the eponymous pheasant beside the servery: the room was created by the grandmother of the present owner in the 1960s and is a real period piece.",

It retained the name of The Grill when remodelled by architects Jenkins & Marr, and turned into a pub in 1926. The mainly stand-up bar retains its fittings of that date, including a fine mahogany gantry with three glazed cabinets.  The pub has two ceiling sections with moulded plasterwork - the front, oval in shape; the rear, circular. The long bar counter has a number of badged sections on the front each with a letter 'G' and a brass match-striker all along it. The walls are covered in mahogany veneer and the tables with cast-iron bases are inscribed 'The Grill'. \r\n\r\nAs this was a strictly men-only bar until the Sex Discrimination Act came into force on 1 January 1976, there was no ladies' toilet until 1998 when new gents' facilities were added downstairs and the former gents' WC revamped into the ladies'. (The nearby Bridge Bar, another 'men-only' bar, still has no ladies' toilet and there is a sign on the door to warn customers of this fact!). The Grill carries over 300 single malt Scottish whiskies on sale - ask for the informative menu.",

The panelled rear snug has old mirrors and basic bench seating. \r\n\r\nSadly, the front snug with its 1920s tiled and wood surround fireplace was opened-up by the removal of the wall in Feb 2006 following a customer consultation which resulted in a 58% vote in favour of the alteration. There are a number of old brewery, whisky and soft drinks mirrors. The premises to the left of the pub were purchased in the early 1990s and contain a new lounge bar, dining room and function room.",

It has the second longest continuous bar counter in the UK measuring 31.8 m on the outer circumference, as opposed to the 32.6 m at the Falcon, Battersea, London SW11. Built in 1870 and remodelled in 1885-7 by John Scouller and again in 1901, when the partitions between sitting rooms and the bar were removed. The elongated horseshoe-shaped bar counter was also extended at the rear. The initials JYW in small, etched glazed screens on the counter refer to John Young Whyte who succeeded Scouller in 1923. The island gantry includes eight end-on casks with, unusually, two taps in each (cf the Central Bar, Renton): until the 1930s, they were used to dispense spirits, including the house specialty 'Lachie', a ten-year-old blend of Highland malt whiskies. \r\n\r\nOn the side walls there are two horseshoe-shaped fireplaces: the similar features on the back wall  are ornamental rather than fireplaces. At the front is  a clock with the letters 'The Horseshoe' instead of numbers. The wooden-panelled walls with decorative strap-work at the top have large bell-pushes, mostly in decorative panels around the room. At the front are two good stained glass windows screens and two large mirrors, one with 'JYW' and the other advertising 'Lachie' whisky. The upstairs lounge with modern fittings is a popular venue for karaoke from 8pm each evening and 4pm on Sundays.",

One hundred years ago, there were many ornate pubs like this throughout the city, as publicans went to great lengths to outshine their competitors at a time when skilled labour was cheap. This is one of the last remaining Victorian  'palace pubs' in Glasgow; sadly, similar interiors have been ripped out in recent times only to be replaced by poorer quality modern fittings. The large bar has a magnificent dark wooden back gantry incorporating two sets of four whisky casks either side of a mirrored centrepiece, a pediment and central clock. There was a tier of smaller barrels in the recess below the large barrels but they were removed some time ago. The original long bar counter with some part glazed short partitions has a new polished stone top. \r\n\r\nOn the dark wood panelled walls are four superb huge advertising mirrors painted and gilded by Forest & Son of Glasgow, one of the largest suppliers of decorated mirrors in the UK in the 1890s. On the right-hand wall of the bar are ones for 'Robert Younger's of Edinburgh 90/- Ales'; 'Black & Gold the Aristocrat of Whiskies' and another for Wm McEwan. On the rear left wall is one for 'Very Old Vintage Port & Brandy, Champagne, Clarets'. Note the colourful painted windows on the two sets of inner doors and in the vestibule entrance on Admiral Street, where a jug and bottle was originally situated. Other original features include a panelled ceiling, carved woodwork, mahogany panels above the seating; there are only modern fittings in the downstairs lounge bar.",

It is one of three impressive 1930s Art Deco survivors in Glasgow - the others being the Portland Arms, also in this guide, and Rogano's an upmarket seafood restaurant and bar. Situated in the ground floor of a late 18th-century four-storey building, the bar has been owned by the same family for 40 years; its name comes from the two steps into the pub. Has an Art Deco frontage of Vitrolite panelling and frosted glass window, one of which was replaced in 2006. \r\n\r\nThe interior is complete with sleek veneer-panelled walls, the original back gantry of Australian walnut, and the original bar counter. The hooped stall on the counter indicates an area for use only by bar staff offering waiter service to the customers in the splendid sitting room at the rear left. This small room has more sleek veneer panelled walls, original fixed seating and a stained glass window depicting the Cunard liner the R.M.S. Queen Mary, built at Clydebank and launched in 1936: an aeroplane flies above. The bell-pushes worked until recently and table service was provided (a shame this rare institution has been discontinued). The only major physical changes have been the replacement of floor coverings, the new gents' toilets at the rear and the adding of a ladies' for the first time in the 1950s (the toilets have Formica panelling on the walls as at the Laurieston Bar on Bridge Street).\r\n\r\nOther  surviving Art Deco interiors can be found at these Heritage Pubs Three Pigeons, Halifax, West Yorkshire; Vale Hotel, Arnold, Nottinghamshire; Test Match, West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire; Duke (of York), Bloomsbury, London WC1; Portland Arms, Glasgow; and Frews Bar, Dundee; in the Sporting Memories Lounge.",

It is a popular drinkers' pub which gets packed when Celtic are playing. A single-storey brick building with polished stone frontage is still owned by the same family since it was rebuilt in 1938 by Thomas Sandilands & Macleod. This remarkable survivor has a splendid oval bar counter with a zebra-like veneer panelling and match-strikers all around the metal rim. The original island gantry has a lighting canopy above it.

It little-altered state is due to being owned by former licensee Margaret Hodge's family for 60 years until 2000. \r\n\r\nThe counter now painted brown has ribbed panels and pilasters apart from the front section, which may indicate the loss of a jug and bottle. The entrance lobby has doors on the left and right with a wall between them that has a modern window at the top so it is not clear how it would have worked if there originally was a jug bar. \r\n\r\nThe modest free-standing island gantry consists of two tall upright bays with a walkway for staff through the middle and is mainly original - certainly the uprights are old and probably the top canopy as well but the shelves look to be made of much newer wood i.e. replacements of original shelves. Look for the old till drawer that was in use up to 2000. Sensibly, fridges have been placed under the bar counter leaving the gantry intact. \r\n\r\nThe walls are panelled to picture rail height all around the room painted cream and there are decorative cornices and ceiling roses painted brown. There are original fixed slatted wooden benches (now with cushions) lining the left and right window alcoves (there is no sign of any partitions that could have created snugs at the front left or right) and down part of the left side - all are painted brown. There is a 1920s fireplace on the left with an old wood surround but modern tiled interior. Original fixed L-plan timber tables on cast-iron supports also survive. \r\n\r\nIn both front windows are narrow 'Murray's Famous Ales' window screens and on the wall is an old 'Wm Murray & Co's India Pale Ale' mirror; sadly, a Murray's mirror in a three part frame with Sir Walter Scott's print on the left and a Robert Burn's print on the right is no longer on the wall of the bar. The partitioned area in the far right corner is a spirits cupboard, and has a '5' on the door. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 the rear part of the pub was altered and former toilets, a tiny snug used for storage and a passageway on the left to the toilets, which also acted as a snug, was replaced by new toilets on the right, a new pool room on the left which has an old 'Wm Murray & Co's India Pale Ale' mirror,  and the doorway to the former toilets is now a cupboard.",

It retains a spirit cask gantry and five (until recently six) sets of four spirit cocks (the only ones we are aware of in Scotland), which were used originally to dispense the whisky and other spirits from the casks. CAMRA is only aware of four other sets of spirit cocks at Shipman's, Northampton; Queens Head 'Turners Vault', Stockport, Greater Manchester; Haunch of Venison, Salisbury, Wiltshire; and Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland - all CAMRA Heritage Pubs. \r\n\r\nThis four-storey red sandstone ashlar tenement building, complete with a conical-roofed turret, was built in 1901 by W D McLennan. Beyond the stained glass front windows is a dark, panelled public bar with an impressive back gantry running down the right hand side and containing four, large, elongated, upright whisky barrels and four smaller spirit casks. Over the long bar counter are six arched service areas - an unusual device. On the left-hand side is a splendid terrazzo-tiled and wood-surround fireplace with a mirrored overmantlel, and two old fixed seating areas with timber and leaded glass short partitions. \r\n\r\nMoving on to the back of the pub, you will find a timber and leaded glass partition; beyond it there are three snugs, one of which still retains its door. The book 'People's Palaces' has a plan showing there were four snugs originally - two on the left and two at the rear. New toilets have replaced the rear snugs, which explains why the ladies' has a \u20183\u2019 on the door and the gents', a '4'. The snug on the right was originally a private room.

The dark, dado-panelled walls have inlaid mirrors; there are mahogany fittings including pediments above the doors, and a very decorative high ceiling in green and cream painted plaster. There was a small lounge at the rear of the bar but this was lost when the first floor was acquired for pub use in the early 1970s and a staircase built in its place. The upstairs restaurant has quality fittings including a small circular bar counter and panelled walls with inset mirrors but all date from the 1970s.  The Abbotsford is one of only a handful of pubs in Edinburgh still using the traditional Scottish method of dispense - the tall fount (the 'u' is silent) - to dispense its range of real ales.",

        "Address": "8 Leven Street, Edinburgh, EH3 9LG",
        "Description": "Edinburgh's second finest interior after the Caf\u00e9 Royal and little changed since 1906. It is the last pub in the city with an original gantry featuring four spirit casks, and has an extraordinary tiled and mirrored interior, as well as a rare jug bar. It also stocks 120 single malt whiskies. The ornate gantry has niches, pilasters and scallop shell pediments. The original bar counter retains a former spittoon trough made of marble, which runs all along the front, and the bar top has two working brass water taps. Designed in 1891 by George Lyle, it has a fine ceiling with very decorative cornices and it was refitted in 1906. The magnificent interior features a tiled and extraordinary four-bay mirrored arcading all the way down the right-hand side with hand-painted pictorial tiles with allegorical figures by William B. Simpson & Sons of London. Below the arcading are red leather seating areas and tables inlaid with maps, some of the city and some of Scotland. \r\n\r\nOn the left by the entrance is the intact tiny jug and bottle dept. complete with hatch, one of the few left in the city. In 2002 S&N removed the 'Office' created by a carved wood screen perched on top of the bar counter on the right. There are superb stained glass windows as well as door panels advertising 'Jeffrey\u2019s Lager & W & J Jenkinson's Bottled Beers & Aerated Waters, Leith'. There are a number of coloured and gilded engraved brewery advertising mirrors from Bernard's, Usher's, Campbell's, Taylor Macleod & Co and Bell's Perth Whisky. Other changes have been the removal of a small snug at the rear; while a sitting room at the rear is now an office.  At the rear right is the Green Room, which was added in 1906. Accessed from Valleyfield Street, it has an ornate bar counter and gantry, but both are modern.",

        "Address": "1 Queensferry Street, Edinburgh, EH2 4PA",
        "Description": "This high-ceilinged, male-dominated, single-room pub is little changed in over 100 years. It is located on the ground floor of a five-storey red ashlar building, designed in 1900 by Sydney Mitchell & Wilson for the National Commercial Bank of Scotland (entrance on the corner of Shandwick Place) and the Caledonian United Services Club (on first and second floors). The wine merchant Hugh Mather, established the licensed premises in 1902. A ground floor refacing in 1938-40 by Tarbolton & Ochterlony added a reddish polished stone below the windows. The two deeply moulded broad arch front windows have multi-beveled glass panes.  \r\n\r\nThe good quality early 20th century decorative scheme by Sidney Mitchell remains largely intact. Within the vestibule entrance porch is colourful floor-to-ceiling tiling. The original ceiling-height finely carved gantry has segmental-arched pediments to side, split pediment to centre with arches mirrors (some modern) between slender Ionic columns, and glazed cabinets below. In the 1980's two small \u2018winged\u2019 sections were added at the top of each end \u2013 produced by local firm Sutherland & Denholm. Only a couple of fridges have replaced part of the lower shelving. The original panelled bar counter has a new top and at each end of it are still-working water taps - whisky is the only spirit that can benefit from a little added water. The original tiled and wood surround fireplace has a mantelpiece featuring pilasters with an oval bevelled mirror, old dado panelling remains but the fixed seating is modern.  \r\n\r\nThe room has an elaborate compartmented ceiling with deeply moulded cornice and fine plaster frieze of birds and swags of fruit picked out in cream on a claret background. The walls are adorned by a number of old brewery mirrors from Campbell\u2019s, Edinburgh & Leith Brewery,  Mackay's, McEwans and Wm Younger. The main change has been the removal in 1957 of a short glazed partition that created a small sitting room that was situated in the rear right corner. The seating in this area remained unchanged but a table and seating attached to the partition was lost. The part of the counter on the return was added as part of these changes. High up above this area are two doors and lattice windows behind which is a large fan. Above the staircase down to the present toilets is a large water tank (panelled over) that was required to create the pressure for the Scottish system of dispensing beer. The old water engine part of the system (one of the last remaining examples) is still in situ in the cellar and staff may allow you to inspect it at quiet times.",

        "Description": "This small basic pub built in 1811 is the least altered pub in Edinburgh - it is much as it was in the late 19th century. Can you spot those customers and people behind the bar on whom Ian Rankin based his characters in the Inspector Rebus novels? If not, just ask and they will tell you. The tiny stand-up bar in the front left of the pub, with no tables or chairs, and just two sets of bare window seating for about four people set in the dark wood dado panelling on the nicotine-mustard walls just as it was. There is an old fireplace on the far left partly covered up by the bar itself. The pub looks full with a dozen or so customers in it. The mirrored gantry, which has a noticeable slope and some added shelves, dates from the late 19th century, as does the bar counter, but the bar top is a replacement. \r\n\r\nNote the old 'Bernard's India Pale Ale' cemented-on lettering on the upper front window - only one letter has been lost. Up three steps and through the doorway on the right is a basic, dimly-lit sitting room with shutters on the windows. There is a 1950s brick fireplace and an old 'Murray's Pale Ale' mirror. On the wall of the sitting room is a photo of the bar and former landlord William Ross, who refused to serve women and Englishmen, and anyone ordering a lager would be instantly barred!",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nTwo-room pub in a single-storey Victorian building, the interior, which looks as though it has seen better days, is a real time warp. It has been in the hands of the same family since 1958 and seems to have been completely refitted immediately thereafter. The most distinctive features in the public bar (left) are the suspended beams forming an open canopy over the servery and the small Formica-topped tables in the public bar. The lounge has a hatch to the servery with typically c.1960 lettering over \u2018Service\u2019; an adjacent bell is for attracting attention. No-one could argue that the work stands comparison with the rich work of the late Victorian or Edwardian pub or even the some of the sleek, sophisticated work of the 1930s, but the basic nature of most early post-war pub furnishing means it has fallen victim to later change and Rutherford\u2019s is a rare example of where it can be seen in a complete scheme.

        "Description": "A magnificent island-bar pub built in 1899 in a four-storey sandstone tenement by architect P L Henderson. Similar to the Abbotsford, it is well worth going out of your way to visit. It is unique, having a gantry-like structure on the top left-hand side of the bar counter and a series of low, ticket booth-style windows for service, which are numbered on the inside. This arrangement is akin to snob screens in Victorian pubs in English cities which allowed more affluent patrons of the lounge bar to obtain their liquor through low serving hatches and preserve some privacy from public bar customers. This is one of only a handful of pubs selling its own whisky, a fine blended whisky distilled by Inverary. On the left as you enter is a small snug separated from the lounge by a low, panelled screen with a door and semi-circular stained glass panels. Note the hinged section of the bar counter in the snug for which nobody has been able to provide an explanation \u2013 any help on this matter is most welcome. \r\n\r\nAt the far end of the counter is an elegant mahogany gantry with original Bryson clock. Other original features include a Lincrusta frieze, an ornate plaster cornice and highly decorative ceiling. The dado panelling came from a neighbouring house during a restoration in 1958. At the rear of the lounge is another snug with a wide doorway, half-height panelled walls, and ceiling also from 1958. In 1971 a former shop was absorbed to become a sitting room and has a wide doorway and dado panelled walls that match the 1958 wall panelling. The window screens date from 2005. John Leslie was the second licensee, from 1902 to 1924.",

        "Description": "This is one of Edinburgh's most famous pubs. Its stunning interior includes nine Doulton's tiled murals, seven are of famous inventors each at their moment of their discovery. Built in 1862 and a pub since 1901, the main Circle Bar has a white marble floor, panelled dado, foliate Rococo-style frieze and delightful compartmented ceiling. The original majestic octagonal island serving counter, which dated from 1901, was replaced in 1979 by an equally ornate one, and a new high gantry was installed in 2002. The original fine marble fireplace with a very elaborate overmantel is still there, as are leather seating areas.  The six tiled murals by Doultons of Lambeth, London, and designed by John Eyre feature 'William Caxton, citizen of London who brought printing into England 1476' 'Benjamin Franklin, printer distinguished in science and politics', 'Robert Peel makes his first experiment in calico printing', 'Michael Faraday, discoverer of electro-magnetism', 'George Stephenson', and 'James Watt inventor of the condensing engine & his partner Matthew Bolton'. They were first displayed at the 1886 International Exhibition of Industry, Science and Art held on The Meadows in the style of the 1851 Great Exhibition in London.\r\n\r\nOther magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; General Havelock, Hastings, East Sussex; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; St James Tavern, Soho, London W1;Dolphin, Hackney, London E8; andGolden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nBeyond a 1901 ornately carved walnut screen with a number of bevelled and engraved mirror panels by John Taylor & Son of Princes Street lies the Oyster Bar. Three of the tiled murals are in this upmarket restaurant along with eight superb large stained glass windows of British sportsmen by Ballantine & Gardiner. It still retains the original counter of red marble, and there are small tiled panels on the bar front and behind the bar. Other features of note are the grey and white diamond-shaped marble tiled floor, a rich scrolled frieze, an elaborate ceiling with gilt embellishments, a revolving door installed in the 1920s and fine original fittings in the gents' downstairs, approached by a marble staircase. The three tiled murals in the restaurant are of  'Louis J. M. Daguerre, scene-painter & Joseph Nicephore Niepce joint discoverers of photography', also two designed by Esther Lewis of a Liverpool paddle steamer and the Cunard liner Umbria, which was built in the Govan shipyard on the Clyde.",

The walls are covered in blue and white Minton tiles, topped-off with rows of brown and white tiles finishing some two-thirds up the double-height public bar, which has a patterned plasterwork ceiling in red and cream. Built c.1780, the interior, by architect Thomas Purves Marwick, dates from 1899 and was subject to a very costly renovation by Alloa Brewery in 1966 using architects Covell Matthews. They restored the splendid mahogany island bar to its original position and renovated the decoratively carved front with its brass match-strikers under the rim; unfortunately, part of the right-hand side was lost in changes prior to 1966. \r\n\r\nEven the damaged tiles were restored using majolica and it is difficult to distinguish them from the original Victorian ones. The original tiles have a smooth finish and much of the crazing (crack-like markings on the tiles due to ageing) is more like scratches; where the tiles have a relief/rough finish and the crazing forms a pattern the tiles are the restored/replacement ones. There is a massive Dryborough's of Edinburgh mirror. The short partitioning attached to the bar, and the pot-shelf are 1966 additions, which is the date the Scott Room, a small lounge / family room, was added down a new passage to the rear. Note the stained glass windows on the front and side in the first-floor area.\r\n\r\nListing upgraded to A in 2008 as a result of survey work by CAMRA.",

        "Address": "227 High St., Prestonpans, EH32 9BE",
        "Description": "This pub is of great importance both for its superb Edwardian fittings and because it is run along Gothenburg lines. It was built in 1908 of red sandstone for the East of Scotland Public Houses Trust in Arts and Crafts style and still retains its original interior. The pub was sold to the London-based Trust Houses Ltd in 1919 and then in 1965 to Bass and operated as a conventional commercial pub. By the mid-1990s it was failing, and in 2001 it was closed but passed into the hands of the present enlightened ownership. After meticulously restoration, it re-opened in 2003 and won the CAMRA national conservation award for the quality of the work. The public bar is a wonderful room with superbly designed features \u2013 low, segmental arches at the sides with vertical struts, deep green tiles, panelling and a spectacular jug bar. The latter involves a tiny cubicle (with a seat on the right) in front of the entrance lobby and includes woodwork of considerable intricacy. \r\n\r\nTo the left is an elegantly panelled lounge used mainly for food and non-alcoholic refreshments. Since 2001 the building has been extended at the rear to include a small brewery (opened May 2004). There are further rooms upstairs all with modern fittings. The Gothenburg system originated in the Swedish city in 1865 as a means of encouraging temperance. A key principle was that managers gained no benefit from alcohol sales but did so from food and non-alcoholic drinks. Profits above a certain percentage (usually 5%, as here) were devoted to projects for the benefit of the community.",

Ltd. lettering on its colourful fa\u00efence exterior, which gives you an indication of what to expect inside. In 1978 it was under threat of demolition for road widening but a campaign saved it and then Brains carried out a restoration, reopening the pub in 1986. On entering you will see some spectacular Craven Dunnill decorative tilework on the walls of the main public bar in various shades of brown and green on the dado and yellow and green above, topped off with a colourful floral pattern frieze above. The tiles also run up the side of the open staircase. The long L-shaped counter is one of only fourteen remaining ceramic bar counters left in the whole of the UK and features grotesques on the frontage and is the reason for its inclusion on the National Inventory. There is another equally impressive counter in Wales at the Waterloo, Newport. \r\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. \r\n\r\nThere are also two hand-painted pictorial panels \u2013 the large one in the public bar is of Cardiff Castle in 1903. In the left-hand room is a hand-painted pictorial tile painting of the Old Town Hall in 1863. It was one of two completed by Craven Dunnill of Jackfield, Shropshire for the opening of the pub in 1903. (There is also a tiled panel of Brains Old Brewery in St Mary Street, Cardiff at around 1890 in the left hand lobby but this dates probably from the reopening in 1986). \r\n\r\nOther magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Caf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; General Havelock, Hastings, Sussex, East; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; Dolphin, Hackney, London E8; and St James Tavern, Soho, London W1.\r\n\r\nThe impressive original bar-backs remain in the public bar and in the lounge (right), but the counter in the latter is modern. There has been some opening-up to the rear of the public bar and this area, which is popular with diners, has modern fittings. The pub has a good set of Brain's leaded windows. Please note that this is Cardiff city centre's premier gay pub in the evenings with live music late Sun. and late Wed. Open all day until 2am (3am Sat.). \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Cardiff there is one other notable ceramic pub frontage - Queens Vaults, 29 Westgate Street CF10 1DA (opposite the Millennium Stadium) with a bright yellow one including elaborate lettering of \u2018Queens Vaults', 'Wines', 'Ind Coope & Co. Ltd. Entire', \u2018Entire\u2019 being a beer better known as porter. \r\n\r\n(There was another at The Vulcan, 10 Adam Street, Cardiff CF24 2FH, with a lovely brown and green glazed ceramic frontage)",

        "Description": "One of the last remaining examples in Wales of a traditional beer house, a domestic property where you can drink in a number of the rooms - still today the 'overspill room' resembles living quarters. The Goat is a rendered house in the middle of the village only distinguished by a pub sign on the side and has been in the same family for four generations. It was originally attached to a dairy and sheep farm, but the land was sold off in 1978. The front door with the figure '1' (a licensing requirement, not part of the pub\u2019s address) leads to the original main public room. The original main public room at the Goat, Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa, looks very domestic and small enough to appear like a hallway. Now acting as the overspill room if the public bar is busy, it has a 1950s tiled fireplace and a piano that is occasionally played. \r\n\r\nOriginally there were two other small rooms - the 'Bar bach' (small bar) situated to the rear left and another at the end of the passage still with the figure '3' on the door but both of these are now in domestic use only. This follows the decision taken by the present licensee\u2019s parents just after they took over in 1956 to convert the room on the right, previously used by the local landowner to collect his rent from tenant farmers, into the public bar.  \"My parents wanted to concentrate the drinkers in one main room rather than being all over the house\"! The public bar has a bar counter and bar back shelves installed in c.1956. It already had an old fireplace and is otherwise unchanged with most of the seating consisting of settees, which have to be moved to play darts. \r\n\r\nDespite its closeness to the English border, this part of Montgomeryshire has a strong and vibrant Welsh-language culture. On the second Sunday of the New Year the village holds a plygain service \u2013 an unscripted two hours of singing traditional carols in Welsh. Many groups associated with this and related activities use the Goat as a meeting-place so you may find a rehearsal/choir practice here, giving the pub a cultural importance commensurate with its visible heritage. The village's delightful name means \"church of St Michael in Paradise\". Open evenings from 8pm (possibly before - just knock on the back door!). Although closed lunchtimes it may be possible to arrange a visit between 11 and 3 if you ring to arrange it. Closed all day on Sundays (a decision by the licensee) and may be closed while there is an event on in the village hall so best to ring if planning a visit.",

The screen on the passageway side still has a tiny window to let the smoke out (the room had a 1950s tiled fireplace until the 1970s) and old 'Truman's Burton Ales' mirror, but the panelling and seating in this room are modern. The rear left room with '2' on the hatch door still retains old panelling with simple bench seating attached.

The front left small room has a distinctive 1950s tiled fireplace and modern fixed seating. The main bar has shelves on a ply-panelled wall added in 1948 but the present counter dates from the mid-1980s and the fireplace is modern.",

        "Address": "Salop Rd, Welshpool, SY21 7EZ",
        "Description": "Built in 1835, this is an end of terrace pub with a tiny snug bar barely changed in 100 years whose bar fittings face, unusually, towards the back, not the front of the pub. This remained as a four-room-and-corridor pub until, sadly, the owners decided to \"move with the times\" (licensee's words) and knock down walls to amalgamate the two left-hand rooms; open the combined room to the corridor; and replace the hatch in the corridor with a new small bar counter. The reason given for these changes is that the pub supports three football teams and there was not enough room for them on a Saturday! \r\n\r\nThe tiny snug bar at the rear right retains a 100 year-old-bar counter, old shelves for a bar back, and bench seating at least 60 years old, and the counter is a Formica one from the 1960s. The lounge bar at the front probably only came into public use in the 1950s when they cut a hatch into the wall for service to the back of the bar. The small room has a lovely 1950s tiled fireplace and the fixed seating is probably from that date. Outside toilets (under cover) at the rear. Tune sessions last Thu. of the month. Opens at 5.30pm Mon-Fri and all day Sat-Sun.",

        "Pub Name": "Lion Royal",
        "Address": "West Street, Rhayader, LD6 5AB",
        "Description": "Following the death of the owner, the Lion Royal is not often open, but may be so on Saturday evening from 6pm if there are guests, normally from April and over the summer months. The great attraction is a wonderfully untouched bar of 1921 at the rear - a real classic.\n\r\nThis unashamedly old-fashioned coaching inn retains a small bar at the rear, unchanged since 1921. It has 'Bar' in an etched and frosted panel on the door, wood-block floor, a wonderful bar counter with Jacobean detailing in the frontage, and two sets of bar-back shelves at right angles to each other One one of these has a display of 'Gin\u2019, \u2018Brandy\u2019 and \u2018Rum' ceramic spirit vessels, a row of pewter mugs etc. on the shelves: even the ancient 'National' cash register is still in use. The bar fittings appear all of a piece and along with the glazed brick and marble/polished stone fireplace and two sections of bench seating almost certainly date from 1920s. An extension to the rear of the bar has a parquet-floored small room no longer in use. Note the bell-pushes labelled 'Chambermaids' and 'Boots' - the latter referring to having your boots cleaned overnight and then placed outside your door. This service ceased in the 1950s but the bell-pushes are still in working order!\n\r\nThe lounge in the front left has a large stone fireplace, settle, and a light oak bar counter by a local craftsman. installed in 1969. This was the year of Prince Charles' investiture as Prince of Wales - hence the crown and Prince of Wales' feathers as well as the lion head symbols. The bar is only usually open at weekends or for groups of people staying at the hotel \u2013 Welsh real ale can be ordered by your party. If you are planning to visit you are recommended to ring ahead.\n\r\nAmazingly, stabling for six horses and a 3/4 acre paddock are still in use as this is a base for horse-riding holidays (British Horse Society approved) from May to early October and you can bring your own horse or use one owned by the hotel. The hotel has been used as a courtroom, the seat of the Customs and Excise, and in 1904 the inaugural meeting of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society. Until 1904 it was known as the Red Lion and is at least 200 years old.",

        "Description": "This two-storey late Georgian village pub with four small rooms is a splendid survivor being little altered since the 1930s.\r\n\r\nThe slate-floored drinking lobby has a tiny hatch in the leaded screen around the servery, which would have also been the off-sales, and occasionally customers can be seen drinking here. A sliding door leads to the tiny front bar with an old counter, old panelling on the window side, a 1930s tiled fireplace with a coal fire and bare bench seating, including some attached to the front of the counter - something that may be unique in a pub anywhere. The intimate space means visitors are quickly drawn into conversation.\r\n\r\nAt the rear the lounge is served from a bar more like a hatch with its sliding window, now kept permanently open. This room retains fixed seating dating from the 1930s and a post-war fireplace. To the front right is the small snug with a cast-iron fireplace.\r\n\r\nLook for the number of the doors, a requirement of H M Customs and Excise to denote all the rooms in a public house used for the storage or sale of alcohol. There is a '4' on the door to the lounge; a '5' on the door to the rear right room, which has been in use as a dining room in the past; and '6' on the cellar door. The Fox retains a disused, but rarely seen, cask pump - a way of serving beer direct from a cask with the added benefit of serving it with a good 'head' - if not visible just ask to see it.",

        "Pub Name": "Douglas Arms Hotel",
        "Address": "Ogwen Terrace, High Street (A5), Bethesda, LL57 3AY",
        "Description": "A coaching inn built c.1820 to serve Thomas Telford's new road to Holyhead. It has been in the same family since 1913 and is little changed since the 1930s with four public rooms. Tradition is the order of the day here \u2013 it was possibly the last pub to convert to decimal currency and even today staff can quote you the cost of your round in \u00a3.s.d. In the spacious corridor there is an old servery facing the front door. The public bar lies to the rear right and until the 1950s it was actually two small rooms but then a partition creating a separate snug was removed. What looks like a hatch on the left was actually the door into the snug and to access it from the hall there was originally a short passage across the corner of the servery. The splendid over 100-year-old bar-back contains many drawers, a display of spirit jars and 25 malt whiskies. The public bar has two bentwood benches and a red leather bench; the now disused fireplace dates from the 1920s. Near the counter, which was re-fronted in recent times, there is the old speaking tube (now painted over), which was used to give instructions to the kitchen below. Originally access to the public bar was via a door on the right-hand side of the building. \r\n\r\nOn the rear left is the billiard room, which is the combination of the former hotel reception and a room/lounge. The full-sized table was moved to here from an upstairs room in  c.1934 and the rare game of Snooker Plus is played here. It was invented by Joe Davis in 1959 and includes two extra balls - an orange (scores 8) and a purple (scores 10). This means the possible maximum break is 210, something not even 15 times world champion Joe could score! (but it is believed to have been achieved by Jimmy White, date unknown). Other Heritage pubs still with full sized billiard tables are the Lamb, Eccles, Manchester, Gtr; and the Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire. \r\n\r\nThe room has old bench seating, an early 20th-century tiled fireplace (there was another behind the seating) and a hatch to the back of the bar. At the front are two rooms - on the left a small function/dining room which has a tiled and marble surround fireplace; on the right is the smoke room with a 1930s Art Deco wood surround fireplace that has a new tiled interior on a Welsh slate base, antique settles and lovely benches. The inside toilets were added in 1955.",

        "Pub Name": "Albion Ale House",
        "Address": "Upper Gate Street, Conwy, LL32 8RF",
        "Description": "Re-built in 1921, this is by far the best surviving example of an interwar pub in Wales. It has three well-preserved rooms and the only significant changes were in the late 1970s by Ansells Brewery and include the incorporation of the off-sales into the public bar (on the right-hand side). The exterior has a brick ground floor, and pebble-dashed first floor with a touch of Tudor half-timbering. There are three well-preserved rooms approached off a corridor with some attractive green tiling in the dado and red tiling on the floor. The pub closed for a year or so and was rescued by an enterprising businessman. After a sensitive refurbishment, it reopened in February 2012 as the Albion Ale House selling real ales from four north Welsh micro-breweries. It is an excellent example of how to  restore a heritage pub interior \u2013 also, it is making a success of concentrating on the essentials of a good pub i.e. good conversation and good beer \u2013 there is no TV, no juke box, fruit machine or pool table. The Albion won the CAMRA/English Heritage 2013 Pub Design Awards in the conservation category.\r\n\r\nThe public bar (right) retains its original counter and new owner has added a new top over the original \u2013 look for the join. Also retained is the fine mirrored bar-back incorporating a round clock by Parnell & Sons, Birmingham, and lots of shelves with columns. The counter front and bar-back fitting have recently been rubbed down to the bare wood and French polished to look a lovely shade of light brown. Only three sections of the lower bar-back shelves have been removed to accommodate two fridges for bottles and one for snack storage. The original brick fireplace in the public bar has been painted black. The corner fixed seating in the public bar has been re-positioned as it covers the original door \u2013 it possibly rested against the partition that separated the public bar from the off sales? Black paint has been removed from the ceiling beam. The public bar has a bare wood floor whereas the other two rooms have parquet floors. Locals say the original parquet floor was ripped up to be used as firewood \u2013 in the 1970s the landlord kicked up a loose piece one night and then threw it on the fire so, locals say, the rest of the wood blocks went the same way! That said, the boarding looks old and it would have been appropriate to have such basic flooring in a public bar and wood blocks in the 'better' rooms and the replacement story seems a bit fanciful. \r\n\r\nA partition with glass panels on the top once separated the off sales from the public bar. You can see markings on the counter where the partition was fixed. When removed in the late 1970s the partition was attached to the wall on the right side of the room and covers a tiled dado. The present owners have carefully removed a tiny selection of panelling to expose some of the 1921 brown tiled dado. The former off-sales entrance has a \u2018Public Bar\u2019 panel in the door (revealed by a previous licensee which had a dartboard over it). Originally it may have had a \u2018Off Sales\u2019 or \u2018Jug & Bottle\u2019 one so it is likely the panel was originally on the original door to the public bar from the hallway into the public bar (but locals claim that originally stated \u2018Men Only\u2019!). \r\n\r\nThe plans for the rebuilding in 1921 show that originally the door into the bar was just inside the lobby, but moved further back in the late 1970s - hence there are no tiles on the right-hand side of the lobby but they remain intact in the lobbies and passageway. In the hallway the mainly red-tiled floor runs to the rear and it looks as if the staircase, originally an open one, now locked, is a later addition. However, the green dado wall-tiling continues up the left-hand side of the staircase to the first floor. The top section of the green dado tiling is missing below a window looking into the left hand smoke room so was presumable removed (damaged?) when the window was added \u2018for supervision purposes\u2019 in the late 1970s. \r\n\r\nAfter many years of closure the entrance on the Bangor Road side with a 'Smoke Room' panel in the exterior door has been re-opened \u2013 it has a black and white tiled floor, lovely shades of brown dado Art Nouveau tiling and twin inner doors with round-headed doorway \u2013 note the \u2018Room\u2019 etched glass door panel is a recent replacement for a long lost original one (locals say it has a bullet hole in it!) with the \u2018Smoke\u2019 and other plain panels being the originals. In the angle of the streets is a smoke room, now called the Lounge, with an impressive baronial-style fireplace set behind a timber and brick canopy. Recently black paint has been removed from the heavy timber over the inglenook fireplace and taken back to the bare timber. The interior of the inglenook is now well-illuminated making the fireplace the stunning feature it was meant to be. Note the quality design of creating an alcove with 1920s round brick arch matching that of the inner doors of the lobby i.e. left and right of the inglenook. The alcove has fixed seating for just two people. The fitted seating in the alcove and both sides of the inglenook are not 1921 originals but were added later. The room retains its original seating still with bell-pushes. The room has Art Nouveau stained, ellipse-shaped windows, but has lost its door. \r\n\r\nThe rear Smoke Room is served via a hatch, which still retains its doors that can be closed. The smoke room has an impressive wide brick and tile fireplace, and retains its fixed seating, bell-pushes and a parquet floor with an unusual diamond-shaped feature. Now called the Snug, it has a 'Smoke Room' etched panel on the door and there is one original decorative etched window but the right hand side one has been lost. The room is popular for meetings, particularly as the hatch has retained its doors, which can be closed for privacy. The present ladies\u2019 was the original gents - in 1949 an extension was added to create new gents\u2019 toilets.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2016: Manager Stuart Chapman-Edwards is having the bell-push system brought back to life in the two smoke rooms so, unless the pub isn\u2019t too busy, you won\u2019t need to leave the comfort of your seat to get a beer. He\u2019s acquired an indicator box from about 1900 which by now should be connected up to the bell-pushes. A great tradition revived.",

This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nThis is a no-frills market-town time-warp pub without a bar counter.  \u2028\n\nTucked away in the corner of the market place with no inn sign to help you, this is the Red Lion, Llandovery. Please note that you will not find it open often either. The building itself is 18th-and 19th-century and part may be older still. It has a two-storey, symmetrical frontage to the Market Square and has the attractive feature of a pentice roof (supported on iron columns running the whole length of the building and sheltering the ground floor). The front door leads to a red quarry-tiled passage and, just past the inner doors, the bar is a small room on the right with a small alcove at the front called 'the lounge' which is filled with bric-a-brac. \n\nThe public bar is a simple affair with dado panelling and movable tables and seats and a fireplace. One bench has a high back and there is no counter. There is a small hatch and a door leading to the cellar servery at the rear of the bar room and you can see a stillage with a few casks of beer sitting on it. Find a seat around the large square table and landlord John Rees (who is likely to be sitting amongst you) will take your order from a limited range of drinks. Please note the wit of John Rees is not for the faint hearted! The pub has been in his family since 1871 and very little has changed in that time. There was another public room - the smoke room - which is on the left of the passage and has a '1' on the door but it is no longer in use and is used for storage. Only open Fri. from 5.30 to 10.30; Sat. from 12 to 2 and 7 to 11.",

There is not a bar counter as such - just an opening with horizontally-sliding sashes to the ground-floor cellar that is opened for service and closed afterwards. The pebble-dashed building is dated 1845 and looks more like a house as there is no hanging inn sign, just a small one above the now disused original main door. The pub has been in the same family ownership since built and is affectionately known as 'Bessie's' after the characterful octogenarian licensee; Welsh language conversation predominates in this pub. \r\n\r\nThe heart of the pub is a squarish public bar with a medley of furniture including an old high-back seat/box settle and a low basic bench - there is virtually nothing to distinguish this from an ordinary domestic room. The floor has red and black quarry tiles and there is a rough stone fireplace, which might have been introduced in c.1960. The beer is served via a glass jug into your glass - one of only two pubs in Wales still using this time-honoured way of selling beer - the other is the highly recommended Cresselly Arms at Cresswell Quay. Other Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Barley Mow, Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire; Holly Bush, Makeney, Derbyshire; Star, Bath, Somerset; Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire Falcon, Arncliffe, North Yorkshire; and Cresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales.\r\n \r\n\r\nA second room, the lounge, which is sometimes brought into use, lies across a corridor from the public bar. The main entrance is now down a passage on the right in an attached building where the only feature that extends beyond the purely functional is the light brown and black dado tiling dating from 1938. Almost without exception, pubs are now stand-alone businesses but here at the Dyffryn Arms, the pub is still linked to a smallholding with ten acres of farmland plus six of woodland. Other Heritage Pubs with working farms attached and run by the licensee or their family members are the \r\nLuppitt Inn, Luppitt ; \r\nQuiet Woman, Earl Sterndale; \r\nVictoria Arms, Worton ; \r\nand\r\nNew Cross Inn, Court Henry . \r\n\r\n\r\nOutside gents' and ladies'.

There is also a charity event on the Saturday of the May Bank Holiday weekend with stalls outside the pub. It is usually open from 11 to 12, but may close at 10 if there are no customers; open 12 to 10.30 Sun.",

The bar counter has a carved front, traditional brass foot rail, a former spittoon trough made of terrazzo and an emery paper strip for striking matches under the counter lip. Look for the telephone box subtly hidden behind the panelling by the door to the bar (the telephone has long gone). \n\nOn the far right is a lounge with an Art Deco feel to it, which was converted from a cobbler's shop in post-war times and undoubtedly designed to match the Walnut Lounge.

        "Description": "The Coach & Horses was built in 1937 with a rendered exterior and replaced an older establishment of the same name (its forerunner, now a private house, stands opposite). It is a suburban-style pub in a village setting and has hardly altered since built. For Thirties planning to survive so completely in a pub of this type and size is exceptional indeed, and makes this a true national rarity. As an 'improved' pub of its time, it was designed to look respectable and to offer varied facilities \u2013 a commodious 'best' smoke room with bell-pushes, a \u2018refreshment room\u2019; an entirely separate public bar; and the notably northern feature of a stand-up lobby. \r\n\r\nIt was designed by Doncaster architects Wilburn & Atkinson for the brewers Whitworth, Son & Nephew (of nearby Wath-upon-Dearne) whose wheatsheaf logo appears on the lovely glazed counter-screens that are such a signature feature of its interior. Sashed screenwork like this is rarely found in such intact form \u2013 and it is at its most authentic in the refreshment room where the bar-counter too is original. Ceilings, doors, fitted seating and tiling are all from the 1937 scheme and the substantial bar back-fitting, with its plain styling and multiple drawers, is noteworthy in its own right. Statutorily listed in 2010 following a successful application by CAMRA. \r\n\r\nWhitworth, Son & Nephew were acquired by John Smith\u2019s Tadcaster Brewery Co. Ltd. in 1958 with 165 tied houses and brewing ceased. After a number of years in pub company ownership; and closed since 2016; in 2020 it was purchased by enlightened new owners who have carried out an exemplary refurbishment so a visit is highly recommended and is rewarded by being able to drink tasty locally produced real ales from the Don Valley Brewery. \r\n\r\nThe door on the far left of the building originally lead to the off sales which is now in use as a kitchenette area. The door retains its original glazed panel above. The lobby has wall tiling in claret, etc. to two-thirds height. Inner door lost, this narrow space with more colourful tiling on both walls still retains the bell push situated where originally there would have been a counter. \r\n\r\nEnter by the main left hand corner doors which lead to a lobby with original tiling to two thirds height on left and right sides. There are double doors in an inner screen where the top windows are original and in 2020 similar leaded windows were added at the lower level to match the style of the originals. The spacious lobby bar has a parquet floor with an Art Deco design added in 2020. The bar counter front had been covered by fresh panels in the 1970s and in 2020 these were removed to reveal the original 1937 one which has been renovated. The upper sections of the sash screens remain but the lower ones were removed some years ago and placed in the cellar; bar top has been replaced. Note some original Whitworth\u2019s memorabilia on the walls. \r\n\r\nOff the lobby bar the gents\u2019 toilet retains its original interwar floor tiling and dado wall tiling, the latter having had the paint added in recent years recently removed (modern urinal). The ladies' also retain the original white & dark green floor tiles and interwar dado wall tiling with paint removed recently. \r\n\r\nTo the left is what was originally called the refreshment room and now named the whisky bar. This has a new parquet floor, the counter screen here are intact with four rising lower sections but the pulley system was in poor condition. As an example of the amazing restoration carried out by the new owners, they identified the original producers and their reference number; made contact with the company based in the USA; ordered four replacement pulleys so the screens are now back in working order. The bar counter here is the original one. Undistinguished dado panelling has been removed with fresh panels added above the dado. There are bell pushes around the room and a piano can be found here. A whisky cabinet has been built in the style of glazing in the pub so it looks like it has always been here. The original cornice remains but the other ceiling decoration is new. The lower sash screens from three of the four serveries was found in the cellar but the wood was rotten so they have carefully converted them into window screens \u2013 three panels can be found on the whisky room window and another one is part of a modern baffle-style projection near the door; two panels have Whitworth\u2019s brewery wheatsheaf symbol. \r\n\r\nTo the right of the lobby bar is the lounge bar (was the smoke room) which has a new parquet floor; another servery where the original counter front has been re-exposed; and the four upper panels of the sash screens remain; bar top is a replacement. The 1930s fixed seating has been carefully restored; there are bell pushes around the room; the original fireplace was replaced in the 1960s and now there is one with Victorian tiles and a coal burning stove. Wood panelling above the dado is a recent addition and the original cornice forms part of the ceiling decoration. Again, former screenwork has been converted into window screens and one forms a modern baffle-style projection near the door that is suitable to use for vertical drinking! \r\n\r\nThe tap room (originally the public bar) has its own entrance on the right hand side with double doors. Above the doors the original glazing exists and from this the new owners have copied and added a colourful diamond shaped panels in the doors. The lobby has colourful interwar tiling to two-thirds height. The inner doors are in a screen where previously damaged original glazed panels had been replaced by plain ones and now have careful copies of original ones inserted (modern wording on door). There are two baffles by the entrance (and two on the right) where again some glazing is modern but difficult to spot the difference. \r\n\r\nThe tap room also has a new parquet floor and the screened servery faces three ways in a \u2018thrupenny bit\u2019 way. Again, the original counter front has been re-exposed; the four upper panels of the sash screens remain; the bar top is a replacement. The original fireplace was replaced in the 1960s with a stone one and there is a tiled and cast-iron one here now. High up above the fireplace is a little Andy Capp mural from the 1970s and now worthy of remark. Original fixed seating has been restored. The gents\u2019 toilet here is intact with its two large Shanks urinals, original cistern, interwar floor tiling and dado wall tiling with paint removed recently. The ladies' also retain the original white and dark green floor tiles and interwar dado wall tiling with paint removed recently. \r\n\r\nThe bar back for all the bars has three distinct sections all with a row of drawers below the main shelf, also two vertical sets of drawers, and lower shelving retained but has had sliding cupboard drawers added but otherwise is in intact. As one would expect, the position for a fridge has been carefully chosen and nothing removed to insert it.",

        "Description": "This is one of the best-preserved examples in the whole UK of a smaller Thirties road-house and one whose revival has been a recent success story. Originally built to serve traffic on the old Great North Road, which then ran straight through the town, it was sold-off in 2003 by its long-time family owners and narrowly escaped conversion to a Chinese restaurant. Thanks partly to its statutory listing, successfully sought by CAMRA in 2000, it has re-emerged relatively unscathed. Apart from losing original fitted seating and sustaining two enlarged openings between rooms (one now sensitively hung with double doors) its interior differs only slightly from the original 1929 plans drawn up by Knaresborough architect Sydney Blenkhorn. Its fittings, which include quality oak bar structures, oak fire surrounds and attractive  stained glass, are all from the original 1930 building scheme by Hepworth & Co, a small Ripon brewery for whom this would doubtless have been a prestige project.",

        "Description": "Part of a three-storey terrace of eight houses built in the second quarter of the 19th century in what is now an up and coming area of historic Liverpool. This small pub and former hotel has two public rooms separated by a corridor-cum-drinking lobby with a red herringbone with black edging quarry tiled floor. The pub boasts some excellent etched glass, notably the curved panel of a Renaissance courtier entitled 'music' in a partition alongside the inner door. There is also excellent etched and cut glass depicting a variety of birds in waterside settings in the still-working sashes forming the five-bay screen that reaches to the ceiling between the drinking lobby and the servery. They act as a series of three hatches for service to the lobby and also serve the smoke room; the far right one is not used; and the far left one is just a panel over the doorway to the bar servery.\n\r\nThe Bar on the right has a door with a 'Bar' etched window and stained and leaded panel above, front windows with 'Hotel' 'Bar' in two of four decorative etched windows. This room with an amazingly limited space for drinkers retains its early twentieth century curved bar front and the front wall has pink painted tongue 'n' groove panelling with wall benches attached on the right hand side. However, the bar-back fitting is all modern work \u2013 the original basic bar back having been removed when it closed as a pub in 2003-6 and became offices although its statutory listed status preserved the rest of the interior. In its place is a new door in the middle leading to a bottle store, and on the left the shelving is partly old and partly new. The fireplace is also modern work and the exterior door on the right is no longer used.\n\r\nOn the left is the high-ceilinged Smoke Room which has a 'Smoke Room' etched window in the door. and set of front windows. It retains a wood surround fireplace possibly dating from 1910-20 but the tiles are modern. Panelled walls have replaced the tiled dado in recent years (old photos seen) and the seating is modern. The toilets off the lobby have been modernised.",

What\u2019s more, with its complete lack of counter service (drinks coming straight from a sunken, off-corridor cellar) the Eagle represents a historic form of pub-planning and operation that has otherwise disappeared from Yorkshire and of which only ten other examples are known, from CAMRA\u2019s own careful researches, to survive in England. \n\nIn 2005, with unsympathetic changes by its new owner (a local builder) looking likely, CAMRA sought emergency spot-listing.

        "Pub Name": "Sloans",
        "Address": "Argyll Arcade, Glasgow, City Centre, G2 8BG",
        "Description": "A visit to Sloans should be made during the daytime so you can see its exceptional opulent Art Nouveau interior from 1900 situated on the first and second floors. The ground floor island-style bar with its quality fittings only dates from the 1980s. Built 1827-8 probably as part of the Argyll Arcade in 1827-8 by John Baird, this is a three-storey tenement-style building. The interior was remodelled in 1900 by Charles Robinson, who specialised in ornate bar interiors. He was commissioned by David Sloan, a prominent Glasgow publican of the era. Known then as the Arcade Caf\u00e9, it was described at the time as 'consisted of richly furnished dining rooms, coffee rooms and bars, in addition to a \"cigar and tobacco divan\" to which businessmen could retire'. \r\n\r\nThere are two entrances \u2013 from Argyll Street there is what looks like a tunnel under a building called Cranston House leading to the pub set back on the right. A small flight of terrazzo steps has \u2018Sloan\u2019s\u2019 on one and \u2018Lounge Bar\u2019 on another. However head for Argyle Arcade to find what Historic Scotland describes as a tiled entrance \u2018of exceptional quality\u2019. It has a segmental-arched columned timber entrance with deeply recessed glazed timber two-leaf doors leading to marble staircase. The walls of the highly decorative passageway into the pub are completely covered in tiling \u2013 a dado of blue, green, yellow and brown patterned tiles with regularly spaced floriate tiled columns and cream tiles above. At the top of the stairs is a lobby with a mosaic floor having leaf symbols. \r\n\r\nThe ground floor originally consisted of a main bar with a large mahogany circular counter with three booths and ample seating accommodation. The island gantry included spirit casks and a leaded glass canopy attached to the ceiling ran around the top of the counter. Research has identified that these fittings were in place up to the 1980s. Also, there was a small cocktail bar on the ground floor. Nowadays, the ground floor bar has a wood laminate floor, an island-style servery with a U-shaped counter front that is panelled in the same style as that on the wall panelling with a mirror panel at the top all the way around. The island gantry has square columns topped with capitals holding up the top section, which has semi circular pediments at the top on both sides. Less than half of the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. Around the walls are seating bays \u2013 two on the left and three on the right, The bays have bench ends incorporating newell posts but whilst quality work all of it only dates from the 1980s. The oldest fittings are the etched panels in the toilets doors. There are doorways lined with similar panelling leading to another smaller room at the rear. It has 1980s panelling and fixed seating also a \u2018Turners Brewery Pale Ale Ayr\u2019 mirror on the far wall. This presumably is where the original cocktail bar was situated. \r\n\r\nOn the Argyll Arcade end of the ground floor bar there is an ornate arcaded glazed timber screen with etched glass and a two-leaf door leads to impressive panelled stairwell. There is an ornate heavy dark timber staircase to the upper floors with decorative newel posts and a large wall painting at first floor landing. At the top of the impressive staircase on the first floor there is the former cash office. There is an impressive corridor consisting of arcaded glazed timber screens with etched glass, Art Nouveau stained glass windows at the top, strapwork plasterwork to ceiling picked out in gold, and rooms leading off. To left of corridor a two leaf door leads to the large dining room with a panelled dado and bell pushes, deep frieze to cornice with low relief plasterwork with putti. More strapwork plasterwork to ceiling. Note one door has \u2018Powder Room\u2019 on it. Further down the corridor on the left is a ladies toilet in what was originally a small dining room. The former Smoking Room at the rear left has a panelled dado, deep frieze to cornice with low relief plasterwork with putti. More strapwork plasterwork to ceiling which with the frieze is painted a deep green colour and detail picked out in gold. There is an ornate wood surround chimneypiece with overmantle mirror almost reaching the ceiling. On the right of the corridor a two-leaf door leads to the former Ladies Dining Room is now a small bar with strapwork plasterwork to ceiling picked out in gold but modern seating. On the wall is a \u2018Campbell & Co\u2019s Edinburgh Ales\u2019 mirror. What was the original ladies toilet is now a store room. Another former small dining room has been amalgamated with the lift service room and is now a kitchen with no old fittings surviving. At the far end of the corridor on the right what was a bar is now an office and the bar removed. (Various other small rooms still exist but they now have alternate uses.) Note there are letters above the doors \u2013 \u2018C\u2019 on the Dining Room, \u2018F\u2019 on what is now the bar, \u2018D\u2019 on a cloakroom, and \u2018E\u2019 on the smoking room. \r\n\r\nOn the second floor on the left is a stuning large ballroom with a vaulted coffered ceiling with detail picked out in gold, a number of small skylights, and stained glass exterior windows with a wreath motif. It has a parquet floor, and on the wall are timber dado supports and regularly spaced pilasters with plaster heads painted gold. All around the room there is a deep cornice with open pediments, egg and dart moulding and festoons with detail painted gold. At the south end of the room is a classical marble chimneypiece with horseshoe tiled insert, overmantle mirror, and above a broken pediment. At the north end is a bar behind shutters but as the right hand part has a different dado the bar may be a later insertion. Modernised toilets on second floor. Its listed category was changed from B to A in November 1996 and the listing descriptions states \u201cSloans is a rare example of a bar, dining room and coffee house complex with an exceptional opulent Art Nouveau interior. The upper floors contain dining rooms, smoking rooms and an impressive ballroom. The tiled entrance from the Argyll Arcade is of exceptional quality. Also of particular note is the quality of the timberwork, such as the arcaded glazed screens and impressive staircase. The decorative plasterwork is of some quality and completes the rich decorative scheme.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs the quality interior-work is situated on the first and second floors visitors are recommended to ring ahead to ensure the rooms can be visited (or to pre-arrange a guided tour). \r\n\r\nVery helpful research including a first floor plan and old photos from John Gorevan, author of Glasgow\u2019s Pubs and Publicans (2002) Tempus Publishing ISBN 9780752427591 to whom we are most grateful.

        "Pub Name": "Bleeding Wolf",
        "Address": "121 Congleton Road North, Scholar Green, ST7 3BQ",
        "Description": "The Bleeding Wolf, built in 1936, is among the greatest surviving interwar pubs. It is one of three similarly constructed \u2018roadhouse\u2019 pubs built in the mid to late 1930s to designs by J H Walters for Robinsons Brewery of Stockport. It is of a Vernacular Revival design and is the only one to retain its thatched roof. The other two are the Legs of Man, Arclid, on the A50; and the Church House Inn, Buglawton near Congleton on the A54 and have since had their thatch replaced by tiles. It retains its original as-built plan-form - a hugely ambitious series of four rustic rooms plus an outdoor department - and most of its original fittings and finishes. The interior is designed in a nostalgic 'publican's rustic' with plentiful use of adzed timber-work.  \r\n\r\nThrough the inner door is the former off-sales hatch still with a sliding two-part stained and leaded window, and openings to rooms right and left. The left-hand doorway originally led into a lobby with the public bar doorway to the immediate left and out-sales to the rear; the left doorway has been blocked and the side walls of the out-sales removed to enable access to both the public bar and saloon bar which did not originally interconnect but the former off-sales hatch still with a sliding two-part stained and leaded window. \r\n\r\nThe left-hand Public Bar has exposed timbering and a stone fireplace framed by cruck-like timbers. It retains an original bar counter and fixed bench seating with adzed woodwork and bell-push panel.  \r\n\r\nThe main Saloon Bar on the right features the servery and an attractive semi-circular bay on the frontage. The counter front is segmental-shaped and has textured lapped boarding (small section on the left is modern as is the bar top). The bar back was, regrettably, altered in 2021, the old shelving being replaced with metal and glass shelves backed by new tiling and mirrors. The impressive inglenook-style brick fireplace has a brick hood over the fire and high backed seating either side with a leaded panel at the top. Some of the leaded glass feature illustrations of the tale of the \u2018bleeding wolf\u2019 (whose legend is told on the walls of the central bar). The middle entrance doorway, which led into the saloon bar, has been blocked to allow more seating space, though the door is retained externally.  \r\n\r\nFurther to the right (at front) is a dining room (originally the Assembly Room) with large 1930s brick fireplace and half-timbering. In 2009 a much wider opening was made in the wall between the dining room and the corridor to the rear, replacing original double doors. A second opening was made in the side wall of the dining room adjacent to the side hatch of the servery counter - the modest opening-up was to make it more visible to diners! A spacious corridor runs across the back of the pub and opens out into a modern extension with doors facing the extensive grounds and there is a hatch to the rear of the bar with a leaded sliding sash screen.  \r\n\r\nTo the rear left is the fine fully-panelled Oak Room (was the Smoke Room) with a 1930s Tudor-shaped stone fireplace with linen fold features in the oak panelling above and bell-pushes all around the room. The double doors have portholes one painted with a wolf. To the right a former living room introduced into pub business as a games room, now houses a carvery. It retains its original brick fireplace but has modern panelling. Beyond that a no-longer\u2013in-use entrance passage has been converted into a disabled toilet. The former recessed two-bay loggia at the rear had been converted into a conservatory but has recently (2021) been further altered and now presents a much tidier appearance.  \r\n\r\nDon't miss the detailing, such as the stained glass Robinson's beer bottles either side of the entrance and coloured glass mug of beer, depictions of the eponymous bleeding wolf, and the original tiling (some of the tiles depict stylised animals or fish on them) in the ladies' and the two gents' toilets, which retain their original urinals.  \r\n\r\nThe pub's unusual name is said to derive from a legend where Adam de Lauton rescued either King John, or alternately the Earl of Chester, from attack by a wounded wolf and in gratitude was granted a thousand acres stretching from Sandbach to Congleton (the Parish of Lauton, later Church Lawton), or as much land as he could walk over in a week. The bleeding wolf was incorporated into the Lawton family coat of arms and the incident was said to have been commemorated at that time by the building of a pub named the 'Inn of the Bleeding Wolf' where the incident occurred.",

        "Pub Name": "Olde Tavern",
        "Address": "22 Victoria Road, Kington, HR5 3BX",
        "Description": "A Victorian pub looking like a house apart from the glass sign over the front door: \"Fred Jones - Wines (Licensed Brewer) Spirits - Ye Olde Tavern\". It remained in the Jones family from 1884 through to 2002 and the pub held one hundred consecutive licences to brew its own beer - the former brewery building at the rear was converted into a bistro in 2002, which is now little used. The Olde Tavern was virtually untouched with three small rooms but in 2002 there were drastic changes to two of them. As the public bar is practically like it was at the end of the 19th century the pub remains one Heritage Pub. \r\n\r\nThe external lobby has bench seating either side, an old brass \"Bass in Bottle\" advert and glass fronted ones for Guinness and Worthington. The internal lobby still retains its serving hatch for off-sales. A latch door on the left leads into the small public bar which is practically unchanged in over 100 years. It has a 19th-century counter, a 19th-century bar-back fitting with pelmet, old tongue & grooved dado panelling, fixed bench seating on rear wall, and bare wall benches around the bay window. \r\n\r\nThe only change appears to be to the fireplace which looks like it has an inter-war brick interior but it retains its older mantelpiece. To the left and right are built in cupboards - the left one is full of historic nick-nacks including an old cask label \"Alfred Jones Brewer Kington Wholesale and Retail All Our Home Brewed Ales Guaranteed Pure, Please Cork, Spile & Return This Cask As Soon As Possible\" - the right one has a display of pewter plates. The till is a traditional one of a block of wood with shallow indentations and is hidden in a cupboard - no modern electronic gadgets here! \r\n\r\nThrough a latch door from the lobby on the right is the smoke room with a flagstone floor, very old tongue-and- grooved half-height panelling with bench seating attached and around the bay window. Service is from a split door to the back of the bar. Prior to 2002 in the right-hand room, there was (and it is still mentioned in the listing description) \"a very tall, curved settle, the back of which forms the right-hand side of the corridor wall\". It was removed to make a very small room larger and the reason given was \"to make the pub more viable\" - you can see the line of where the settle was situated on the floor. \r\n\r\nThrough a latch door to the rear was a little-used, small, third  room which included (according to the listing description) \"a straight settle, the back of which defines the corridor, and fixed wall seating\". These historic fittings were removed and the room converted in 2002 into new inside toilets as the former outside gents' was on land of an adjoining property.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2014. \u2028Converted to a restaurant and therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nA sturdy Victorian hotel of brick with a peacock in relief on the corner, this has a nearly complete and interesting interior. The layout and fittings are mostly original but there seems to have been an inter-war reworking as suggested by the terrazzo floor with its Art Deco-style borders, now covered by carpet, except in the front lobby, and parquet floors. There was a Jug and Bottle Department as indicated by the replacement (transfer?) window over the main door \u2013 this was probably just inside the public bar where the counter protrudes out. The public bar has a fine bar back, supporting arched mirrors and inset tiling which is little changed. The carved bar counter is also good with a curved projection towards the main entrance, carved panels and fluted columns. However, in 2010 a section of almost 5 feet was been removed so it now finishes just short of the hatch serving the rear room and some of the discarded original timber has been crudely re-used to create a door to the servery for staff. The hatch at the rear, which still retains its vertically-sliding window with the wording \u2018Service\u2019 now permanently in the open position, is now a doorway to access the rear room. The original entrance doors would have been on the corner of the building but were changed to windows many years ago, presumably when the partition separating the off sales was removed. 9 of the 14 engraved windows survive some showing a peacock in full display. The windows at the higher level have original coloured glass. \n\nThe former lounge on the left has a metal fireplace which does not look old and retains all 4 engraved windows. Originally there would have been a hatch to the bar but this was opened out in the 1960s and an ugly period counter installed. Removed in 2010, there is a modern equivalent of the hatch and the wide doorway where the counter stood now leads into the former office, which has a parquet floor and is set up for serving buffets. The side entrance leads into the former hotel reception area with full height inner screen with double doors and stained and two leaded panels: it looks as though the glazed reception desk may be an insertion: at any rate it is of the same date as the floor whose patterned shape follows its plan. The large, former plain games room at the rear, original two small rooms, (which did house a full-size snooker table \u2013 sold by the new private owners in 2010) is a restaurant with parquet floor and retains 3 of the 5 engraved windows. Gents toilets have lost their original urinals. Imposing staircase leading to the former guest bedrooms and a long, large function room: this has it's own servery which includes what may be inter-war work, such as the white marble top and glazed cabinet in the bar-back. (Function room not inspected).",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nProminent three-storey early Victorian locals' pub with a former brew house at the rear. The interior consists of two long parallel rooms - public bar on the right and smoke room on the left - with a rear corridor forming a third drinking area and served via a hatch. This layout was created under plans of 1924. The decorative scheme created then survives virtually intact including a most remarkable feature - faux-timber wall panelling topped by a frieze. The central entrance leads to a small lobby lined in match-boarding and a blocked-up jug-and-bottle hatch (the space behind is now a small kitchen). The door on the right has an etched 'Bar' etched in the glass. The public bar has a panelled timber bar and mahogany bar-back fitting with moulded cornice from the 1920s. The fixed seating with a baffle by the front door may be Victorian but the fireplace is a replacement. \n\nThe lounge on the left has all the walls lined with faux-timber panelling to high dado height, topped by a frieze of square panels each with a design of hydrangea flowers and foliage. The panels and frieze are likely to be made of Lincrusta. Unfortunately, it was painted white in 2006, but not behind/underneath the fixed seating where it retains its original brown stain. All around the room is elegant fixed upholstered seating dating from the 1920s which is the date of the timber surround of the fireplace, but the brick inset looks more modern. Service from the back of the bar is from a central doorway with shelf and a half-height door upholstered in buttoned leather from the 1920s with a door handle of the same vintage. The doors to both the public bar and smoke room have been chamfered to fit the frame, presumably after subsidence in the front part of the pub - there is a noticeable dip in the lounge. \n\nAt the rear the staircase hall was been turned into a further public drinking area and has a split door with sliding window for service to the bar but the fixed seating here is modern. Both gents' and ladies' toilets are in this area, presumably to replace outside toilets. In the later 19th century philanthropist and locally styled 'King of Spon End', Charles Lilly, a director of the Poor Relief Board during the Spon End Wakes, held court in an upstairs room of the Black Horse Inn. He adjudicated in disputes amongst the locals and was famous for his drinking challenges - a sport at which he was rarely beaten. Open from 8.30am including Sundays.",

It has a wide opening in the middle to allow staff easy access from one side to the other. Originally the servery linked up to the back wall, but a customer walkway has been created in recent times. \r\n\r\nAnother significant survival, opposite the entrance, is the now-disused tiny jug bar (or if you prefer the version of some regulars, specially built as the \u2018priests\u2019 hole\u2019 where clergy could sneak in undetected for a tipple \u2013 so are pub myths born!). A corridor leads to a large, fairly plain lounge. This, like the rest of the Railway, has wooden dado panelling. On the way there, the gents\u2019 offers a rather splendid and unusual marble urinal, plus old wall- and floor-tiling. Listed in 2008 as a result of survey work by CAMRA. Food consists of rolls.",

        "Description": "An old single-storey pub with possibly the most intact Glasgow-style island bar interior. It has one of the few remaining 'family departments' (off-sales) in the city and two small sitting rooms on the left. The left-hand door has a vestibule entrance with doors to the left and right, where a partition creates a separate bar at the front of the pub. The original carved island gantry still has two old till drawers, one of which retains the small lead containers for coins. The original island counter has a Formica top placed over the original. \r\n\r\nThe right-hand exterior door leads into the intact family department, formed by two part-glazed partition. The only other way to enter this tiny room is via the very rare 90cm (3 feet) high door at the rear of the bar, originally for cleaning staff to access it without going outside. The dado is panelled throughout, and there are two tiled fireplaces in the bar area and another in the front sitting room, which are difficult to date - they are either just pre- or post-war. \r\n\r\nThe sitting rooms with numbers '2' and '3' above them have old bell-pushes and there are no signs the rooms ever had doors. The inside toilets were added in the 1950s and, as the old bell-box on the wall with three windows indicates, there was almost certainly a third sitting room, which is where the ladies' toilet now is. The floor throughout is probably a piece of 1960s work made up of small tile pieces. The original Art Nouveau etched windows have been replaced.",

        "Address": "Peggs Lane, Old Lea, High Offley, ST20 0NG",
        "Description": "Users of the canal system in the early 19th century were well supplied with pubs - this is one of them with the Shropshire Union Canal passing right by the front lawn (and for those travelling by boat it is near Bridge 42). It is probably the most unspoilt remaining example we have left of a genuine canalside pub i.e. built c.1830 (and formed part of a smallholding) for canal traffic so it has a front door that faces the canal, not a road. It has been in the same family since 1903. The history of the family, and the pub, appears in a framed article from the Shropshire Star (March 2009) on the wall.\n\r\nThere are two rooms and it is the right-hand one that is the reason for inclusion in this list. The very small room has a red quarry-tiled floor which is partly 19th-century and partly modern. There are a couple of fine old high-backed settles, one creates a passageway from the front door to the servery; the other is curved with cupboards and drawers. The fireplace is a mid-20th-century replacement; the basic seating around the bay window and scrubbed top tables add to the unspoilt atmosphere.\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Clent, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West Wales;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside; and  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;\n\r\nUntil the 1960s one stood at the top of the steps to the cellar to be served. In about the early 1960s the family built and installed a bar counter, which is decorated to look like a narrow boat. This still is one of few pubs left in the country where the draught beer is fetched from the downstairs cellar and served by a plastic jug, but nowadays only by request to Elaine, daughter of licensee Olive Cliff, who now serves the Wadworth's 6X by the handpump but does top it up using a plastic jug! Other Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Barley Mow, Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire; Holly Bush, Makeney, Derbyshire; Star, Bath, Somerset; Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, West Wales Falcon, Arncliffe, North Yorkshire; and Cresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales.\n\r\nThe left-hand bar was refitted in 1960s when a large picture window was cut into the wall and a small mock Tudor bar counter added. The basic bench seating around the bay window is old, but the fireplace is a 1960s replacement. The guest book has testimonials from Ozzy Osbourne, actress Penelope Keith and actor Tony Briton. The only food served is sandwiches and toasties. The pub has won awards for the large floral displays created by Elaine. In the outbuildings there is a canal craft shop which is open whenever the pub is. Outside gents' and ladies'. The Caravan Club-approved field attached to the pub welcomes both caravans and campers - the Anchor was awarded 'Best Public House CC' in 2008. Please note that from the end of September to Easter the pub is only open on Fri evening, Sat lunch and evening plus Sun lunch but best to ring before a visit.",

        "Description": "A three-roomed pub with a public bar dated 1915 and two lounge bars, one of which is a rare Art Deco survivor. Situated at the foot of a three-storey tenement, it has the metal windows that are typical inter-war work: those on the corner include a plough motif in stained glass, as this was the old name of the pub. The public bar has been amalgamated with a tiny snug on the right by the removal of a short partition. On the back of one of the pots that decorate the inglenook-style fireplace is written 'H & F Thomson Architect', 'Alex Fair Wood Carver', 'John Scott Joiner' and 'Mr Stewart Licence Holder 18th October 1915'. The back gantry with bevelled mirror panels could also date from 1915: the oblong panels and top have been added in recent years, while the counter and wall-panelling seem relatively modern. \r\n\r\nOn the right is a lounge with sleek inter-war panelled walls with brass bell-pushes all around. However, the counter was added post-war, the top replaced in the 1990s while the fireplace has some new tiles. The real star at this pub is on the left with a separate entrance in Moncur Crescent. This is a second lounge which retains its 1930s Art Deco panelled walls, brass-stepped quarter-circle bar counter front and back gantry, fireplace, fixed seating and even the tables. This Sporting Memories Lounge is only open Friday nights, on Saturday or by prior appointment.\r\n\r\nOther  surviving Art Deco interiors can be found at these Heritage Pubs Three Pigeons, Halifax, West Yorkshire; Vale Hotel, Arnold, Nottinghamshire; Test Match, West Bridgeford, Nottinghamshire; Duke (of York), Bloomsbury, London WC1; Portland Arms, Glasgow; and Steps Bar, Glasgow.",

        "Pub Name": "Bear Inn",
        "Address": "3 Market Place, Faversham, ME13 7AG",
        "Description": "A pub with a very long history in an even older building which contains work from, probably, the early sixteenth century. The frontage was rebuilt after a fire in c.1906 and it has been little altered since. A wood-panelled corridor on the left leads to the rear of the building: parallel to it, on the right, is a servery, and, in between, a series of three rooms.\r\n\r\nPlans on the wall of the snug by Faversham architects E. Pover & Son show that in 1906 the layout of a public bar at the front, tiny off sales, and two rooms at the rear described as \u2018Club Room\u2019 were changed. The partition creating the off-sales was removed \u2013 hence the sealed up second entrance door along the left hand passage. The first part of the former club room was converted into a new much larger \u2018Bottle & Jug\u2019, now called the snug, and the rear club room into a \u2018Private Bar\u2019; also the present bar back fitting and counter were installed. \r\n\r\nAt the front through twin doors with Victorian painted glass is the public bar with a quadrant-shaped counter, matchboard panelling to the walls, and a ceiling of diagonally-boarded panels. The public bar has seen some later changes likely to be in post-war times, possibly mid to late 1960s \u2013 an old photo on the wall shows the bar back fitting originally had two bays - confirmed by the plans on the wall of the snug \u2013 one bay was taken out, the counter cut short and moved back to increase the space for customers, and panelling facing the entrance placed in front of more panelling to cover up the changes! The front windows retain original (or accurate replacements for smashed original?) panels \u2018Ales\u2019 and \u2018Spirits\u2019 but the plans on the wall of the passage show the centre window was inscribed \u2018The Bear\u2019 (now replaced by one saying \u2018Wines &\u2019). \r\n\r\nBetween the front bar and the snug further on is a stair to the living quarters. The snug is formed by a three-quarter-height timber and glass screen held in position by an iron rod fixed to a beam. Note the three-feet-high door in the panelling used by cleaners, but now locked in place. Thankfully, only one section of lower bar back shelving has been lost to the ubiquitous fridge with other fridges sensibly placed under the counter. \r\n\r\nThe small private bar and the snug have a matchboard panelled bar counter and an interesting low bar-back with a frieze of roses and swags, and there is a wall painting above. A 1906 drawing of the bar fittings shows that in the lower part of right hand side public bar part of the back fitting drawers and a cupboard have been replaced by a fridge. Then in 2011 a replica cupboard was placed in the bar back fitting matching the original one in the centre. The 1960s false ceiling with fake beams in the private bar was removed in the 2011 refurbishment. \r\n\r\nBeyond is a larger room which has taken in what was the living room since the early twentieth century and the position of fixed seating between the private bar and the rear room makes it still have the feel of two separate rooms. When in possibly the mid to late 1960s the rear room became a public room it had plaster and wood effect on the walls and in 2011 this was removed to expose old panelling. The sensitive refurbishment in 2011 also saw the door at the end of the servery (which was redundant when the former living room became another pub room) removed and repositioned to the rear door in the passage so now all the entrance doors to the public rooms have the same Victorian colourful painted and leaded glass panels in them.",

The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place.\n\nVirtually unaltered in over forty years and still with its jug bar, this is a basic working man's pub which opens at 9am Monday to Saturday. Situated at the bottom of a four-storey tenement building. The public bar retains its 1890s four-bay gantry and counter with a heating rail around the base. There is extensive wall-panelling and on the left wall is an massive 'Dryborough's Pale & Mild Ales' mirror, which is protected with cardboard for Hibernian home football matches when the pub gets packed. \n\nThe tiny jug and bottle compartment on the right, created by a low glazed partition with a hatch for service and small shelf, is a tremendous survival. Where the bar counter ends, there is an arch and the public bar opens out, but all the evidence points to the existing layout having always been like this. At the rear is the small Safari Lounge, refitted in the 1960s, complete with counter, gantry and half ply-panelled walls. However, this may be lost under plans for new toilets and the extension of the drinking area to the rear. \n\nAcross the road the Artisan has a unique Urquhart's mirror which has the corner missing due to its position under a flight of stairs. the pub is also of the island-bar style with a modern gantry and counter.",

        "Pub Name": "Coach & Horses",
        "Address": "29 Greek Street, London, Soho, W1D 5DH",
        "Description": "A four storey building of rendered brick dated around 1840 (the pub itself announces a date of 1847, although the basis for this is not clear). At the end of the C19, during the London \u2018pub boom\u2019 years, the freehold was held by the Cannon Brewery and as part of their remodelling in 1889 the frontage was redesigned and a row of twelve slender, fluted, cast-iron columns with enriched ornamental necks and substantial square capitals were added on both street fa\u00e7ades supporting the upper floors. In 1930 Cannon Brewery was taken over by Taylor, Walker & Co., who in 1937 carried out a refit of the interior and this work survives largely intact. \r\n\r\nThe pub has three separate bars each originally with its own entrance - Public Bar on the Greek Street side; Private Bar in the middle; and Saloon Bar with its entrance on the Romilly Street side. The Saloon Bar has both a double door on the left-hand of the Greek Street end and a single door on the corner so it is possible that there was an off sales in the past? Or they may be original Victorian entrances and this bar has only been a single space since the inter-war refit? \r\n\r\nThe rooms are divided by walls with interwar panelling to two-thirds height and with double doors. The doors for the central partition screens were removed in around 1960 and appear to have been reused in the entrance screen to the women\u2019s WC (built in line with post-war licensing requirements). It is now easy to move between all three bars but the original three-roomed layout still remains. There were some interwar windows advertising \u2018Wines & Spirits\u2019 in red on frosted glass and \u2018Luncheons\u2019 on Romilly Street side but they have been replaced by toughened glass panels in recent years. \r\n\r\nThe interior is fitted-out with simple light-oak interwar panelling. The three bars have tapered wooden bar counters with a linoleum inlay to the top from 1937 as is date of the bar-back shelving. The top section of the right-hand part of the bar back, which straddles the doorway leading to the first floor, has back-lit signage advertising \u2018Double Diamond\u2019, \u2018Ind Coope\u2019 and \u2018Skol Lager\u2019 which looks to have been integrated about 1962. Taylor, Walker & Co were taken-over by Ind Coope in 1959, the same year Skol was launched; also, Draught Double Diamond was introduced in 1962. This part of the bar back with its glass shelves looks different to the smaller one to the left. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the subtle differences between each room reflecting the status of the clientele that used it. The left-hand Public Bar has an overhanging counter top, which, combined with the tapered counter and the lack of a spittoon trough here, appears to have been designed to accommodate bar stools at this corner of the servery. The middle Private Bar has a spittoon trough between the wooden frontage and the carpet, and the counter top is narrower than that in the first room. At the base of the bar counter the terrazzo trough continues from the adjacent saloon bar. \r\n\r\nDrinking at the bar was generally discouraged in the smarter bar rooms in the 1930s and, correspondingly, the right-hand Saloon Bar has a much narrower counter top and a substantial terrazzo trough that runs around the corner at the base (this with unusual (unique?) removable panels with ring-pulls for ease of cleaning). An additional degree of comfort is afforded in the saloon by the original brick fireplace at the north side of the room and meals could be sent down via a dumbwaiter, which is integrated within the panelling to the east wall. \r\n\r\nThe doors to the toilets have narrow oak doors but both gents and ladies\u2019 have modern tiled walls and modern fittings \u2013 it is possible they have been changed around in recent years?  \r\n\r\nThe upper floors appear to have never been intended for public use (at least the awkward route through the bar servery strongly implies it was a later change). On the first floor on the Greek Street side is a dining/function room formed of two originally distinct domestic rooms. Several features from around 1840 are retained including a fitted cupboard, a decorative plaster cornice and two simple, moulded fire surrounds with cheek tiles and cast-iron insets. \r\n\r\nOn the curved Inn sign over the first and second floors it states \u201cNorman\u2019s\u201d as the pub was run by Norman Balon, the self proclaimed \u2018Rudest landlord In London\u2019. He left the pub in 2006 aged 79 and was likely to be the main reason why the pub\u2019s interior is so little changed. There was no juke box or piped music but the day the tenants that followed Mr Balon left the pub a contractor for Fullers was knocking on the door to install background music. \r\n\r\nSome information from \u2018You\u2019re Barred You Bastards: The Memoirs of a Soho Publican Hardcover\u2019 (1991) by Norman Balon (Author) and Spencer Bright (Collaborator) ISBN: 9780283997624. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following details come from an article by Christopher Howse that appeared in The Telegraph dated 23 May 2006. \r\n\r\n\u2018For 40 years, Private Eye has held its fortnightly lunches for informants and prominent people in a chill room upstairs once described as \"a National Health side-ward decorated from Army surplus stores\". Richard Ingrams, co-founder and second editor of the satirical magazine, William Rushton and Peter Cook and the rest came over the road for lunch each day. Norman soon figured as \"Monty Balon, the genial meinhost\" in the magazine. In turn, Mr Balon invented Jeffrey Bernard, who used the pub as an office and had a supply of Senior Service cigarettes kept for him in the cupboard by the stairs. Immortality came in 1989 with Keith Waterhouse's play Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell, a sell-out with Peter O'Toole in title role and the pub interior as the set. Mr Balon would refer to it as \"My play\". \r\n\r\nNorman Balon\u2019s father took on the tenancy on Feb 3, 1943, a noisy time in London. Norman, just turned 16, left school to help. They sheltered in the cellar during air raids. The top-floor room where young Norman slept was in recent years used as a studio, first by Richard Ingrams's son, Fred, then by the successful painter Rupert Shrive. Painters always drank in the pub: Francis Bacon sometimes, Lucian Freud generously, Frank Auerbach intently in conversation with Bruce Bernard, a writer about painting.\u2019",

        "Description": "Rebuilt in 1930 by Mann, Crossman & Paulin, and, despite major alterations in early 2017, the sense of the original layout along with a good deal of the fittings survives. Each of the external doors led to separate rooms, with that in the centre accessing a former small private bar whose position can be seen inside in terms of floorboards set at right-angles to the prevailing pattern. In the original arrangements, to the left was the public bar, behind which was a further room, but this is now occupied by a kitchen (with a gaping opening). To the right were two other rooms, divided by a surviving wooden partition: there were double doors between the two but these have long gone.  \r\n\r\nMost of the extensive 1930s panelling survives and you can spot the diference between the left and right sides. The left-hand bar area was originally the public bar and has simple vertical panelling. The right-hand part was the 'better' side of the pub and has fielded panelling. The treatment of the counter front is similarly differentiated.  Note the 1930s tiling at the foot of the counter (again different treatment between left and right).  \r\n\r\nThe 2017 changes changed the colour tone of the place with the brown woodwork being changed to olive green on the panelling and turquoise on the counters. 2017 also saw the loss of a publican's office at the back of the servery and the refitting of the toilets.",

It is further embellished with a pretty vine-leaf cornice and plaster emblems above the panelling showing the emblems of the UK countries plus a fleur-de-lys. Many features seem original: dimpled glass in the windows, counters, fireplaces, and bar-backs with illuminated 'Charrington\u2019s Ales' signage in both rooms. As for the nickname, various explanations are offered, the most plausible being that the local stable boys who frequented it were known as \u2018rats\u2019.

In 2017 a refurbishment has had a significant effect on the historic feel of the interior leaving the snug at the rear left as the main reason for inclusion here. \r\n\r\nThe Thirties scheme largely kept faith with the previous layout of public bar, smoke room and central corridor with hatch, at the same time incorporating the back bar parlour and dispensing with an old off-sales. This layout survives today, including the corridor, the boarded ceilings, the smoke room on the left (now called the restaurant), and bar parlour (now called the snug). A further room at the rear right has been added from a former living room. \r\n\r\nThe lobby has a dado of 1930s tiling all around it and the original cast-iron exterior gates survive. The door on the right leads to the public bar where the bar fittings were of no great age but the replacement ones are a very modern bar back and rough hewn timber bar counter. The old fixed seating has been removed and replaced by narrow booths created by short modern partitions with space for just two stools, and there is some high fixed seating on the right. \r\n\r\nThe left hand door from the lobby has been out of use for some years. The door ahead leads into a passage that runs to the rear and there are signs of an off-sales on the right. A door on the left of the passage leads to the former smoke room (now the restaurant) which retains its 1930s fixed seating re-leatheretted, some old dado paneling painted a deep red, but it has a new brick and wood surround fireplace. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the passage a door on the right leads to a corridor running along the rear and here is the snug formed by two very old settles, also old dado paneling with wall benches attached \u2013 all painted black. There is a 1930s brick fireplace with a wood surround (no fire) where the brick and walls above the paneling are painted a gastro-green colour. In modern times a hatch has been cut in the wall to the back of the servery. The small room on the rear right accessed via a doorway from the rear corridor and a door from the public bar has some dado paneling (age?) painted turquioise but no old fittings.",

The main bar at the front of the building has an old bar counter and back gantry. On the front left is a tiny area but there is no indication it was ever a separate small snug. In the early 1960s, the rooms at the front were partially opened-up and a second counter added at the rear right. A couple of small rooms have also been brought into use. This quirky pub sells its own blended whisky and over 200 single malt whiskies; it even has a champagne menu. When not busy, drinks are occasionally served on a tray with some complimentary peanuts - the prices reflect this.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nIncluded here for the highly unusual serving arrangements - there is no bar counter. \n\nLarge, grey-rendered building on the eastern side of the main street, with a date-stone of 1753 above the door and the only 'inn sign' is the wording 'Kings Head Hotel' painted on the front. Entry is through a large, round-headed glazed door. A room to the right has the remnants of fitted seating, much altered and repaired. A corridor to the left gives access to the pub\u2019s private accommodation. It also gives access to a room which is a \u2018bar\u2019 in its original sense \u2013 a private room for the publican, from which drinks are served and in which cash and other valuables are kept. This contains hand-pumps (not in use), keg taps, bottles and the till, and is a very rare survival. \n\nThe rear of the building, which was originally two rooms with a passageway in between, was knocked into one in 1995: no features or furnishings of interest survive. Practically all the drinks are served to your table, although you can stand in the doorway of the 'bar' room if you want to order and collect them. In the small room to the right of the passage, originally the most popular room, there is a bell on a rope which you can pull to attract the attention of bar staff. Most of the customers are now to be found in the rear room where you may see them tapping coins on their glasses when they want a refill! Opens at 4 Mon to Thu; 3 Fri, 12 Sat, Sun.",

        "Description": "The exterior of this inner London pub belies the riches within. Much has changed since around 1900 when it was refitted but the wall tiling is a very special survival. It is by W. B. Simpson and Sons who tiled many a London pub. The star feature is the right-hand wall which lined a former corridor (the floor footprint can still be easily seen).There are blue and white tiles with pairs of birds and swirling Arabesque patterns but near the entrance is a vast tile panel depicting the legend of Arion whose misfortune in being thrown overboard by avaricious sailors and then saved by a friendly dolphin is narrated in an inscription.  \r\n\r\nOn the other side of the pub an entrance panel depicts Diana the Huntress; then come more blue and white bird-and-foliage panels.  \r\n\r\nOther magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Caf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; General Havelock, Hastings, Sussex, East; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; St James Tavern, Soho, London W1; and Golden Cross, Cardiff, X Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nAs for the other fittings, the counter is largely of c.1900, as is the central stillion. There is a separate room at the rear-left although its panelling seems modern. Other remaining screenwork shows how the front part of the pub would have been divided into separate drinking spaces.",

        "Address": "4 Hackins Hey, Liverpool, City Centre, L2 2AW",
        "Description": "Tucked away off Dale Street, this pub retains much from an inter-war refit and has a rare first floor cellar. One reason suggested for the unusual cellar is that the pub was built on consecrated land - a cemetery for a Quaker Meeting House. Until recently, some real ale was served from a keg looking dispenser by gravity feed down the columns on top of the bar counter but the pipework has not been replaced recently so all real ales now served on handpumps. Look for the framed note titled 'Gravity Fed Traditional Ales'. \r\n\r\nLeaded screens form seating areas and while the lower parts of these and the wall panelling are from the 1930s, the upper parts were restored/replaced in c.1984. The lower parts of the bar-back fitting look to be original 1930s work but the top section is modern. Note the marble counter top in one area from the days of serving food from it. The counter front of copper panels could be from the 1960s and the ornate copper fireplace hood could date from that time. Note the telephone booth with a door covered with studded leather \u2013 from the days before mobile phones! \r\n\r\nLook for the three window bell-box still situated behind the bar - the bell pushes are still in working order but rarely switched on due to both accidental and purposeful over use of them! It claims to be the last 'Men Only' public bar in Liverpool only allowing women in when forced to by law on 1 January 1976 when the Sex Discrimination Act (1975) became law! This is the reason why the present ladies' toilet can only be accessed by walking across the servery and going upstairs to the former staff toilet on the first floor! The gents' are little altered with an interwar terrazzo floor and dado.",

        "Description": "The two-storey brick and flint frontage part that forms the majority of the pub is from c.1900 but the right-hand part of the building of single-storey with attics is much older and it is only this small part that is statutory listed along with the row of cottages. There used to be an off-sales which was accessed from a central front door but is now incorporated into the public bar. The pub was subject to an expansion and refurbishment in around 2012.  \r\n\r\nFrom the front door there is a passage with red, black and cream tiled floor with most laid diagonally. The old dado panelling is painted a dull green colour and the door to the servery has a shelf and hatch. Note the unusual hinged wooden \u2018shutter\u2019 that can cover the door from the inside with a hole for the knob.  \r\n\r\nOn the left is the narrow front snug with an interwar canted bar counter recently painted a dull green colour, some of the bar shelving may be old, old match-board dado panelling with benches attached. On the left with an entrance on the side of the building is the small public bar with a parquet floor, a wood surround, tiled & cast iron fireplace that dates back to c.1900, old match-board dado panelling but the quarter circle bar counter looks post-war. The two bars were separate but linked together in c.2012 and the snug now acts as more of a passage to reach the public bar rather than a separate room to drink in.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear are two rooms probably brought into pub use in the interwar years as both have 1930s brick fireplaces The one on the right has interwar dado panelling but the bar counter is a recent replacement and a fielded panelled screen in this room has been removed. The rear left room has a quarter circle counter, now used as a reception and all wooden surfaces in both rooms have been painted a dull green colour. The extension at the rear houses new toilets to replace the outside ones.  \r\n\r\nThere is a room on the right of the passage that was originally two rooms of the cottage. It has some carpets on a bare wood floor, an old wood surround painted dull green and brick fireplace (not used) and a post-war brick fireplace with a stove fire in the rear part.",

        "Pub Name": "Stags Head",
        "Address": "45 Fowler Street, South Shields, NE33 1NS",
        "Description": "Built of brick in 1897 (architect unknown) on a narrow, shallow site which accounts for what is a highly unusual feature and the reason why this is one CAMRA's heritage pubs - two bars, one above the other and both have their original counters and bar-backs. Many pubs have upstairs public rooms but with very few exceptions (another is the Bartons Arms, Birmingham) these have been brought into service after the building of the pub and/or do not have historic serveries. The entrance lobby on left-hand side has floor to ceiling tiling in dark green, gold and brown with diamond laid tiles in relief on the dado, light green tiles in relief above, some floral patterned ones in both areas and a tiled frieze at the top. The inner door has a stained glass and leaded panel and door protector. \r\n\r\nThe small public bar has an unusual feature of a wide, four-centered arch which spans the downstairs servery. Within it is the original bar back topped by a modern clock and broken pediments; and a bar counter which has been extended to continue around the corner but closely matches the original work. The room has a vast, Victorian tiled and wood surround fireplace with a stags head at the top, a Ty Paterson\u2019s & Co\u2019s Pale Ales and Stout (Edinburgh) mirror and one \u2018The Stag\u2019s Head\u2019 etched window. The pub was extended backwards in the 1970s into the yard and the outside toilets were removed. This created a larger floor area in the lower bar which is clearly visible. \r\n\r\nThere is a door on the right-hand side of the building which, as indicated in the lamp above it, leads to the lounge bar, a small room up the staircase on the first floor. This entrance from the street was closed off in the 1970s and access is now from a new staircase created as part of the installation of the inside toilets. The small upstairs lounge bar retains its Victorian bar back incorporating turned columns and leaded glass panels, an original bar counter with recessed panels, and a fireplace with substantial wood surround featuring a number of columns, also fixed seating and a frieze. \r\n\r\nHowever, in 1984 the bar fittings were moved. Originally they were situated in the space between the old staircase and the front windows on the right hand side of the room. Now they are situated in the extension at the rear of the room and on a raised platform. Whilst the bar back fits perfectly and therefore does not appear to have been subject to change, the bar counter appears to have been truncated to fit.  \r\n\r\nThe upstairs room is currently only used for functions so if you want to take a look it is recommended you visit the pub at a quiet time and ask if it is possible to go upstairs. Statutorily listed in 2010 following a successful application by CAMRA.",

        "Pub Name": "Bell Inn",
        "Address": "Bell Lane, Aldworth, RG8 9SE",
        "Description": "A great classic rural pub and a winner of many CAMRA awards. It has been in the same family since the 18th century (five generations \u2013 Hunt/MacQuhae/Macauley family names) and its building history goes back much further. It started as a cruck-framed hall (a cruck can be seen outside on the left in the gents' - of which more anon!), has been much changed over the centuries and now presents an unassuming red-brick face to the world. The approach is via a sun-trap veranda with red quarry-tiled floor and seating either side. There are two public rooms, located either side of a red quarry-tiled passage from the front door.\r\n\r\nThe tap room on the left, the reason for inclusion on the National Inventory, has a figure \u20184\u2019 over the doorway, a red quarry-tiled floor, a gigantic inglenook fireplace with a fine fire-back dated 1650 (not original to the pub), three scrubbed top tables, brown-painted panelling, fixed benches round three sides, assorted basic benches, a one-handed clock and, at the rear, a timber and glass partition to the corridor leading to the living quarters. Note the shove ha\u2019penny, ready to play. Most of the tables and benches date from the nineteenth century and were made in the village blacksmith's/carpenter's shop which was in the hands as the same family as the pub: they are said to have been installed by the present landlady's great-grandmother: she also installed the screen to the long corridor. Prior to the servery being installed, pot boys used to fetch the beer from the cellar in jugs and serve it in the left-hand room.\r\n\r\nRight of the corridor and extending into the right-hand room is the servery which has sliding glass partitioning, on two sides and hatches for service \u2013 one of only a handful of such serving arrangements left in the UK. It is said to have been put in the 1930s but may be earlier. The bar shelving dates from c.1930. Note the figure \u20181\u2019 over doorway to the public bar and \u20182\u2019 over the door to the servery. The set of ebony handpumps bear the date of 1902. Note the ancient till and one of the remaining bowls for coins.\r\n\r\nA doorway leads into the right-hand bar, now an L-shaped room, which was formed in 1974, when the present licensees took over, taking out a partition beneath the beam: this bears the number '3' which clearly shows the back part of the room was separate, although was barely used. At this time on the right-hand side the couple of recesses - formerly ovens - were opened-up. The front section has lino floor, hatch to the servery, ancient panelling with bench seating. The rear section of the room has its own hatch which is still raised daily and locked into place by bolts. There is a considerable amount of old panelling (full height on one wall), a wall-mounted corner cupboard and a brick fireplace with log burner. Look for the hinges on the window cill on the right-hand side of the rear section \u2013 this was used for off-sales! \u2013 now secured down.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh yes, the gents' loo - outside on the left, and known, for obvious reasons after a few beers on a dark evening, as the 'Planetarium'! It was added in 1933, when mains water was installed (?).\r\n\r\nOn 19 September 1978 one hundred regulars from the Bell made aviation history by chartering a British Airways Concorde to take them on their annual pub outing. Concorde flew from London Heathrow over the bay of Biscay down to Spain and back \u2013 see the flight details on a certificate on the wall of the pub, and the special Bell Inn \u2018Concord Charter Flight\u2019 envelope.

Also there used to be a tiny snug partitioned off to the right of the entrance. Across the corridor is the former village shop which for a time was a public room with pool table but is now used for storage. At the front of the building is another former bar room (but once domestic accommodation) in use till about 2008 and now also used for storage.

        "Pub Name": "Bruce Arms",
        "Address": "Easton Road, Easton Royal, SN9 5LR",
        "Description": "A traditional rural pub that has little changed with time. Built between 1848 and 1855 by the Salmonach Estate (which owned seven pubs), it was sold to Strong's of Romsey in the 1940s. The name comes from the fact that Thomas, brother of Robert the Bruce, married into the estate owner, Lord Ailesbury's family (part of the Cardigan family of Charge of the Light Brigade fame) and their family crest are the coat of arms on the pub sign. It did brew its own beer and on the mantelpiece is a piece of wood from a cask impressed with the words 'Bruce Arms'. The pub's nickname is 'The Gammon' - there was a pub on the other side of the road called the Gammon of Bacon which burnt to the ground in c.1830 and the Bruce Arms was built as a replacement - note the cartoon on the wall of the public bar about the pub burning down. It was run by the same family between 1919 and 1993 - long-serving landlady, Rose Raisey, lived here 74 years until hee death in 1993 aged 87. \r\n\r\nOn entry is a tiny snug with an old counter and a red and black quarry-tiled floor. There is simple old shelving in the servery near the hatch to the lounge and on the public bar side. There are a couple of bar stools and it is still used by locals. The public bar (right)has a wonderful, timeless feel with a red-brick floor, some splendidly robust and functional carpentry in the form of two long scrubbed tables and low, basic benches. The counter is believed to have been part of a refit in the 1930s, a date which would accord well with the brick fireplace. The ultra-basic shelving in the servery may be a little later. Further right is a room which was formerly Rose's kitchen and had a Rayburn. With settees and armchairs  it looks like someone's front room. Beyond this, is a modern extension dating from 1996 which acts as a games and function room but it does not impact on the historic core. \r\n\r\nLeft of the entrance lobby is the lounge. A plain room said to have long been in pub use, it has a hatch to the servery (no longer in use), a fireplace possibly installed in c.1952 and just two large tables. The piano in the lounge was bought for Rose when she was 13 years old and is still played occasionally. The toilets on the left were added in 1952. Across the road is a cricket pitch owned by the pub but is has not been used since 2005 when the cricket team captain fell out with the pub owners!",

Although Edwardian character was eroded from the pub\u2019s back parts by remodelling in the 1970s, it is beautifully preserved in the front bar - an outstanding room that has all its original wood-panelling and bench seating a fine mahogany bar back-fitting with impressive glazed-towered cupboards and, spectacularly, a rare ceramic-fronted bar-counter (almost identical to the one at Garden Gate, Leeds, by Burmantofts). Only fourteen remain in the whole of the UK and a further such counter from is to be found at another Hull pub, the Polar Bear on Spring Bank. \r\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe entrance lobby too has original doors and floor tiling.

        "Pub Name": "Blue Bell",
        "Address": "53 Fossgate, York, YO1 9TF",
        "Description": "The Blue Bell is a true national treasure. With its perfectly-surviving Edwardian interior, it is one of very few public houses in the whole UK to have the distinction of Grade II-star statutory listing status (upgraded in the 1990s in recognition of its outstanding internal interest). This mid 17th century building has a narrow external frontage with deep pink glazed bricks on the ground floor. The superb 100 year old etched \"Blue Bell\" front window was smashed by vandals in late 1998 and what you now see is a good replacement fitted in early 1999. Compact and intimate, it preserves its 1903 plan of front bar, back smoke room and side corridor with drinking lobby, as well as all the fittings that resulted from its refurbishment that year by a local firm of wine merchants, C J Melrose & Co (then owners of a small chain of five York pubs). Its authentic fittings include engraved and frosted glass in doors and windows, glazed screens with sashed service hatches to the back room and corridor, and varnished and polished matchboarding to the walls and ceilings. \r\n\r\nThe very small public bar at the front has a 'Bar' decoratively engraved and frosted glass panel on the door, a red diamond patterned quarry tiled floor, a 1903 panelled bar counter with a more modern top, various 1903 bar back shelves, some with a mirrored back, and a small bar back fitting on the north side wall. All the walls and the ceiling are covered in varnished and polished matchboarding painted deep red, there is a 1903 cast iron and dark green tiled fireplace, seating consists of a long bench on the front wall side and a small one on the hall side, and there are just two tables - a cast iron based oblong one with a red Formica top and a small round cast iron one with a copper top. \r\n\r\nFrom the front door a passageway, also with its walls and the ceiling covered in varnished and polished matchboarding, runs from the front door to the rear. The inner door, which opens both ways, has a 'Smoke Room' decoratively engraved and frosted glass panel on the door and beyond it a drinking lobby with a hatch counter in a wider area at the front. Around the hatch with its intact two-part sliding screen/window are glass panels - frosted at the lower level and plain at the top. Note the tiny seat usually folded away which is something like the \u2018walking' ones seen at a race meeting. \r\n\r\nThe passage continues to the smoke room at the rear and on the right is another door with a 'Smoke Room' decoratively engraved and frosted glass panel. A glazed screen forms the division between the servery and the rear smoke room and has a two part sliding sashed service hatch and an entrance to the servery for staff with curtains \u2013 very traditional. All the walls and the ceiling of this small room are also covered in varnished and polished matchboarding, there is fixed bench seating on two sides with bell pushes above and a baffle near the door, also an old bench on the north side wall. There is a 1903 cast iron and red tiled fireplace with Art Nouveau decoration and only three small decorative pub tables by A Reynolds & Co, Bar Fitters, Leeds with copper tops. \r\n\r\nThe Blue Bell's preservation in such an unaltered state has had much to do with its tenancy remaining in the in the Robinson family ownership throughout most of the twentieth century. George Robinson, one of the first directors of York City Football Club, took over in 1902 and held private meetings in the Blue Bell which led to the club's formation in 1922. The family succession carried on up to 1992 when the redoubtable Edith Pinder finally retired. Since then it has weathered three major ownership changes but, thanks to enthusiastic and caring licensees, it has managed to thrive. The only food on sale is toasted sandwiches.",

Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nA marvellous rural survival, picturesquely sited by the Bridge of Fiddich. The building dates from 1842 and has been in the hands of the present family since November 1919. The tiny bar is at the end of a cottage and measures a mere 10 ft. x 15 ft. It has a panelled counter running down the length of the room and a gantry which was made by the local carpentry works of A. & R. Dunbar of Popine Mills. The servery takes up almost half the room and there is only space for some bar stools and a few plain benches. \n\nThe record number of people in the pub is said to be 40, achieved one Christmas Day \u2013 some way to go to\nrival the Nutshell in Bury St Edmunds, but at least some of the throng were playing the bagpipes. Behind the bar is a simple gantry with turned shafts and the walls have half-height panelling. There are also mirrors advertising William Younger\u2019s and Robert Younger\u2019s IPA. Listed in 2008 as a result of survey work by CAMRA. \n\nUpdate 2017: The pub is closed following the death of landlord, Joe Brandie, at the grand old age of 88. Future unknown.",

        "Description": "The exterior, with its black and white mosaic and distinctive lettering, prepares us for what is, in its way, one of the most remarkable pub interiors in the UK; a full-blown and now very rare c.1960 remodelling of an island bar-style pub. Not surprisingly for a nation just emerging from post-war austerity, pubs schemes of that time have no grandiose decoration or the sleek elegance of the 1930s and were duly replaced as the 20th century wore on. However, the design style is unmistakable. \r\n\r\nThe entrance from Bridge Street has a small off-sales facing it. On the left comes the public bar with fixed seating round the walls, a series of small, screwed-down, two-tier Formica tables and contemporary low chairs. The boarded elongated oval bar counter (with Formica top) is a fairly simple affair, not unlike work of the 1930s, but the suspended structure over it and the panelling of the ceiling are quintessential 1960s. The lower part of the central gantry appears to be a survivor from the Victorian predecessor pub, as are three cast-iron columns and the floor tiling in the gents'. There's even a c.1960 heated glass food display unit on the counter and still in use today for hot pies and bridies (the pie, peas and gravy is cheap and delicious). The lounge is a smarter place, carpeted unlike the boarded public bar, with more fixed seating, panelling and a number of bell-pushes for table service. To complete the picture the Formica-covered walls in both loos may not exactly strike you as tasteful but they are just as much an historical document as Victorian tiling \u2013 only so much rarer (such work reappears at the Steps Bar in Glassford Street!",

It has none of the glitz and glitter that we associate with great Victorian pubs, nor the suave sleekness of the best interwar work. Yet this is the sort of thing they were putting up in the 1950s and 1960s and, though quite recent, incredibly few complete schemes survive (another example is the Laurieston Bar, Glasgow). Outside, the depressed triangular heads to the windows are redolent of the 1960s. There are two rooms with a servery in between, all with original fittings.

A passage runs down the left hand side of the pub from the front door to the rear and a sliding door leads into the small front bar with fittings dating back to the late 19th century. These include the fine Tudor Revival four sectioned bar-back, where the second one is access for staff to the rear lounge, and it has mirrored panels. There is also a Victorian panelled bar counter which has a top dating from 2005 and an old carved wood surround fireplace with Tudor shaped interior, that has been bricked up, which may well be early twentieth century. Other old fittings are the floor to ceiling wall panelling, a match-boarded ceiling, and a pair of baffles by the door but the benches attached to the walls are difficult to date. \r\n\r\nFurther down the passage is the door to the lounge in an older part of the building which is clearly an amalgamation of a couple of rooms. The ceiling nearest the servery has an old sectioned plasterwork ceiling with a decorative plaster frieze. The bar fittings here are all modern as is the fireplace and fixed seating. The gents toilets at the rear are still 'outside' but the ladies has a covered walkway. The pub boasts the highest sales of Castle Eden Ale (now brewed at Camerons) in the whole of the north east.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2019. \u2028Converted to a Community Hub for East Boro Housing Trust. Some elements of the former pub are apparent but bar/bar back etc all gone and rooms adapted for new use. Re-categorised therefore as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nLarge corner-site pub rebuilt in 1935 by Devenish Brewery of Weymouth. Built of brick with a mock Tudor timber effect on the upper floors, it is situated in the inner suburbs of Weymouth, but which has seen better days. However, it retains its four original rooms. On the corner is a large, basic public bar with a bar-back including pairs of twin columns and a plainly boarded counter with a modern bar top of melamine(?). The bar counter has been shortened by some 3 to 4 feet \u2013 it originally finished at the wall level with the gents\u2019. The piece of counter at an angle to the rest is wholly new work \u2013 note the panels are wider. The bar counter has a modern Formica-type top but is stuck over the original main part. The jug and bottle that was accessed from the door to the right of the double doors on Franklin Road had up to 30 years ago a counter that was accessible by staff when the bar ran all the way along the room. As the only ladies\u2019 toilet when built in 1935 was in the lounge, the jug and bottle was converted into a new ladies toilet with the addition of a new partition wall. In order to get access to the ladies\u2019 the original doorway width gap was expanded into the present wide arch. \n\nTo the right is an off-sales compartment which functioned until as late as 2000 (mainly for confectionery for the local kids) but now used as a store and the counter has been taken out. Beyond this, and announced in the window glass over the entrance, is a lounge and (formerly) private bar (now pool room). The former has been rather abused by padded furnishings and a piece of white plastic looking like a panelled counter front that is stuck onto the original lapped wood counter i.e. it is the same as the Private Bar one; it also has a modern bar top. The private bar has what seems an inter-war Art Deco bar counter front (quadrant-shaped) but another modern bar top. The servery catering for these two rooms has a bar-back in the same style as that in the public bar. There is an oval shaped coloured glass skylight but it has been covered over as are three windows on the curved section of wall. The fireplace here is modern and the gents\u2019 in this area retains its two large original Shanks urinals. \n\nThe left hand side entrance to the pub on Franklin Road has a double door to the large function room, which doubles up as a skittle alley, and can also be accessed from the Public bar. There is a third external door immediately to the right hand of the function room entrance, which is believed to used for the Jug sales, but is now boarded up internally. In the lobby by the function room is a dumb waiter, which is now an electricity cupboard but upstairs it is still complete with working gear, formerly used to service the Billiards room and Freemasons meeting room upstairs. These two rooms have been converted to form Landlords living space. Five letting rooms have been decorated, and in use as such, with separate bathroom and toilet for them all.",

        "Address": "Monkey Lane, Priors Dean, GU32 1DA",
        "Description": "The White Horse is an example of what has been termed 'publican's rustic', a popular form of pub furnishing that first appeared between the wars and uses rough, chunky woodwork; half-timbered effects, rough plasterwork and exposed brick and stone, also consciously rough-hewn furniture - the idea was to create a sense of rural charm and the good old days of yore. This deliberate exercise in nostalgia is enhanced by the dark, discoloured surfaces that look as though they ought to be the subject to a preservation order! \r\n\r\nThe pub originally consisted of the left hand bar which is barely altered in years with a large stone fireplace, now with a modern log burner, and old furniture including a small settle. The bar counter itself does look old but with a mighty split log frontage added in 1962/3. On the wall are two copper-framed pictures with a title in raised lettering entitled \u201cPreparing For A Heavy Stage\u201d and \"A Summer Incident\" showing the supposedly glorious days of coaching. Note the brick inglenook fireplace behind the servery indicating this area was converted from other uses, possibly in the inter-war period. The bar back fitting looks like it is modern rather than old work and there is a small separate low fitting added in recent times.\r\n\r\nThe right hand quarry tiled floor bar looks like it has been there for many years but prior to 1962 it was a shed (the lower area) and a small (higher) area that linked them. The counter with its split log frontage and copper top was added in 1962/3; the brick fireplace looks like 1930s work; some furniture is of great age such as a bench dated 1769 but likely to have come from elsewhere; and there are more of the copper-framed pictures - \u201cBehind Time\"  and \u201cA Fresh Team\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe pub has been greatly expanded since being  taken over by Gales Brewery in the 1990s with a dining room in an extension at the rear which has a brick fireplace with log fire.",

        "Address": "Balls Cross, GU28 9JP",
        "Description": "Behind the stone and brick 18th-century facade lies a four-roomed village pub. The original two main rooms are little altered for over 70 years. In the late 19th/early 20th century the post office cottage dating from 1880 to the right side was added. The fourth room on left-hand side side was the former beer store, becoming the games room in the mid-1990s. The pub was in family ownership until 1966 when it was acquired by King & Barnes and is now owned by Hall & Woodhouse. The main door leads into the public bar with large Horsham flagstones - some 3ft x 4ft but all irregular shapes. Folklore has it that these were laid first, and the building constructed around them!  Old half-height panelling painted a pale green colour. Part of the bar, from the entrance to the bar counter, was a Bottle and Jug until the 1920s. A small indentation in the ceiling running diagonally from left of the door indicating the position of a former partition is the only key to this former layout. Old inglenook fireplace essentially unaltered - a posed photo of a hoop shaver sitting in the inglenook, dated March 1939, confirms. Note the 17th-century fireback. Bar counter most definitely original from 1920/30s. Simple back shelves were, reputedly, fitted when the stillage was done away with and this was believed to be 1950s. Door frame between main bar and small right-hand bar was replaced (old one rotten?) by K&B in 1966 with a varnished oak door-frame as a 'feature'.  A replacement beam above the bar counter was also fitted in 1966 (to strengthen the ceiling?). \r\n\r\nTo the right is the another small bar with original wooden floorboards. Old dado panelling. Quarter-circle bar counter dates from at least 1920/30s as evidenced by a photo from Southern Weekly News dated 9/4/1938 in the bar.  Behind the bar is an old low door, now painted over and out of use. Simple bar back wooden shelving behind again from 1950's. Fireplace in this bar is from 1930s and appears in the 1938 photo - it is now covered by a bench. There is just one large table in this small room and an illuminated display case in the wall. The third room was originally the cottage and was incorporated into the pub late C19th/earlyC20th, being originally used as the games room and converted into a dining area mid-1990s. Local recollection from the 1930s is definite on this point. Original fireplace (from 1800s) and wood panelling from 1920/30s plus original door-frame linking bars 2 and 3. On the front left is the small games room in a former beer store brought into use in the mid-1990s. Clearly done out in sympathetic style with dado wood panelling etc. This totally discrete room it is approached by step and door from main bar - the exterior door is kept locked. The outside gents' on the left has been that forever but the outside ladies' occupies the former garage on the right and dates from the mid-1960s.",

Service is from a couple of small hatches cut into the wall to the cellar; the one on the right was created in 1997 from the door to the servery. In the cellar servery are some very old bar-back shelves and a stillage with casks of beer and poly casks of ciders. Note the old Doulton sink in the front window - its original use is not clear but it is now popular with cyclists for filling up their water bottles! Up half a dozen well worn steps on the left and through a low doorway is the original second room now used by diners. It has a flagstone floor, beamed ceiling and old stone fireplace with a new food counter added in the mid-1990s. A third room on the left has been brought into use in recent years. Outside gents' and ladies' toilets. Closed Sunday evenings and all day Monday (except Bank Holidays).",

Yet this marvellous display was done frugally, using plasterwork as imitation timber. The lavish effect can still be appreciated today although the layout was much altered in the mid-1960s when the former snug and smoke-room were merged and the tap room became the gents\u2019 toilet. There is still a separate dining room with more \u2018wood\u2019 panelling. The revolving entrance door is a noteworthy rarity. \r\n\r\nUPDATE 2017.\r\n\r\nRecently all the wall panelling has been painted a gastro grey colour so our photos are out of date (the bar counter looks to have been spared this treatment).",

They are variously pictured enjoying a game of bowls, drinking and smoking, watching the inn sign being painted, and taking the waters at Kilburn Wells, the spa that lay nearby to the south. There is a deep and superbly ornate Florentine frieze in both main rooms and also a richly decorated ceiling. When built the main space would have been much more subdivided than it is now but there is still one screen surviving: it was moved to its present position during a major refurbishment in 2003, before which it was at right-angles to the main road. Long, panelled bar counter and original bar-back. Fine etched windows on the side elevation but mostly sadly removed from the front.

Such was the amount of pub renovation at the end of the 19th century and since, that any fittings before the late-Victorian era are incredibly rare. Those at the Victoria are stylistically mid-Victorian and a precise date \u2013 1864 \u2013 is suggested by the date on a clock in the bar-back fitting. This, and a side wall, have large mirrors with intricate gilding and coloured decoration, each panel being separated from the others by detached columns with lozenge and Fleur-de-Lys decoration. This may be the oldest surviving bar back in the country, with the other possible contenders being the Kings Head, Bristol dating from c. 1865 and the Red Cow, Richmond\r\n\r\nIn the angle of the building is a delicate Regency-style fireplace containing a print of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their numerous progeny. \r\n\r\nThe counter is no doubt a piece from 1864 with panelled bays divided by fluted pilasters. It still retains a brass water-dispenser for diluting spirits \u2013 still fully functioning. Mounted on the long wall are coloured prints of soldiers in wooden frames but these are most probably a relatively modern (though now smoke-stained) addition. There are several outside doors and these would have led originally to a series of internal drinking areas, separated by screenwork. Upstairs the Theatre Bar has ornate fittings imported from the Gaiety Theatre about 1958.",

On the corner is a spectacular L-shaped bar, substantially unaltered apart from the right-hand end. The highlight here is a magnificent decorative ceramic bar counter by Craven Dunnill of Jackfield in Shropshire with tiles in beige, brown, yellow and green and complex floral decorations in several colours. Only fourteen remain in the whole of the UK and pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s an equally outstanding carved timber bar-back with etched and gilded mirrors and a corner clock. One mirror advertises Cragganmore Finest Liqueur Scotch Whisky but one advertising Clanivor Finest Highland Malt was sadly smashed some years ago and has been removed in recent years. A column runs up from the counter with decorative mirror glass. Unfortunately, the right-hand parts of the counter and bar-back, which were originally an off sales, were vandalised and truncated some years ago to provide a widened entrance on the right to the rear lounge - an entrance which scandalously is now unused! There is a fine vestibule entrance with a leaded dome and etched 'Bar' panels on the door. \r\n\r\n The rear large lounge has been opened-up by removal of a partition in the 1980s and combination of the smoke room, which was the area near the toilets. It has a good mirrored bar-back (which has been shortened) but a modern counter; 'Birmingham Pubs' believe that part of the bar-back was the cut-off bit from the front, but there is doubt about this. A 'blackboard' pub notice states that 'During a recent refurbishment a mural - spanning the entire back wall in the lounge was uncovered. It depicts a Victorian street scene with The Red Lion and Royal Oak visible - date unknown'. The rear lobby on the left-hand Short Heath Road side has remnants of good tiles which must have been more widespread originally. Some of the etched windows have lion illustrations; some have 'crown' motifs - this being an early M&B trademark.",

Some of the glazing is contemporary, including windows on the first floor and the door glass inscribed \u2018Bar\u2019. A change is that there used to be a corridor from the right-hand doorway to the rear. The counter (with unusual strips of low-relief carved decoration) and the bar-back are, no doubt, Edwardian as well. The rear and left hand parts took their present form in 1984.A nine-month closure followed in the early 21st century but it was then rescued and brought back to a vibrant life in March 2005.",

The 100th birthday celebrations lasted three days and the pub was featured on TV. In the past it was quite common for pub-keeping to be combined with some other livelihood but it is rare these days. The small public bar with its red and black quarry-tile floor retains a match-boarded counter, simple shelving behind and a wooden fire-surround, complete with shelving and small turned balusters and a 'Truman, Hanbury & Buxton & Co Burton Ales' mirror above. The only modern item is some leatherette fixed seating from the late 1960s. Note the old opener on the counter that was used for taking corks out of beer bottles. \r\n\r\nWhen built the pub consisted of the public bar and also a smoking room - note a door on the left of the porch - but this other small room became part of the living quarters in the 1960s. At this time the old stables to the right were converted into a large new restaurant-lounge that can hold 100 diners. Accessed through a pair of doors on the right of the bar with a small hatch to the side of the bar for service and ply panelled walls it impacts little on the old bar. It is used for meals on a Saturday evening and also one sitting at 12.30pm for an amazingly good value three-course Sunday roast  lunch for which a booking is essential.\r\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs with working farms attached and run by the licensee or their family members are the Luppitt Inn, Luppitt ; Quiet Woman, Earl Sterndale; Victoria Arms, Worton ; and Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen .",

As well as its expansion for dining, the pub has lost one of its former three drinking rooms, with new toilets replacing the old back tap room, and the front bar has been considerably modified. (The counter, for instance, is less than ten years old).",

        "Description": "17th- or early 18th-century pub. The snug at the Holly Bush is one of Great Britain\u2019s finest unspoilt pub rooms. It is formed by a curved partition wall with windows in the very top part and a double hinged door with \u20182\u2019 on it in the centre of the partition. Attached to the inside of the partition wall are benches which make them look and feel like two high backed curved settles and there is some wall bench seating attached to the dado panelling on the exterior wall side. This small room has a quarry tiled floor, an Excelsior range fireplace (n.b. this was installed from elsewhere in the 1990s). A short passage to the left of the fireplace leads to the back of the servery where there is a stable door (lower half removed). For service the approach to the snug from the front door also has a quarry tiled floor and some wall bench seating attached to the dado panelling (but, note, it was fitted here from the right-hand room in modern times).\r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; and\r\nAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nThe main bar on the right of the entrance is believed to have been like this for possibly 50 years (difficult to date the bar counter) and there is some very old bar back shelving (and some new ones), fixed seating which does look 50 years old and a stone fireplace that could date from the 1920s? The cottage to the left of the pub was purchased in 1981 and a new bar created. There is a conservatory-style area behind the pub which includes the former outside gents and service is via a window. Other unspoilt aspects of the pub are the inn sign which is painted on the exterior wall and the fact that it still serves Pedigree from a jug sitting on the bar back which is topped up by regular visits to the cellar. Other Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Barley Mow, Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire; Star, Bath, Somerset; Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire; Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, West Wales; Falcon, Arncliffe, North Yorkshire; and Cresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales.",

        "Description": "This popular Fuller\u2019s pub sweeps majestically round the corner of Newgate Street and Giltspur Street. It was built in 1874 but the wonderful fittings we see today are due to a remodelling by Arthur Dixon in 1898-1900 at the height of the fin de si\u00e8cle pub building boom. The separate drinking areas (as indicated by the multiple outside doors) have gone but there is an amazing amount of excellent decoration. The etched, gilded and cut glass panels at the rear are truly spectacular and are the equal of the work at the Princess Louise, Holborn WC1. \r\n\r\nAnother highlight is the small, glazed-in office in the rear of the serving area that was used for conducting the administration of the pub. It has fine etched glass and delicate woodwork. \r\n\r\nDelicate is also the word to describe the small stillion in the middle of the servery with its arched woodwork and ornamented glass. The ceiling too (which probably dates from the original build in 1874), with its swirling relief panels, is a also a fine sight. Less attractive are the three paintings of languid ladies, signed \u2018Hal\u2019, on the right-hand wall, who, apparently, represent agriculture, commerce, industry and art. They are set in an arcade with extensive marble work. Don\u2019t miss the bar counter itself which has unusual, bold, arched decoration. A final curiosity is the heavily carved, sliding door at the rear to the private quarters above. \r\n\r\nVisit at a quiet time (avoid lunchtimes and after 6) and you can ask for a trip down to the cellars which were supposedly the cells of the Gaol of the original Debtors Prison - there are 5 cells of which three can be inspected.",

Door from the car park leads into a lobby with turquoise tiles from floor to ceiling and mosaic floor. Through the inner door to a lobby bar which retains its original bar counter with a new top and two heating pipes around the base; and bar back with some modern additions. There are two remarkably surviving 1920s part leaded screens around both the doors to the gents and ladies \u2013 very rare. There is another short L-shaped screen around a phone \u2018booth\u2019 but originally the screenwork would have been bigger and turned the other way around as this area was originally the off-sales hatch and access to it was from the east side door (not in use) and the screenwork was required to ensure children etc. using the off-sales were unable to see men drinking in the bar. The porch on this side also has tiled walls and mosaic floor. \r\n\r\nThe major change to the layout has been to the room right of the bar - originally it was a bit larger and was shortened when Sam Smiths added a wall to create a passage to/from the west side door. Some of the fixed seating in this room is original, some new in a similar style, bell pushes in a panel above, but new tiles in the fireplace. The Vault in the south east corner has basic fixed bench seating, an original counter, a draught screen by the door, but has lost the fireplace. The pool room in the north east corner has draught screens either side of the door, good set of plain etched 1920s windows, fixed bench seating which looks original and bell pushes in a panel above but has also lost a fireplace. The gents\u2019 has a black and white tiled floor, original tiling to 2/3rds height - Art Deco style in cream, red and black; there is a high-level WC cistern by GRATRIX JNR & BRO LTD, ALPORT WORKS, QUAY STREET, MANCHESTER; and a fine bank of four original urinals; but it has lost its etched panel in the door, the ladies one still remains.",

        "Description": "At the end of a stone-built 1847 terrace and owned by Samuel Smiths since 1977. Previous owners include Chesters Brewery and locals say there is another brewery name in mosaic under the carpet in the front door porch. It retains a lobby bar and three rooms (one brought into pub use) and there are some fittings from an inter-war refurbishment. It is run on traditional lines as a 'good beer and good conversation' pub with no food or electronic distractions. \r\n\r\nA full-height glazed screen separates the porch from the smallish lobby bar. In the latter you will often find as many people as in the rest of the pub! - note the shelves on the wall for stand-up drinking. At the rear is the servery with a solid, probably Victorian, mahogany counter. The bar-back consists of three small fittings of the same style which all look old, but the cabinets on the rear and right sides have some modern additions. There has been the usual loss of lower shelving on the rear section to accommodate two fridges. A local who first came into the pub in c.1950 confirms that the only changes to the servery has been the addition of a wooden structure to reduce the ceiling height. \r\n\r\nOn the left is a large room which has been this size since Victorian times as shown by the bench seating running around most of the room. It has a pair of plain baffles as you enter, two decorative ceiling roses, has a raised area for darts but has lost its fireplace. Note the three bracket-shaped air vents (mirrored outside by iron grilles) \r\n\r\nTo the right are two snugs, the front one retains interwar fixed seating, a baffle by the door, and a tiled fireplace with a marble effect overmantel. The cast-iron tables add to the traditional feel of this room. The rear snug has been in pub use since at least the 1960s and has fixed seating and a modern cast-iron fireplace. \r\n\r\nOn the rear left is a short passage to the toilets with inter-war wording in the doors of 'Ladies' and 'Gents' painted red in etched and frosted windows, probably dating from the 1930s or 1950s. The toilets themselves are modernised.",

        "Pub Name": "Dovey Valley Hotel",
        "Address": "Cemmaes Road, SY20 8JZ",
        "Description": "A railway hotel of c1865-70 located nearly opposite the now disused station. The Newtown to Machynlleth Railway reached Cemmaes Road in 1863, and was subsequently incorporated into the Cambrian Railway. Cambrian Railways then built a branch line from Dinas Mawddwy to Cemmaes Road which opened in 1867. It has a lovely exterior porch with coloured glass and benches either side. Hotel guests, many of whom would have arrived by train, would have entered by the central doorway, which will be back in use when Bed and Breakfast accommodation becomes available in 2014. \r\n\r\nThe hotel bar is barely altered since it was refitted in c.1913 and is a real step back in time. It is accessed from a door on the right-hand side of the building. Originally there was a small servery in the far left hand corner of the room where the floor is wooden and the stable door (the two halves are now joined together) with the figure \u20185\u2019 on it was used to serve customers in the smoke room and there is still a tiny hatch in the hallway. The rest of the floor of the public bar is of Welsh slate and was recently revealed having previously been covered by concrete. \r\n\r\nIt would appear the present three-sided serving area with simple shelving, placed across the innermost corner was added in around 1913 \u2013 on the reverse of one of the framed posters on the wall there is a date of 9th Aug 1913. The servery has a counter screen with still-working vertical sashes, which were raised and lowered at opening and closing times. The old handpumps situated on the rear shelving were converted to serving keg beer in the 1960/70s. There is a red tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace likely to have been installed in around 1913 (log fire in winter) with an old 'Worthington's Burton Ales' mirror above. There are various items of drinks advertising from times past including  an old illuminated \u2018Watney\u2019s Brown Ale\u2019 sign which still works. \r\n\r\nIn the slate-floored passageway beyond the bar look up and you will see a pair of bells on springs which were rung by customers in two rooms using the bell pushes. There are plans to bring the bells back into use. The second, smaller, smoke room lies across the central corridor: it is in occasional use as an overflow from the main bar. It has a lovely old mirror advertising Salt\u2019s Burton Ale and signed by the maker, J. Baird of far-away Glasgow. The doors of the smoke room has the number \u20184\u2019, a survival from the dates when pubs had to have their rooms identified to meet the registration requirements of Customs and Excise authorities. The furniture is a real mixture with much of it suitable for a private living room. But this just serves as a reminder that that\u2019s often exactly what public houses were \u2013 ordinary houses that doubled up as public places to enjoy a drink. There is a dining room / residents lounge on the front right of the hotel which has a figure \u20181\u2019 on the door, a 1930s tiled fireplace and a bell push. A private room on the front left also has a 1930s tiled fireplace. \r\n\r\nOutside gents' and ladies\u2019 (or at least one WC and a separate urinal). There is a parlour next to the smoke room that will be converted into inside toilets. As another reminder of times past, note the remnants of the ancient petrol pump on the car park and the adjacent BP cover to access the supply tank. After a period of uncertainly following the death of long time owner Maurice Davies, it has recently been rescued by a son and mother partnership and is currently open each evening from 6pm with one Welsh real ale on sale . There are plans to offer food and accommodationin the future.",

(There is another in Hull, at the White Hart, Alfred Gelder Street). Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe same architects extended and refitted the pub for the Hull Brewery Company in 1922, adding the grand-domed \u2018orchestra\u2019 area to the main bar, and the resulting layout is much as we see today \u2013 except that an old-style mahogany \u2018Caf\u00e9 Bar\u2019 was sadly destroyed in alterations of the 1980s. The fitted seating (and the stone signage outside) are from the 1922 scheme. Statutorily listed in 2005 following a successful application by CAMRA.",

        "Description": "An early Victorian mid-terrace pub retaining its layout of a central drinking passage with two small rooms each side. There are quarry-tiled floors in the corridor and two rear rooms, but the tenants think there may be original tiled flooring in the two front rooms as well. The splendid drinking passage has a brown Minton tiled dado and a hatch to the side of the servery. The tiny front-left 'snug-bar' has old narrow wooden benches and an original counter, but a modern over-large counter top, which just doesn't fit (literally!); also some of the original bar-back survives - you can see Victorian woodwork - but this has been altered and added to over the years. Rear of the servery on the left is the weakest room, probably converted to pub use around the 1960s: this appears to be an amalgamation with a former private room, some bench seating has been rearranged; the front section has a colourful quarry-tiled floor (of a different design to the rest) and service via a hatch but a new brick fireplace; there may be a Victorian glazed roof above this room, but this has not been investigated. \r\n\r\nOver the corridor, the small front lounge has inter-war fixed seating with two baffles, and a Victorian looking fireplace; also panelling above the bench seating, but no bell-pushes; an excellent little room. The small plain room rear-right has a fine Victorian tiled fireplace including two panels of a relief figure; there's no fixed furniture, but the damage to the floor tiles from darts suggests that it's been in pub use for some time; also pot shelves around. Note that the tenants have applied for listing twice recently and failed. \r\n\r\nThe premises and the whole of the surrounding area are scheduled for redevelopment. The planning process is not yet exhausted but the pub is facing the grave danger of being demolished. \r\n\r\nUpdate August 2016 - plans to redevelop / demolish the pub have now officially been abandoned- the company who wanted to knock the pub down, have downscaled their original plans and the new ones do not affect that row of buildings.",

It lies up a short alleyway off Cornhill beside St Michael\u2019s church \u2013 look out for the massive, iron-bracketed lantern with the pub\u2019s name. The pub is part of a red brick and sandstone block rebuilt in 1885 to designs by architect Banister Fletcher (don\u2019t fall for the \u2018Built 1652\u2019 notices!).  \r\n\r\nThere is an intriguing layout, which is not known to survive anywhere else. The rectangular space is divided up into four by three screens set at right angles to the counter. Originally there would have been no link between the two left-hand and the two right-hand compartments. The distinction between the two parts is emphasised by completely different ceiling treatments: that on the left, unusually, has panels of ceramic or enamelled metal. It is almost as though the pub was built in two stages but there is no evidence of this in the fabric of the building. The screens themselves are fine pieces of mahogany woodwork, decorated with square panels and some glazed parts. The counter is original but has been altered in the right-hand area. The bar-back and seating are modern.  \r\n\r\nThere is a plain cellar bar, used for dining. History on the spot: This was the site of England\u2019s first coffee house, established by a Turk, Pasqua Rosee, and in existence by 1654. Coffee houses played an important part in the social and business lives of the country\u2019s better-off urban population in the 18th century. This one became the Jamaica Coffee House in 1674, changing into a wine house in 1869.",

It had a complete refitting by Stroud Brewery in 1953 and apart from the addition of inside toilets in 1970 it is barely altered since. Licensee Bernard Newman came to the pub when his grandfather died in 1944 and has been in charge since his father passed away in 1976. He must be in his late 1960s and bought the pub from the brewery in 1993. As you enter there is a splendid intact off-sales in a part leaded glass partition with two small windows. \r\n\r\nThe Public Bar to the left is quite large with lino floor, the 1953 bar back including glass block wall behind and the original counter with a heating pipe around it, but there is new panelling attached to the counter front and it has a new top. The fixed seating is from 1953 with baffles at both ends and the stone fireplace could well be from 1953. To the right of the off sales is a small Lounge with classic 1950s tiled fireplace, 1953 bar back, 1953 bar counter with Formica top and small red Formica top tables. To the far right is a rather untidy largish function room which is only used for meetings but Mr Newman is happy to open it for anyone to have a look. It also has a 1953 bar back including glass blocks, 1953 counter, 1953 bench seating and has a vestibule entrance (disused?) to the side of the building.",

        "Address": "The Green, Coldred, CT15 5AJ",
        "Description": "A rare survivor - an intact 1960s refit and still a basic drinkers pub. In 1965 Fremlins doubled the size of the bar by way of a flat roof extension which also brought the toilets inside and this simple two roomed pub has changed very little since. The pub has been in the same family since 1912 with former licensee Daphne Fagg, who recently died aged 92, having been in charge for over 40 years. From the front door go down three steps into the small carpeted Public Bar which has a 1965 bar counter with Formica panelled front and Formica top, and while the Formica covered lower bar back shelving and a drawer for a till remain, in 2011 the utilitarian 1960s bar back with \u2018Fremlins\u2019 illuminated panel at the top and glass shelves was removed. The 1930s looking brick fireplace is also from 1965 says Mrs Fagg  and there is two sections of 1960s fixed seating and a baffle by the door.  \r\n\r\nThe small carpet tiled Saloon Bar on the left is accessed by a door from the bar and it also has an exterior door where you go down 4 steps. The room is almost wedge-shaped with a long 1960s bar counter set at an angle with a Formica front and top, also a pair of handpumps which have CO2 dispensers fitted to them. The Saloon Bar still retains its bar back with 'Fremlins' illuminated panel at the top and glass shelves and there is another 1960s fireplace, leatherette cushioned fixed seating and classic 1960s small low Formica top tables. Note the very 1960s louvres near the door and a tea chest base for a skiffle band which is used every Sat night.  \r\n\r\nIn the garden there is an outside i.e. open to the elements skittle alley (the pub has three teams) with one covered side. The alley is of concrete and has a camber with a difference of 2 inches between the top and sides. The Dover District Skittles summer league has three divisions for men (Sunday evenings) and women (Wed eves). Has up to three real ales served from casks on top of the bar; no draught lager, only bottles! Most Sat evenings a musician (Country & Western) turns up from Dover to play.  \r\n\r\nThere are annual competitions since 1970s for Marrow, Pumpkin, Sunflower (height), Onion with a fortnight between them and cups for the winners - then the items are auctioned for charity. Making an occasional appearance in the bar is the rare pub game of Daddlums (Kentish Skittles) - Dover branch of CAMRA has a table with legs that can be removed enabling it to be transported in an estate car. Closed lunchtimes; Open 6 (7 Sun) to 11.",

        "Pub Name": "Red Lion",
        "Address": "55 High Street, Southampton, City Centre, SO14 2NS",
        "Description": "A remarkable late C15 and early C16 high-ceilinged interior with two galleries within a long narrow building. The fa\u00e7ade, however, is much more recent: the Tudor-style black-and-white upper storeys with stone mullioned windows probably date from the 1920s while the ground floor was re-fronted during repairs after wartime bomb damage. The pub layout is very largely as it was before the war. The front door leads into a corridor which runs all the way down the left hand side of the building to the toilets at the rear. The front section of the corridor has floor to ceiling fielded panelling, possibly from the 1930s, and a door with the figure \u20181\u2019 on it leads into the main bar.  \r\n\r\nThe highlight and the reason for the Grade II* listing of this splendid pub is the late medieval hall-house, the hall of which (in the centre of the long building) soars through to its full height and displays its massive timber framing and is now the main bar. The very high hall which rises the whole height of the building includes two balustraded galleries probably dated from the 17th century and which can be accessed by a staircase. The room has more floor to ceiling fielded panelling at the front and up to the fireplace level at the rear.  \r\n\r\nThe rear gallery had been enclosed at some stage and it was reinstated to it's original state as part of the restoration work in 1950-2. At the rear of the room is a grand early 16th century stone fireplace with moulded 4-centred arch and rounded tracery patterns in square panels in the front of the overmantel. Note the figure \u20185\u2019 on the door to the cellar.  \r\n\r\nThe bar fittings possibly came from another war-damaged pub although the heated (and still functioning) foot-rail the heating pipe around it is much older. The unusual 'letterbox' at the top of the bar back was installed by Grand Met/Watneys in the early 1970s - it displayed the details shown on the electronic till in a way that could easily be seen by the customer! The bar is called the Henry IV Court Room as it is reputed to be the 'Court room' where the intending assassins of Henry V, Lord Scrops of Masham, Sir Thomas Grey and the flatly of Cambridge were tried when Henry V was in Southampton in 1415, preparing for Horfleur and Agincourt.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a separate Lounge, now a dining room with another early 16th century stone fireplace with moulded 4-centred arch and rounded tracery patterns in square panels in the front of the overmantel. The half timbered walls come from a post-war \u2018Mock Tudor\u2019 refurbishment. On the wall of the main bar is a photo of the last coach and four horses and a timetable implying a twice-weekly Red Rover service from the Red Lion to the Stag Brewery, Pimlico Brewery until 1952! However, the coaching era finished in the mid 19th century so presumably the photo was taken at the time of the re-opening of the pub following restoration and this was celebrated with the appearance of the coach and horses?",

The Cotswold Lounge, as it was known, lies behind the shallow bay window and is a wonderful survival, complete with its full-height wall panelling ('moulded hardwood laths threaded together on wire to form continuous lengths of decorative panelling' states the local newspaper review when it opened) and curved vertically lapped counter; a thatched marquee over the counter was removed in the 1980s. Seating in the shallow bay is in three sections, separated by two leaded-effect glass panels. Coal-effect fire with chrome surround (looks like the original) with stone mantelpiece and stone/brick half wall. The intact gents' has seven big urinals, tiled walls, quarry-tiled floor and sinks with bizarre taps.

        "Description": "The Turnpike (formerly the Wellington) was originally half its current size and consisted of two rooms and a passageway. Then in c1962 a former confectioners shop was purchased and the two roomed pub we now see was created. The frontage is of stone with brick at first floor level and is clearly from c1962 but parts of the building could be older. The bar on the left, the Vault, is in the original pub premises and has a bar counter of ply panelling that looks more 1930s than 1960s but the bar top is a modern replacement. The bar back shelves are attached to panelling that looks very 1960s and there are two large mirrors above. The unusual floor to ceiling fireplace surround is made from cobblestones, and was added in the 1960s. There are two radiators with distinctive 1960s wood surrounds. \r\n\r\nThe lounge on the right in the former confectioners shop part has all but one section of wall with 1960s full height panelling. In the corner where the panelling is missing I was told that there was a \u2018hanging gardens\u2019 feature with plastic grapes etc. hanging from the wooden trestles that are common in 1960s builds/refits i.e. part of the original interior has been lost. The bar counter whilst looking 1960s with its leatherette padded sections only dates from c2002, when they also replaced the bar top and re-upholstered the fixed bench seating. The bar back shelves are attached to panelling that looks very 1960s and there is a row of six mirrored panels above. The false ceiling over the counter with its modern lighting could be a later addition. The floor to ceiling 'random\u2019 green slate fireplace surround also dates from the 1960s.",

        "Address": "Church Street, Audley, ST7 8DE",
        "Description": "Rebuilt in 1933, the new facade was set back some three feet from the original - evidenced by before and after photos framed in the Public bar. Features celebrate the local landowning family. This sizeable 1930s brick built pub is little altered with three rooms. There is a splendid hall from the front door (a 1970s replacement) with 1930s fielded panelling and a tiled floor. The door to the servery for staff has a sliding leaded window, shelf and a \u20182\u2019 on it. On the front right is the Public Bar with \u20181\u2019 on the door, which has lost its leaded glass panel. The most distinct feature is the three sectioned ceiling with a cornice of grapes and Tudor rose (symbols on the Bouchier family crest). There is more fielded panelling around the walls, a tiled floor, what looks like the original counter but with a new top and the brick fireplace has been replaced. Originally the bar back went half way across the servery with a gap for staff i.e. part of the bar back fitting was removed in the 1980s. There is a piece of modern shelving on the outside wall side. Recent redecoration (2021) intoduced a gre/blue colour scheme and green re-upholstery on the bench seating \n\nOn the rear right is the lounge still with its \u2018Lounge\u2019 leaded panel and \u20183\u2019 on the door. It too has a three sectioned ceiling with a cornice of grapes and Tudor rose symbols and 1930s dado panelling. Above the Tudor shaped stone arch fireplace is a plaster crest of the Bouchier family (Lord Audley married into the Bouchier family). The original counter has Fleur-de-lys symbols but a new Formica top and the fixed seating looks like a modern addition rather than a replacement. At the rear of the lounge is the inner Off Sales door with \u20185\u2019 on it (which has been moved from where there is now a wine display in the servery) forming part of a partition wall, together with the original exterior doors! The partition wall was added to create space for the kitchen behind. The exterior off sales door can be seen by walking down a path alongside the pub. This room, too, has been recently redecorated and the wood slatting on the back wall is not especially in keeping with the rest of the decor. The rear left room has \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 in the leaded panel in the door and a \u20184\u2019 on it and is now used for diners. It retains its original 1930s brick and wood surround fireplace, original fixed seating all around (re-upholstered with red moquette in the 1980's) and bell pushes. The gents has floor to ceiling fielded panelled walls in the ante room, but the toilets themselves are modernised. \n\nA dado of fielded panelling runs up the staircase to the first floor where the function room has a 1930s brick fireplace, the bar looks like a early 1970s addition as is the fixed seating. The pub was built with an early form of air conditioning driven by electricity - the air extractor is in the loft and the licensee believes it could still work. Look for the vents above the public bar counter, lounge counter and in the function room, also circular wall vents in all three downstairs rooms. Although the front windows are modern uPVC, they are a copy of the original ones and set into the original \"tongue and groove\" brick window stanchions, which were carefully dismantled  and then reassembled with the new double glazed units. It is closed lunchtimes Mon to Sat; opens at 7 (6 Thu \u2013 pie night) to 11; Sun 12 to 3; 7 to 10.30.",

The star here is the superb Oak Room at the rear right with an etched 'Oak Room' with lion symbol in the door. This small room has quality panelling from the period 1910-20? including decoratively carved panels at the top and a splendid Tudor arch shaped carved wood surround fireplace with a brown tiled interior, a copper hood and above is a row of wooden segments including some shields. The mantelpiece is based on 17th century carved decoration with three arched sections, the central one with a shield in relief and there are three oblong carved panels above.\r\n\r\nTowards the top of the fielded panelling are more oblong carved sections. The decorative plaster sectional ceiling includes Tudor rose symbols picked out in deep red with green painted leaves, unicorns, stags, cockerels, animal faces and birds in relief and some coats of arms; also a cornice / frieze of grapes and acanthus leaves with the grapes picked out in both yellow and deep purple and other decoration in green. The fixed seating which also dates from 1910-1920 period runs around most of the room and there are bell pushes above. On the north east corner of the room there is no seating and here the panelling looks more like c1970s work. Note the rare hinged baffle by the door. The wall to the bar side consists of a large stained and leaded screen featuring lions and there is a more modest stained and leaded window at the rear. \r\n\r\nThe rear left room with 'Commercial Room' deep etched and leaded panel has a large rear stained and leaded window but no other old fittings. Note the door in the rear passage has deep etched panels 'Toilets' and, unusually, 'Back Entrance'! Doors have massive carved mahogany door surrounds. The front two rooms have been knocked into one. The bar counter is a replacement and the bar back is a mixture of old and new woodwork - note the etched and frosted panels on the right hand side near the staircase which has a fine newel post. There is plenty of original fixed seating but the Victorian style fireplace is a replacement. There is a carved newall post at the foot of the staircase including a capital and leave symbols at the foot. Also, a part glazed partition alongside the staircase with some etched panels.",

        "Pub Name": "Royal Oak",
        "Address": "Wineham Lane, Wineham, BN5 9AY",
        "Description": "The Royal Oak is an excellent example of the quintessential English country inn. A 17th-century unspoilt cottage-style, thatched pub set back from the road and with a perfect pub garden, making it very popular in good weather. Whilst you may find other idyllic village inns around the country you are, sadly, very unlikely to find many with an interior that matches the unspoilt exterior. Here you will find all the essential elements of a traditional English pub - three small rooms, one with a brick floor, low beamed ceiling, inglenook fireplace, scrubbed tables, and local real ales served from casks on a stillage behind the bar - perfect! \r\n\r\nOriginally owned by Rock Brewery (Brighton), then Portsmouth & Brighton United Breweries, passing to Brickwoods in 1948, then via Whitbread to Punch Taverns eventually. Present owners, Michael and Sharon Bailey, purchased the freehold in 2009. The left-hand side of the cottage is their living accommodation. It was run by the Peacock family for 60 years until 2007 and is barely altered in that time. The last change to the interior was in 1946/7 when the former straight counter running from the front window to the rear of the room was altered to the present polygonal shape creating the present public bar. The disused door on the right still has the bell on it to announce your arrival! \r\n\r\nWhat is now the main public bar has standing timbers dividing the bare wooden floor, part open rafter right side containing the counter. On the far right are wall benches perched on logs against the old panelled walls; part of the seating includes the original 'United Ales & Stouts' sign outside the pub and the wording can just be made out if you are prepared to crawl on the floor (but not recommended as the locals will think you completely mad!). Some original oak flooring remains behind the bar and to the far right-hand side, but the remainder in this bar was redone circa 1995 by the brewery, and is of deal (cheaper than oak). \r\n\r\nThe bar counter is original. Small bowls for coins behind the bar were acquired in 1970s when Barclays Bank, Hurstpierpoint branch was refitted. There are some old bar back shelves but those over the stillage were fitted in the 1980s to meet with Health & Safety requirements. Note the small brick fireplace behind the servery - one of only a handful of such fireplaces known to exist. Beer is served from casks on stillage (with in-cask cooling) clearly visible from the counter and there are old shelves situated above the casks. \r\n\r\nThe room on the left was originally the main drinking space and has an original brick floor laid on bare earth. Original ceiling beams exposed in 1946/47 when the match-board added in Victorian times was removed throughout so now standing timbers separate them. This is the date that the internal wall and door between original tap room and the \"new bar\" were removed. The old brick inglenook fireplace has basic benches either side, a Royal Oak fireback, includes an oven and the mantelshelf almost reaches the low ceiling. The fireplace was lifted off the floor by 6\" in the 1980s, to meet Health and Safety concerns. Curved slatted wood back to two parts of bench seating are old barrel staves and there are two scrubbed tables, bare low benches and rustic dado panelling. The door at the rear left was originally an exterior door until the ladies' toilet was added in 1946/47 at the rear in a brick extension. The door to the ladies has a blocked spy-hole on it (but not discernible - 2020). \r\n\r\nAt the rear right a door leads to the saloon in an extension to the original building and it has an original parquet flooring with each block being at least 6\" deep. The fireplace was removed in the 1950s when the ladies toilet was added. If you look under the pew on the rear wall you will see the some concrete remains of the fireplace. This small room retains its original ceiling but with false beams, as well as timber effect on the walls all fitted in 1980s, and a pine door to the main bar which replaced the original one (done on the cheap by the brewery). The recess area to the right hand side of saloon was created at same time and leads to the cellar with a hatch to the back of the bar There are scrubbed tables, pew, basic bench seating and piano which all add to the traditional feel of this room. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side of the pub is a corrugated iron building, originally the village hall, which is still in use as a polling station. It is claimed to be a prototype of what was sent to Australia as a flat packed building type and dates from the 1850s. It has recently been converted into part dining room with a small counter added, a pot belied stove and is also used for small functions and as overflow. The pub has an outside gents' on the right hand side (previously at the rear) which was added in 1946, which is also the date of the exterior porch. \r\n\r\n*2008 Sunday Times Travel Supplement.",

        "Description": "The Lord Nelson was once magnificent - even now it retains some of the most spectacular mirrorwork in the country. Pride of place goes to a large painted and gilded mirror of the great admiral receiving the surrender after the battle of Cape Vincent in 1797 from some shifty, swarthy Spanish types. There are two more vast mirrors behind the servery but one is cracked and the other is largely covered up. The maker was a James Carter of Gray\u2019s Inn Road and they date from around 1888. The details include grapes, kingfishers, vases of fruit and foliage trails.\r\n\r\nThere is also what is probably a unique feature in a pub - an impressive timber arcade striding across the servery with two bays sitting on top of the counter and a third spanning a walkway between two counters. The screen and bar-back have wonderful detail including coloured panels advertising all manner of drinks - champagne, finest old brandies, liqueurs, ports and sherries - the list goes on.\r\n\r\nThe serving area has an extraordinary shape and projects out into the main bar. This is because it serviced a whole variety of small compartments, reminders of which are preserved in the door glass (perhaps of the 1950s) which notes \u2018public bar\u2019 and \u2018saloon bar\u2019. At the rear is another room entered through an archway. It too has its own outside entrance with fine Victorian decorative glass (also proclaiming \u2018saloon bar\u2019). This room also has its own counter screen, like that in the main bar, which has a fine old clock over a doorway.",

It was built by East End brewers Charringtons, as indicated by their emblem of the Toby jug on the large tiled panel which bears the former pub name in diagonal lettering. The present one, befitting for an Irish pub, comes from a river and lough in Galway.\n\n\nThere are three rooms ranged along the side street, New Church Road. On the corner is the public bar, then a snug and finally a saloon. The higher status of the latter is indicated by the slightly superior panelling compared to the other two rooms.\n\n\nThe fittings are all low-key as was common in the 1930s. The most striking feature perhaps is the band of terrazzo in front of the snug bar counter, patterned like an over-size piano keyboard. The bar-back has unusual treatment with dimpled glass panels forming the back wall to it and the front windows too have some surviving dimpled glazing and attractive strips of green glass.",

        "Address": "137 Crewe Road, Haslington, CW1 5RG",
        "Description": "A late 17th-century building with later alterations and retaining its five rooms and entrance hall. The star here and the reason for its inclusion as one of CAMRA's Heritage Pubs is the Oak Room at the rear which is lined with a tremendous display of old panelling, probably from the early 17th century. The excellent mantelpiece of oak panelling features three decorative arches in relief and twin Doric columns at each end. In research undertaken by Pub Heritage Group member, Chris Witt, he was told by the owners, Robinson\u2019s of Stockport, that it was here when they acquired the pub back in 1929 from Kay\u2019s Atlas Brewery of Ardwick, Manchester. Where it came from and when is unknown but was probably brought from a gentry house at some stage. Fanciful tales abound of it having been salvaged from ships, even, according to one version, from vessels in the Spanish Armada. \r\n\r\nThe Oak Room has a button on the old door with the figure '6' on it. There is a Tudor shaped stone fireplace with brown glazed stone interior, fixed seating with bell-pushes above and leaded window with a colourful crest which are all of a distinctive 1920s style so the room could date from just before the pub passed from the ownership of Kay's Brewery to Robinsons in 1929. The other main change took place in 1978 when an extension was added and the servery was moved from the right of the pub to its present 'island bar' position so the present bar counter, bar back and some seating are replacements. \r\n\r\nOther rooms include the games room on the front right which is on two levels and has a glass covered section of wattle and daub and a brick fireplace from the 1930s, genuine beams and a bench that has been carefully created to form a ceiling over the stairs leading to the cellar. The main room in the front of the servery has an old bench from the 1920/30s and a brick fireplace that looks to date from the 1930s. \r\n\r\nAcross the small hall/passage to the left of the main bar is the Dining Room on the front left which has a 1930s brick fireplace, old dado panelling and a corner display cabinet. The area on the right of the servery between the games room and the Oak Room has post-war seating - this was where the servery was situated until 1978 and why there is a hatch in the wall between this area and the games room. The present servery dates from 1978 - originally in this area was a fireplace and the outside gents.",

        "Description": "A visit to the Red Lion is a must to see a 'parlour bar' / tiny snug which is an example of how many traditional Welsh 'beer house' looked prior to the late 1880s and the introduction of bar counters. The left hand snug (called the 'Bull Pen' in the 1950s) features a curved settle around a range fireplace (the surround was brick until 1950s when it was plastered over - see the dated photograph by the side) with iron stays from the top of the settle to the beams above. \r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Clent, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, Yorkshire, West;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; and Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nThe copper hood above the fireplace has a 1960s appearance. Nowadays you walk around the outside of the settle to go to a hatch for service - in the old days you would have been served direct to your seat with the publican fetching the beer from the cellar. There are some very old shelves for a bar back. Up to 40 years ago the room at the rear was just the left-hand half with its stone fireplace. In the 1960s it was doubled in size when the house next door was purchased by Lees Brewery (primarily to add indoor toilets) and the front pool room was created which still retains a period bar counter.",

        "Description": "An inn dating from 1782 - the rings for tethering horses are still to be found near the entrance - and was originally part of a working farm. This pub appears to have been refitted in the inter-war period (possibly immediate post-war) and retains a rare snug (or 'parlour bar') where customers sit behind the bar counter while bar staff serve from the same room/space. Ye Horns Inn has been in the same family ownership since 1952 and the last change was in the mid 1950s when a partition that originally separated the main public bar from a corridor in front of the servery was removed.\n\r\nThe servery has an intact screened bar still with three rising panels, two of which are locked in an open position. The counter front is of classic 1930s brick in three sections separated by wooden strips. The door into the snug or room behind the servery is marked 'Private' so ask if it is possible to sit in this area - in the UK there are only two other similar rooms hidden behind the bar servery - the 'Inner Sanctum' at the Bridge, Topsham, Devon and the 'Select' at the Arden Arms, Stockport, Greater Manchester. This small room has a baffle as you enter, a brick and carved wood surround fireplace from the inter-war period, above it bar back shelving which looks like it could date from the 1930s, a panelled dado and a carved settle.\n\r\nIn front of the servery the main room is small with old fixed seating in one corner, a brick/stone fireplace that could date from the 1970s with a copper trim at floor level and a settle. To the left of the passage from the front entrance are two small dining rooms - the front one has the figure '4' on the door and has lost its fireplace; the rear one has '5' on the door and a 1950s brick fireplace. In the passage there is a small hatch with leaded windows for service from the side of the bar. Through a door to the right with '3' on the back of it is a hall leading from the side door on Inglewhite Lane and off this another small dining room which has a '1' on the door, a fine plasterwork ceiling and a inter-war tiled and wood surround fireplace. There is a large dining room on the first floor with another 1950s brick fireplace and also another small dining room.",

The only changes appear to be the loss of the in use up to the early 1980s upstairs cellar (now a bedroom) originally serviced by a pulley system through a gated large arch, now blocked, at the front and the conversion of the off-sales into a kitchen. Pub has a renowned sloping floor and has been regularly prone to flooding. Each entrance on the left and right leads to a drinking lobby and three rooms with no connection between them. \r\n\r\nOn the left a dado panelled passage has two sets of twin doors with 'Bar Parlour' etched glass panels and leads to a lobby with more dado panelling and a hatch to the side of the servery. Note the original 'Gentlemen' and 'Ladies' illuminated hanging signs and etched wording in the tops of the doors. The rear door with 'Bar Parlour' panels leads to what is currently the pool room with an original Tudor-shaped stone fireplace painted red and cream and original fixed seating. Across a passage that leads to the rear door is a small narrow room with leaded windows overlooking the bowling green, a sliding door for service and fixed seating that may well have been added at a later date. \r\n\r\nThe larger public bar at the front has twin doors with 'Public Bar' etched panels, a large brick and stone fireplace, original fixed seating all around the room with bell-pushes, original bar counter and bar-back fitting. From the right hand side front door a dado panelled passage has two sets of twin doors with 'Buffet' and 'Smoke Room' etched glass panels and leads to a large lobby with more dado panelling and a hatch to the side of the servery. Note the original 'Ladies' illuminated hanging sign and etched wording in the top of the door. \r\n\r\nThe front bar has 'Buffet' in the twin doors, original fixed seating with bell-pushes, some dado panelling, an original bar counter, an original bar-back fitting still with shutters that can be lowered and locked to protect the spirits but no longer in use. The first rear 'Smoke Room' has a Tudor style stone fireplace painted red and cream and original fixed seating in bays. The rear right 'Dining Room' has original panelling to picture frame height, original fixed seating and a good wood surround fireplace. The only detracting factor is the amount of \u2018memorabilia collections\u2019/tat that covers most of the walls. Modernised toilets.",

        "Pub Name": "Springfield Hotel",
        "Address": "47 Springfield Road, Wigan, WN6 7BB",
        "Description": "An impressive three-storey building of red brick and orange terracotta in Free Renaissance style with a turret and impressive pediments over the two main entrances. It was built 1903 by Heaton and Ralph of Wigan for Oldfield Brewery and retains most of its ornate Edwardian multi-roomed interior though there has been some opening out. An old bell-box high up in the lobby bar shows 'Billiard RM', 'Gents RM', 'Commercial RM', 'Lounge', 'Front DR\u2019 and 'Sitting RM\u2019 and all six are still readily identifiable. \r\n\r\nThe chief glory is the huge island screened servery, a symphony in heavily carved mahogany, which is one of the finest in the country - the lower rising sashes are missing but that's all. It's arguably worth recognising as a Heritage Pub for this alone. There is though much else to admire, notably lots of Art Nouveaux design green tiling in the inner lobby, the passage leading to the lobby bar and the lobby bar itself. There are also etched windows, original fireplaces, ornate cornices and some original fixed seating. \r\n \r\nThe inner lobby has a good dado of green tiles with Art Nouveau-style designs and the inner door is situated in a full height screen with etched glass side panels. The passage leading to the lobby bar and around the lobby bar itself is a further dado of green tiles with Art Nouveau designs. To the left of the lobby is the Darby Lounge, formerly the Front Room and Lounge, with a doorway into the Front Room and a big mahogany arched opening between the lobby bar and the lounge. A montage photo in the pub, dating from shortly after the opening, shows that this wide arch opening has always been the arrangement. The lounge retains original fixed seating with bell-pushes and two Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplaces; also a good cornice and is now a venue for karaoke. On the far left in a single-storey extension is the former Billiard Room, now a function room. It retains two sets of \u2018Billiard\u2019, \u2018Room\u2019 windows advertising he billiard room: the fixed seating appears post-war but there are signs of older bell-pushes above. \r\n\r\n The land has now been sold off for housing. The Commercial Room on the front right has an unusual vestibule-like screened entrance with original fixed seating and bell pushes all around, a \u2018Commercial Room\u2019 etched window and others, but some original ones lost, and retains the refreshed Edwardian tiled, new cast-iron and wood surround fireplace with pillars holding up the shelves above. Another dado tiled lobby on the right (Rylands Street) side with a \u2018Springfield Hotel\u2019 etched panel in the inner door situated in a full-height screen. A door off the lobby leads into the Vault (or Gents' Room) with a new tiled floor and an impressive carved mahogany screened servery with reaches up to the high ceiling with a number of columns and glazed panels, but this was installed by Tetley Walker in 1990 as a copy of the lobby bar one. This small room has a very good cornice, wall bench seating attached to the dado panelling, a \u2018Bar\u2019 etched window and domino tables. \r\n \r\nOpened up to the corridor near the toilets on 1990 is the small \u2018Sitting Room\u2019 with a pool table. The fixed seating here looks post-war and there are some stained glass windows. An old advertising poster in the lobby bar area shows the former bowling greens with the wording 'Noted for its spacious bowling greens recognised to be the finest in the country. Special facilities to cater for charabanc parties etc. covered stands accommodate 2,000 spectators.' The land at the rear of the pub was sold off in post war times and the bowling greens were where there is now a housing estate. The pub was sold by Punch Taverns in 2012 and real ale installed by the new owner.",

        "Address": "178 Union Street, Oldham, OL1 1EN",
        "Description": "An early 20th century brick building which had a quality refitting in 1928 including the insertion of a splendid glazed servery and lots of wall tiling. The inner lobby on Union Street side has a modern tiled floor and the walls which have inter-war tiled walls have been covered by wallpaper due to damage to the tiling. Through the inner double doors (originally planned as a revolving door) that have original diamond sectioned multiple glazed panels is the Lobby Bar area which has more inter-war tiled walls covered by wallpaper due to damage to the tiling. The star here is the rare intact fully screened curved servery reaching up to the ceiling where the lower panels can still be lowered but are kept in the raised position due to a pot shelf full of glasses. Most sash windows in similar screened serveries operate using cord but here they have linked chains to operate them. Around the lobby area there are some inter-war tiled walls still exposed. The servery area is little altered (only one fridge and a small washbasin added) with some drawers in the curved bar back and even some tiling on the walls. Note the old bell box but there are no signs of bell pushes. At the rear of the lobby bar area is two sections of old fixed seating but there were changes to the window (with old \u2018Royal Oak\u2019 and \u2018Crown\u2019 leaded panels) in 1984 when the toilets beyond were re-arranged. The 1928 ladies toilets were on the rear left and the present ladies\u2019 are were the 1928 gents toilets were situated and the present gents\u2019 occupy where originally what was originally the scullery. \r\n \r\nOn the right of the lobby on Union Street side a door with original diamond sectioned multiple glazed panels leading to a small Vault This has a small bar, more like a hatch, with a further section of the shuttered servery and here the lower section is still raised and lowered on a daily basis \u2013 very rare! The inter-war fixed seating has draught screens near the door, and there is a small wood surround fireplace that looks from the 1920s but is disused. On the left side of the pub the front Commercial Room and rear Snug have been knocked into one and some original (i.e. c.1900) fixed seating remains at the front. Note the fine \u2018Royal Oak\u2019 inter-war etched windows on the front, more and also a brewery logo (?) ones on the rear windows and colourful leaded lights throughout the pub including oak tree and crown symbols. The combined room has lost both fireplaces, has two doorways leading into it and now houses a pool table. \r\n \r\nOn the Rhodes Bank (right hand) side the exterior door leads into a lobby with 2/3rds height inter-war tiled walls and a door leads into a rare intact off sales with more 2/3rds height inter-war tiled walls, a black and white tiled floor, and a further piece of shuttered servery up to the ceiling still intact with the lower section permanently closed. There is a splendid mahogany partition wall with glazed panels at the top that separates the off sales from the lobby bar with a door leading into the latter. \r\n \r\nTiling continues up the open staircase in the lobby bar and there is a good stained and leaded window on the first floor with more dado tied walls. Upstairs is a function room which retains a rare counter screen \u2013 few first floor bars retain old fittings. Again, the sash sections with metal chains can still operate and there are small fixed glazed sections \u2013 note the figure \u201811\u2019 over the right hand one. There are inter-war fireplaces (blocked-up) at each end of the room (no indication it was ever two rooms) and narrow strips of wood are on all the walls with Artex in between indicating changes in the 1960s? In the corner are two originally \u2018unisex\u2019 WC\u2019s but now labelled as a ladies toilet \u2013 however, party organisers are allowed to use them \u2018as they like\u2019!",

        "Description": "Burlingtons Bar is quite simply one of the greatest pub rooms in Britain - a late Victorian below-ground bar covered from head to foot with tiles and having a magnificent ceramic bar counter. When the St Anne\u2019s Hotel was demolished in 1985 and replaced by the Crescent Pub - now the Town House - the original basement bar, once known as Burlington Bertie\u2019s, was preserved and it became a nightclub by the name of Tiles. \r\n\r\nThe bar, which is easily visible through the windows, is an excellent example of complete fitting out by Craven Dunnill, dating no doubt from the late 1890s, and includes a good geometric tiled floor, moulded wall tiling (some plain, some flowers and patterns) and an exceedingly long ceramic barfront in one of the firm\u2019s two standard designs. It is identical to the bar front at the Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham;  and the Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland and in colour is mostly yellow, brown, green and pink, with some floral motifs. It has a fairly restrained bar-back: the lion heads conceal apertures that once held pipes for dispensing spirits. \r\n\r\nPlease note the bar is not currently open to the public (but may be in the future) and to visit it you will need to ring the manager of the (modern) pub in advance to arrange a visit at quiet time. \r\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; \r\nBurlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; and Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.\r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant.",

        "Description": "The term \u201clittle gem\u201d has become something of a clich\u00e9 but springs immediately to mind on entering this tiny one-bar pub. A narrow three-storey building of brick built 1860s. It was given a good quality refurbishment in the 1890s. In 1921 it was purchased by Benskins Watford Brewery Limited and at this time it had a Private Bar, Public Bar and Tap Room. It was named after the Great Northern Railway station which opened in Bute Street in 1858.  \r\n\r\nYou enter via the left hand door which originally led to the off sales or private bar but the partition was removed a number of years ago. The right hand door was the original entrance to the public bar but now it is out of use. By the left hand door there is a short screen painted a beige colour with an etched glass panel in the top half. There is a dado of dark green tiling with a tulip motif in relief all around the room and the ceiling is held up by a pillar with a simple capital of leaf decoration all painted dark green; three ceiling roses.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter is of an inter-war style having a canted front recently painted dark green. The wooden display cabinets and pot shelf above the bar counter are modern. The four-bay bar back fitting dates from the 1890s with a mirrored back and slender columns holding up the shelves. In the servery there is a door with a \u2018Bar\u2019 etched panel. Commendably, there is no loss of lower shelves as a fridge is sensibly placed under the bar counter. At the rear on the right is a 1930s brick fireplace painted dark blue. Along the right hand wall is some 1960s seating with metal legs. At the front of the room is a rare domino table with holders for your pint glass on each corner.  \r\n\r\nSadly, most of the patterned glass on the front has been replaced, presumably because of breakages. However, at the rear of the room there is an exterior-looking window with an etched panel. Beyond it was a room, once a lounge, later a pool room but now a smoking area. The ladies\u2019 toilets are outside whereas the gents' toilet are inside - both are modernised.",

        "Description": "One of the last remaining traditional pubs in the city centre, the \u201cChamp\u201d retains, largely unaltered, its late 19th century interior in an 18th century building. \r\n\r\nBy the front door there is a draught screen and a rare part glazed partition wall that separates the public bar on the left and a smaller lounge on the right. On the rear left it a now disused door with an old etched 'Public Bar' panel which indicates a partition has been lost - possibly an off-sales was accessed from the front door? \r\n\r\nThe bare boarded wood-panelled public bar has a marvellous etched window showing the Champion in action, but is not original having been smashed and replaced a number of times (the pub lies on the notorious \u201cKing Street Run\u201d). It retains a Victorian panelled counter which has been moved slightly in recent times. The bar-back looks mainly Victorian but there has been some changes as up to the 1980s casks were stillaged within the servery. The mirrors look modern and there are few lower shelves. The room retains old fitted seating on the front side and a bare bench at the rear left. \r\n\r\nThe panelled right hand room has a wood block floor. The small angled bar counter is of the same style as the public bar one so is also Victorian. A former fireplace has been converted into a tiny seating alcove. Another small nook may have been cupboards converted into a small seating area? Fixed benches with modern leather upholstery can be found on the front wall side and attached to the partition. The small square tables here are old. A passageway at the rear with modern dado panelling leads to the toilets that were added in the 1980s, replacing the outside loos.",

        "Description": "A late 18th century or early 19th century building. The pub originally consisted of two (or three) rooms at the front. You entered by the now not-used front door which leads to a short quarry tiled passage with old dado panelling. Latch door on the right leads to the main quarry tiled room now used by diners. This former public bar, has a low heavily beamed roof and black-bricked, alcoved fireplace and an old fixed bench on the left. It is not obvious where the original bar counter was positioned - the present one is much further back and dates from 60s (??). The room is much larger than you expect an old pub room to be and you can see the quarry tiles on the far right are a different shade and the dado panelling is genuinely old on the left, but more modern on the right. My guess is the bar has been amalgamated with former private quarters. There is a snug, the second original pub room on the left of the passage from the front door. This has old dado panelling and a pot belly stove (and a staircase to private quarters) and the room is available for private parties, otherwise it is not now in use. A second bar, now the main bar, was added possibly in the 1970s? and has a brick bar and traditional bar back. This is situated in an extension to the original building and a further modern extension houses a dining room. Reassessed and removed from the inventory.",

        "Description": "This village pub has three small rooms - the middle and right hand ones have barely changed in over 40 years. Rebuilt after a fire in the late 19th century, it originally consisted of the two left hand rooms with the right room added when rebuilt. Up to c.1960 the left hand room contained a bar counter in the front right hand part of it - there are markings on the ceiling and wall to confirm this. Until the 1960s you walked from the front door to the end of the passage (where the kitchen door is now situated) and turned left into the room to get served. The off sales door was further back from where the door across the passage is now situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middle room with its red and black quarry tile floor, old dado panelling and a basic bare bench was the tap room. Then in c.1960 the present counter was added - this is why the fireplace is positioned so close to the bar - and a bar back of shelves attached to ply panelling added.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right hand room also has old dado panelling, the bar counter was added c.1960 and the fireplace dates from 1970s. Nowadays the original bar room on the left has dado panelling, a counter and bar back shelves added in the late 1980s.",

To the right is the superb\u00a0traditional quarry-tiled public bar which retains old dado panelling with bare bench seating, old wood surround fireplace and a splendid curved high-backed settle. The counter was added in post war times and behind it\u00a0a stillage contains\u00a0casks of Adnams beers. To the left of the passage is the Saloon or lounge bar which was formerly two small rooms (possibly the Saloon in the front and living quarters at the rear with its inglenook fireplace?). This room sports\u00a0two classic forms of pub re-fitting used in the early 1960s, of which few examples now survive\u00a0- a bar counter of brick with old bottles set into it; and wood added to the walls to give\u00a0a Mock-Tudor effect. In 1963 the toilets and a games annexe to the right of the public bar was added. You can play traditional pub games such as Devil Among The Tailors, Shove H'appeny and Darts\u00a0- the pub claims the Shah of Persia played darts here in 1965. What makes this pub so popular is that all the work is very much in sympathy with the historic core.",

The panelling has the inscription \"ER 35' which dates it as 1594 so must have been brought from elsewhere. The public bar on the right was extended back in the 1960s and retains a tiled fireplace of that date, but the bar fittings are modern. If the bar fittings are all modern this is very marginal.",

The original pub comprised\u00a0the two rooms on the left - public bar and former bottle and jug\u00a0- plus\u00a0the outside gents on the left, which is still in use. The\u00a0two rooms are little altered. The front door leads you into a delightful snug, squeezed between the two other bars. It has a parquet floor, Victorian bar counter, a\u00a0bar back consisting\u00a0of old shelves on a mirrored back and the only\u00a0two small benches by way of furniture.\n\r\nA part-glazed partition wall separates the shug from a basic traditional public bar on the left. Its\u00a0walls have\u00a0original full-height panelling painted deep red on the dado with cream above;\u00a0basic bench seats with padded cushions are attached. The only changes are the removal of a small piece of the glazed partition near the servery, to which the landlord plns\u00a0to add a replacement; a bar counter was added in 1962 as the parquet floor indicates there was none there originally - but it is not clear whether there was previously a hatch. The 1950s looking brick fireplace was actually added in the 1980s by locals and has a log fire. The (now very modern) door between the two rooms could be explained by beer only being served in the snug which also acted as the jug and bottle prior to the counter being added in 1962.\n\r\nThe saloon bar on the right was originally the landlord's private parlour and just half its present size before being\u00a0brought into pub use in 1962, adding a small counter. In 1981 an extension was added on the right of the building to bring the toilets inside and doubling the lounge\u00a0in size. The present bar counter dates from\u00a01981 and the button leatherette fixed seating in bays must be from the same time\u00a0though\u00a0it does look very 1960s. The thickness of the wall confirms it was an exterior one.\n\r\nThe three real ales and cider are all fetched from the cask in the cellar so the handpumps are there 'just for show'.\"",

First, on the right, is the public bar which, until 1967, was accessed by a door in the middle of the frontage which also gave on to a tiny off-sales and the saloon - you can still see the old door behind the servery. The simple, slatted-wood counter and bar back shelving are from 1967. Ale is served from casks on two wooden stillages behind the bar. Note the old crib board screwed to the top of a scrubbed table. Other features are the portion of old dado panelling, an internal window to the corridor and a brick fireplace from which the plaster was removed fairly recently. \r\n\r\nTo the left of the corridor is the parlour, incorporated into the pub in 1980; a glass-fronted section of wall displays the underlying watlle & daub construction. The corridor turns 90 degrees; a small room at the back, also fairly new to pub use, has part-timbered walls and a hatch to the bar opposite. Finally we come to the saloon where the fittings are also from the 1967 changes, as is the extension into the former kitchen pantry (hence the old meat hooks in the beams) \r\n\r\nAccessed from stairs in the yard at the back is the superb barrel-ceilinged 'Long Room', believed to date from around 1790. This room, part of which sits above the saloon, has served many purposes from ballroom to courtroom to auction house and more recently a folk club and theatre. As assembly room for the local Conservatives, it also operated as a political and social arena and was the scene of a speech by Benjamin Disraeli, hence it being known as the Disraeli Room. It was refurbished in in 1980 and the superb moulding on the ceiling is a plaster replica from that time of the papier-mache original. Assembly rooms like this were once a common feature of coaching inns; most had a partition or movable doors enabling the space to be divided and the Bell's retains such a feature - and hence the fireplaces either end of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the left is a plain room with a few timbers and a glass-fronted section displaying the underlying wattle and daub construction. The corridor then turns 90 degrees and there\u2019s a small, room at the rear with part timbered walls and a hatch to the bar opposite it. The smoke room on the right has a counter and bar back shelves at least 40 years old; the room was extended to the rear in c.1968. At the rear is a 17th- or 18th-century building with an upstairs room which was used as a court house. Now called the Disraeli Room it was refurbished in 1980 and has a plaster ceiling which is an exact replica of the original old Papier-Mache ceiling.",

The rear area has plain match-board dado panelling and in the remains of the wall between the two parts is what looks like a tiny serving hatch. Prior to 1921 it is likely that the rear room was the kitchen and the front a dining room. Note the rare pub game of Ring the Bull at the rear. The two rooms on the right retains their original full height panelling and are now linked with a modern folding partition replacing the wall.

        "Description": "Although single roomed, this is a relatively unspoilt Victorian back-street local. The 'Jug And Bottle Department\" etched panel in the door indicates an off-sales has been absorbed into the bar. A lot of the fittings \u2013 bar counter, doors, windows, wall-panelling \u2013 are, if not original, then very old. As there is no door to the rear part of the bar it could this always been just one room since it became a pub? More research required. Interestingly, the gents toilets are inside but the ladies are 'outside' having been added at the back of the pub possibly in the 1930s or 1950s. It was in the Paul family from 1962 to 1998.",

It had a make-over in the fifties and a visit is a must to see a virtually intact design scheme which is a splendid survivor considering its town centre location. Various \u201colde worlde\u201d features were incorporated such as a brick fireplaces with medieval overtones, leaded windows and bench seats. The bar on the right has a fine stone-flagged floor and oak beams which are much older. The counter itself has old studded timber dividers infilled with (modern) brown tiles. The semi-circular bar has a pewter top and pewter handpump base - one of only half a dozen in the whole country. The brass inlaid cross keys on the lino floor as you enter date from the early 1960s. \r\n\r\nThe left hand lounge has a quarter circle bar counter of wood with brick infill and with a red Formica top. Note the two glass fronted display cases possibly originally used to store bottles of spirits. One of the diamond shaped leaded panels in the front left window has the initials 'RHJ + BB' and refer to previous licensees Reg & Brenda Johnson who ran the pub from 1961 to the 1980s - a local repaired the window 'for a drink'! \r\n\r\nHanging from the beams are numerous pewter mugs etc. on numbered hooks and there are lists of who owns them in frames on the wall.",

        "Description": "A gem of a small village pub which seems to have been refitted in a simple but elegant style in the later 1950s or 1960s. The sheer minuteness of this pub makes it a significant survival. The lack of recent\u00a0changes\u00a0is no doubt due to long serving landlady Mrs Judy Wilding who died February 2016 aged 95 and was probably the oldest licensee in the country. The pub has been run by a band of locals / friends for a number of year. There are two rooms, a cosy public bar and an even smaller lounge (the door between them has been removed and the opening has been slightly enlarged). It\u2019s the kind of pub where you are inevitably drawn into friendly conversation.\n\r\nOn the left the small lounge bar has a carpet, quarter circle bar counter which looks to be\u00a0from the 1950s and has a wooden top (was it changed from a Formica one?). There is a 1950s brick fireplace with an electric 'log' fire in front, fixed seating that looks just post-war and\u00a0a grandfather clock. Note\u00a0the very 1960s cool shelf in the bar back fitting.\n\r\nThe main but small public bar on the right has a panelled bar counter that is again probably from\u00a0the 1950s likewise the mirrored bar-back fitting\u00a0with Formica on a number of the shelves. Note the small till drawer hanging from the main shelf. Other features likely to be from the 1950s/60s refit are the\u00a0veneered wall panelling, wall benches attached to the front wall, a brick fireplace (with a log fire)\u00a0and a piano at the rear.",

From the front door there is an uneven brick-floored passage. Turn left and you find the splendid small Nelson's Bar, the historic core of the pub.  Originally there was no bar counter and drinks were brought from the cellar on a tray but, in 2002, a hole was cut in a wall to create a small counter to a new servery behind. At the same time, one of two ancient high-backed settles, attached to the ceiling with a curved iron rod, was removed. However, as part of further alterations in 2020, a replica of this settle was installed to accompany the splendid larger one. The original tiled floor was also replaced, the tiles being larger but still in keeping. \r\n\r\n To the right of the passage is the Ward Room, which up to the retirement of long-standing licensee Les Winter, founder member of the Nelson Society, in 1997, contained many items of Nelson memorabilia.  A small snug to the left of the bar was a cellar until 1994  - it also now has a modern tiled floo . \r\n\r\nThe Victory Room on the right was converted from a barn in 1996 but is now the kitchen. In 2020, the pub was hugely extended to the rear and this area contains the servery.",

It replaced the Manor House Hotel built in 1793 which, due to coastal erosion, fell to the beach in ruins in 1941. The main entrance is in a square two-storey tower adorned with curious panels inlaid with abstract patterns of flint, brick and stone. To one side is a tall, slim, oval sub-tower with the Lacon\u2019s falcon perched on top. The single storey flat roof bars are right and left, each with a veranda supported by brick pillars. Bar counter in bar on left is especially fine with brick and pebble inlays but, sadly, was covered in 2011 by new wood panels so can not be viewed at present. In the lounge both bar counter front and panelling on the walls are new (having replaced green plastic panels !), and the fixed seating in both bars looks like it has been replaced. \r\n\r\nRolling shutters separated the rear section of the right hand bar until they were removed in 2007 to make the room larger for its music events. Note the two small shutter covering hatches to the servery. The rear darts area in the bar may also been separated by rolling shutters in the past? The lobby retains its original basic bench used by children to sit while their parents drank in the bar! Gents retains it original 3 big urinals. The pub name relates to \u201cCaister Men Never Turn Back\u201d which led to the Caister Lifeboat disaster in 1901.",

There was a cabinet for a bar back which has since been removed and replaced by new shelves in the late 1980s. The only other change is the removal of the dark stain from the wood panelling to match the current vogue for bars with light pastel shades.\r\n\r\nThere was a lounge at the front of the building with a small counter but this was been converted to a bedroom in 2006.

Then in the early 1960s Watneys extended at the rear and created a public bar at the front, a lounge bar in the rear extension, a corridor linking them and also an off-sales on the front left. The only major change since then is the removal of the off sales in c.1990 which increased the size of the public bar. Most 1960s interiors have since been replaced making intact ones like this more rare than Victorian and inter-war ones! Other pubs in Norfolk which still retain 1960s bar fittings include the Wheel of Fortune, Alpington and West End Tavern, 1 Browne Street, Norwich. \n\nThe public bar has a Formica-topped counter, a 1960s bar back with a small cash drawer, and some unusual patterned-glass windows. In the corridor, note that the doors retain their room names in distinct Watneys red lettering \u2013 and whilst the ladies has been refurbished, the gents loos remain un-modernised with their original 1930s tiled walls. The lounge has a stripped pine wainscoting, with another Formica topped bar counter and 1960s bar back but, sadly, the small cash drawer has been removed in recent times. This is a very sports-oriented pub \u2013 even two pigeon clubs meet here. Maybe not of great architectural merit, it is a rare survival probably due to the last licensees running it for 25 years.

It led to the short passage between the two bars which may have had an off-sales hatch to the side of the bar now hidden behind ply panelled walls. The public bar on a lower level is virtually unaltered for 80+ years with its red quarry tiled floor, large fireplace with a tiled and cast fireplace added in the early 20th century. The old bar counter has a new top, there are some old bar back shelves on the left, rest are modern and old seating. There is a separate section for darts. The left hand bar has a modern tiled floor, old wood surround but new tiled fireplace, a small bar counter that looks like it replaced a hatch in c.1960 with a modern top. The dining room was formerly living quarters. Outbuildings have been converted to a pool room.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE June 2014. Fully renovated and extended, the tiled floor and the cast range remain but all other historic features have gone.",

On the right is a splendid small snug with more oak panels on the walls and a 1930s brick fireplace. Part of the snug is currently used for repairing clothes - sometimes for the customers! The small dining room on the rear left has a 1930s wood surround with new tiles fireplace and is served by a hatch/doorway.\r\n\r\nThe inn sign is a mural by John Moray Smith depicting one of the city gates. A Norwich based public artist, there are a number of examples of his work which included bas-relief panels. The most impressive is the five remaining of six panels celebrating the wool trade commissioned for Morgan's brewery in 1938 that form the bar back at the Woolpack, Golden Ball St. Also the colourful exterior sign at the Prince of Denmark and one at the Coachmakers, both Norwich.

In the 1970s the wall separating the off-sales and the snug on the right was removed. The public bar retains the original counter, bar back with old till drawer and a cigar cabinet with leaded windows. The original brick fireplace remains and in the mid 1980s panels were removed from either side of it to make access easier. To the left of the main bar a wall was removed in the early 1970s to link it with what is now a games room in the splendid circular tower-like section on the left of the building, which has its own entrance on the left side. \r\n\r\nYou will notice a small alcove just past the dividing wall - this was the original ladies which moved to the rear of the pub in the 1970s and involved shortening the original counter to what is now a small (disused) hatch. There is an original Tudor arch stone and brick fireplace in the games room. Note the decorative frieze of hops. The back door leads to an external staircase and at the bottom there is a loggia and extensive gardens to the River Wensum. A garden bar was added in the 1990s but is no longer in use.",

Opposite the front door is the separate off-sales with a '3' on the door and a red Formica top counter - intact off-sales like this are very rare. The former lounge on the left with a '2' on the door is now a games room which retains its 1960s counter with a red Formica top, classic 1960s bar back but the fireplace has been lost.

Prior to 1993 the Green Dragon had one of the most impressive historic interiors in the whole of Norfolk and even today is of significant 'true heritage' interest. The front door leads into a passage and at the rear is the distinct layout of a room split in two by a wooden partition forming settle seating and the tiny snug with a red quarry floor has an inglenook fireplace. There would have been hundreds of these snugs throughout England but the opening-up of the vast majority of them to create one large room makes the Green Dragon snug a remarkable survivor. Here the partition survives to the left and right but the central section which reached the ceiling was ripped out in 1993. A bench was added in 2004 across the missing section and so there is once again a tiny gap into the snug that is similar to the original one. The fireplace is a massive one of 1930s brick but the carved mantelpiece looks older and the latticed glass panels in the partition look like 1930s additions. \r\n\r\nThere have been recent changes to the bar itself - it was originally much smaller, more like a tiny servery with the handpumps on the back wall. Note the small door to the left of the fireplace with the words \"To The Abbey' which is a fine example of one of the biggest of all pub myths \"There is a tunnel to the, usually, the church from the pub cellar - behind the door is a....cupboard!! The bare wooden floored lounge at the front of the pub is now more of a dining room but originally was a shop. It has another 1930s brick fireplace and service via a tiny hatch cut into the door to the servery. Other 1930s changes include the adding of the ladies toilets - note the period 'Ladies only' illuminated sign. There is a figure '1' on the door to the cellar and '2' on the door to the bar. A third small room beyond the bar has been brought into use in recent years.",

Has been a pub since at least 1913, possibly Victorian times. It retains a rare original floor plan of two bars plus an off-sales between them and the little altered interior owes much to the pub being run by the same family since 1975. \r\n\r\nThe oddly shaped public bar is as a result it it being extended into private quarters in 1975. A hole / hatch was created in the wall that separated the left hand part of the public bar and a former living room now the right hand part of the public bar at that time. The wall was situated adjacent to the public bar door and so a private room was brought into pub use. \r\n\r\nThen in c.1976 it was decided to knock down the wall, which nearly doubled the size of the public bar, and also a staircase to the first floor was removed. Interestingly, it was decided to add a bar in the right hand part of the room so the section to the right of the main door only dates from c.1976 but looks almost identical - bar counter front and top - to the original on the left hand side. It is not easy to spot any difference. The metal post (or acro) was added at this time to hold up the ceiling. The public bar therefore retains a sturdy bar counter at least 70 years old, an old bar back shelving, old part panelled walls with benches attached (with post-war leatherette cushioning; possibly a fireplace has been lost. \r\n\r\nBetween the Public Bar and the Saloon Bar is the off-sales with its own entrance and is a rare survivor. An inner door with a sign 'Off Sales' leads to a tiny narrow room more like a passage with a dado of tongue and groove panelling. There is an old small bar counter with three handpumps and the part mirrored bar back is old with modern shelving added to the left. The off sales is still in use today mainly for confectionery, but occasionally for customers to fill a jug with cask ale - something you cannot buy at the supermarket! \r\n\r\nThe Saloon Bar on the left has more old tongue and groove panelling, an old bar counter, which in 1975 had a red Formica top - now wood, and an old mirrored bar back fitting; the pot shelf is an addition. On the left hand side of the room is a small illuminated display case which was originally a door to a gents urinal. The fixed seating is from post war times, the fireplace has been lost, and the alcove on the right is a bit of a mystery to the present tenants and may relate to when this building was originally three cottages.",

The bar counter is at least 70 years old as the photos in the snug show: the tongue and groove panelling (sadly painted gastro grey) and some of the bar back shelves attached could be of similar date. To the right past an ancient spiral staircase is a cracking little snug; one panelled wall looks post war. The dining room to the left has an impressive fireplace but almost certainly represents an extension into an adjoining property. Beyond this is another room brought into use - it has a brick floor, large old brick fireplace and an old corner cupboard. From the rear entrance there is an off-sales hatch to the back of the bar but this is no longer in use. Alongside it is the small bare boarded 'Chart Room' that was formerly the Stout & Oyster Bar, added in a 1950s flat room extension; however it is currently office space.",

        "Description": "Beautifully situated beside the Orwell estuary, the pub occupies a seventeenth-century building, extended in the nineteenth century plus two flat-roof extensions - the front one now part of the dining room was added in 1932; the rear one with the toilets is post-war. Featured in films and TV's Lovejoy (as 'The Three Ducks'!) this is a popular pub - at busy times use the pay & display car park half way up the hill. Its little-altered interior is as a result of being run by the Watts family from 1933 to 1988.\n\r\nThe red-tiled public bar with its two high-backed settles is especially attractive and has great views of the river from its bay window. It contains some seventeenth-century fielded panelling and an early twentieth-century brick and tile fireplace; some panelling looks as though it may date from the 1930s. The bar counter is hard to date; the stillage is still in use for cask beers (but nowadays for show with the actual casks in the cellar and beer dispensed via pipes through the tap), and the lower bar back shelves are also of some vintage. The only changes in the last 70-odd years have been the moving back of the bar counter some 18 inches in 1988 - careful inspection of the dado panelling and wear on the quarry tiled floor confirm this; and replacement of some of the upper shelving.\n\r\nAlso overlooking the river is the dining room, originally the second small pub room, which is double its original size due to the 1932 extension. It has another early twentieth-century fireplace and old fixed seating around the bay window in the front section but in 1997 a raised wood floor was added in the extension end and dado panelling and seating around the bay window is much more modern that in the first half of the room. Across a quarry-tiled corridor running through the pub is a small smoke room with a door and the figure '3' on it, bare wood floor, and over the brick fireplace is what the listing description describes as \"C17 carved panel with naively treated figures to sides and varied ornamentation\".",

        "Description": "An excellent example of how to expand a pubs trading area by  sympathetically creating new separate rooms. Up to 1982 the only public rooms were the public bar and the little used 'Men's Kitchen' behind. The bar retains its old counter front (new top), old basic red painted bar back shelves, red painted partition, bare wall bench seating attached to tongue and groove dado panelled walls and a brick floor. A wall to the left of the bar was removed in 1982 and the licensees private room on a lower level converted to a small quarry tiled floored area with a new small counter and wall bench seating / panelling added to match that in the original part. The games room beyond was originally a stable/barn. Behind the bar the flagstone floored former Men's Kitchen never had a bar (added in 1982). A photograph in the pub shows two large settles in this room which were removed by Adams before they sold the pub in the 1980s. It retains tongue and groove panelling on walls and ceiling. At the rear is a small 'Garden Room' built on in the early 1990s. The dining room on the far right was a store room.",

This has been a pub since at least 1869; part of the building was originally a shop which was incorporated into the pub early last century.  \r\n\r\nThe lower bar on the Lower Dagnell Street side has three (two disused) doors indicating it was formerly split into a bar, snug and off sales. The right hand door led to the off sales but the partitions were removed in the early 1960s and the bar here was changed as originally it went straight to the side wall where there is now a dart board. The off sales was only the width of the door and the black beams were added in the 1960s to strengthen the ceiling. Only a tiny part of the partition that separated the bar on the left from the snug on the right remains by the present entrance door. This bar has a wooden floor, distinctive 1950s style bar counter front, a 1950s (or older) bar back of shelves with mirrored panels and only one fridge has replaced some lower bar back shelving. The light-wood dado is old with wall benches attached and there is a 1950s brick fireplace; some panelling above the dado on the right hand side looks modern and the panelled ceiling is painted white.  \r\n\r\nA sliding door (always open) separates the small upper bar which has a panelled bar counter from the 1930s, a 1930s Art Deco brick fireplace now painted grey, old dado panelling with wall benches attached, a plain baffle and panelled ceiling painted white. Outside gents and ladies now under cover. Note the plaque on the pub which states \"The first branch meeting of CAMRA was held in this pub on 20th November 1972\".

In 1958 the room was extended back and new bar fittings added by Charringtons; panelling to match the 1930s ones were added to the rear section. The front left room with half timbered walls was the lounge bar until 1976 when the front door was blocked up and an old fireplace removed. The room is now used by diners but does retain the 1958 counter (the bar back looks more modern). There was a small snug which is now the first section of a further dining room but also has a 1958 bar counter.\r\n\r\nUpstairs the 'Room At The Top' is another dining room with one half timbered wall. Look for the hot cross buns hanging in the saloon bar which is a tradition started about 90 years old. Jack Turnell took over the Bell on a Good Friday and marked the occasion by hanging a bun from a beam. It's a tradition that has continued ever since - now the oldest person in the village (or at least the oldest available on the day) hangs the bun. The tradition even continued during the war - a concrete bun bearing witness to the shortage of food. In the same family ownership for 50 years.",

The bar counter is more like a hatch and is old, as indicated by the witness of two removed handpumps. \r\n\r\nThe right hand bar has a 1930s style fielded panelled counter and more old dado with seating attached. The brick fireplace is modern, as is the bar top; the carved bar back is not easy to date. A passageway runs down the rear and has a dado of old tongue and groove panelling. The left hand room did until recently have a door with a '3' on it and could have been the original cellar much is now part of the kitchen facilities. The kitchen on the right was once a pub room. There was a door on the far left with a sign 'Off Sales' which leads to the cellar, but this is no longer visible. \r\n\r\nIn the summer this pub with its seating area (was the pub car park) next to the sea front position is incredibly popular so they sell bottles from fridges including soft drinks and even wine from the left hand exterior door. There was a club room upstairs - the door is still there on the right hand side of the pub near the outside ladies' and gents'. Listed description states 'a first storey room has a good bolection moulded fire surround'.",

        "Description": "Large three-storey corner pub built c.1888 with painted-over exterior tiles. It features a colourful tiled wall, and also the biggest collection of Victorian back-painted mirrors in a pub that CAMRA is aware of. (There are other good displays of back-painted mirrors in the snug of the Half Moon, Herne Hill, London SE24  and on the left-hand wall of the Bunch of Grapes, Brompton, London SE3.) On the back wall of the main bar there are eight large and two small back-painted mirrors with plants, birds and a couple of rather delightful frogs, which are signed 'YOUNG & MARTEN, STRATFORD'. Sadly, the modern fittings in the form of two coolers and display shelves in front of them are truly crass. \r\n\r\nThe tiled wall with a pictorial panel is in a former entrance lobby - note the sealed-up outside door and the obvious opening-up of between the tiled area and the area with the mirrors. The floor-to-ceiling tiling features a multi-tile panel depicting a girl with a pail against a background of farm buildings and a few cows. It is signed 'L. Hall 1888'. The main bar consisted of at least two rooms in the past (note two exterior doors - one has 'Public bar' in etched glass) and retains its original bar counter and the ceiling is held up by two columns with decorative capitals. There is a separate small room at the rear also with an original counter and an internal porch with more etched glass. Southend's premier gay pub.",

The door to the left of the bay window with its etched and frosted 'Bar Parlour' window, a replacement of the original and fitted in the 1970s, leads into a small flagstone floored bar which was laid on top of the original brick floor in the 1970s. This splendid room retains an old counter, old bar back shelves, full height tongue-and-groove panelling throughout with bare benches attached and two old scrubbed tables; only the brick fireplace appears to be different. \r\n\r\nHistorically the pub consisted of the bar, an off-sales and a club room. The off-sales survived until the 1980s and was accessed via a door and ran down the left side of what is now the lounge, but was formerly the living room. The lounge has a good carved wood fireplace but the other fittings are modern. The former club room is now the small area at the beginning of the dining room at the rear right which retains an old brick fireplace.",

There are two short full height part glazed baffles as you enter the bare wood floored main bar. Prior to the 1960s there was two short partitions which formed a 'jug and bottle' with a small snug on the left and the public bar on the right. The Victorian panelled bar counter remains and has a number of brackets running all along its length, but the front has been shotblasted in recent years. In 1990 the counter was moved back about a foot  - look for the markings on the ceiling showing its original position. On the left the dado panelling has been painted cream, attached is original bench seating, and there is a post-war brick fireplace. On the right is more old dado panelling. \r\n\r\nThrough a doorway at the rear right and up a notable slope is a small room with a small piece of old dado panelling painted cream. This was a private living room until the 1980s and has a small counter added in 2020. The pub retains its outside toilets which are now accessed under a cover walkway.

        "Description": "Dating back to the early 17th century this pub has been in Mrs Barbara Greens family for over 40 years. It is included in this guide for its barely altered 19th century Tap Room on the front right hand side. There are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, Yorkshire, West;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; andAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nBuilt-in high backed bench seating forms a passage into a small quarry tiled floor room. It has basic bare seating attached to very old dado panelling all around the room, two old long tables with Formica tops added to them, and two basic low benches. Old brewery posters from Cannon, Taylor Walker and Benskins add to the atmosphere. There are only two minor changes to the room in over 100 years - as indicated in the 1940s photograph of the locals listening to a wartime broadcast hanging above it, the open fireplace has had a brick infill to reduce it to a standard grate; also a small hatch has been inserted for service to the bar. \r\n\r\nThe unusual shaped pieces of wood positioned between the mantelpiece and the ceiling look like the tilting devices for casks and would have been used in the cellar when beer was served from the cask and brought to your table in the past. (Or is a triple gun-rest!). The pub was extended to the left and rear in 1980 and the second original small room is one of three linked rooms all with new fittings. Two famous customers who would have known this room are Joachim von Ribbentrop and the spy Guy Burgess. The former was Nazi Germany\u2019s ambassador until 1938 and had a weekend home nearby at Latimer, while the latter made his last-known British appearance here in 1951 before defecting to the Soviet Union.",

Originally there were doors at the treat of both bars to the reception area but there is now a widish opening on the right hand side.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear there is a two part dining room and at the rear the oak panelled walls are much older and could date back many centuries; as does the large brick fireplace with a fine fireback. The unusual cut-out swing sign was designed by the architect J C F James and was exhibited at the Inn Signs Exhibition in 1936.",

To the rear of the Old Bar, in what is now the kitchen, there was originally two rooms - a domestic kitchen and 'The Keeper's Room', a private room only used by the estate keepers. The small room to the right of the entrance is the current public bar (also called the Shooting Room) which has a quarry tiled floor, however prior to the mid 1950s it was a domestic room and had a staircase where the servery is now situated which went up to the Club Room upstairs. The pub has been run by the same family since 1956 and just after this date they added the bar counter, mirrored bar back and moved the range fireplace from the old domestic kitchen to here and there have been no changes since. Further to the right a former barn was converted by Bullards Brewery in 1931 to a lounge bar which up to the mid 50s had a tiny bar with a Bakelite top. The present lapped wood counter and mirrored bar back were installed in 1957. In the late 1960s the former cellar was converted to what is a tiny bar now called the 'Cellar Bar', which is at ground floor level. All the other small rooms (11 rooms in total) have been brought into use in recent times. This pub is a model example of how to create more trading area in the most characterful of ways - a number of the walls are partitions that can be opened to amalgamate two or more rooms when required for larger functions.",

The two gents' toilets and the ladies, which is accessible from both bars, are the untouched original ones. The only changes have been the cutting of a narrow brick arch between the two rooms in the 1980s by the current landlord and replacement of an open fire by a tiled one in the lounge.

The bar counter is also the original one but with a new top as is the red and black diamond quarry tiled floor. The off sales was situated opposite the side door. Another small room to the right of the bar is also an original one. The pub has been much extended and refurbished but this does not impact on the old parts. The licensee also has an old Bullards metal sign depicting the stubby men, which is situated in his office. In Norwich city centre, the Walnut Tree Shades, Old Post Office Court near the Arcade also has a very old bar back with top panels of \"Brandies\" and \"Cigars\".",

It would appear two small rooms were combined in the 1930s and fielded panelling to 2/3rds height added throughout. The bar counter and most of the mirrored bar back with a set of drawers dates from the 30s as does the Tudor arch shaped wood surround of the fireplace (but the copper hood is possibly a 60s addition?). The public bar has been refitted in recent years but does retains a 'Bar' etched panel in the door and a parquet floor possibly of the 1930s. A third 'Garden Room' may well have been a pub room for some time but looks like it has been extended back. Service to it is from a hatch in the corridor. At the rear is a separate pebble fronted building now a function room/restaurant called the Stables which has its own modern bar.",

        "Description": "Re-built in 1931 in Tudor-style this attractive pub with a veranda was designed by Buckingham and Berry of Norwich for Steward & Patteson. It has three rooms and still retains many original features. On the left is an extension added in 1945/6 in a similar style to the original (the pub is reported as having been damaged by enemy action in 1940). The only recent change is the cutting of a doorway between the public bar on the left and the saloon bar on the right - until then you could only access each bar via its own front door. \r\n\r\nOn the right is the saloon bar with its original counter, fireplace and parquet floor. When built a wooden partition separated the saloon bar from the rear \u2018club room\u2019 (wording from the original plans which are in a frame on the wall). You can still see signs of where the partition ran and when it was removed in mid 1980s the timber was re-used for the present bar back fitting in the public bar. The former club room, now a dining area, is in \"Tudor hall\" style with a high ceiling and exposed timber beams. It has a magnificent full height chimney breast in brick and tile. \r\n\r\nThe public bar retains its original bar counter, unusually of brick with a wooden top, a brick fireplace, timber frieze, parquet floor and some original fixed seating. A brick arch from 1945/6 links the public bar with the left hand pool room, which was converted in the mid 1980s from the off sales / snug and a previously private room and has no old fittings. The small counter here replaced a hatch in the mid 1980s and the original door was where the dartboard is now.",

The snug is formed by a partition wall with low door and measures approximately 6 ft x 5 ft. The Free Press reopened in the late 1970s after a period of closure as the area around it was redeveloped. Practically all the fittings - bar counter, bar back, dado panelling with fixed seating attached and the fireplaces are 1970s direct replacements for the original ones, including those in the snug but some original material survives including the set of handpumps which date back to the 1940s, but a photo in the pub indicates they are not in their original position.\r\n\r\nThe layout changes include the removal of a wall that created the off sales alongside the snug - go outside and you can see the door has been blocked up - however, the two original swing seats still remain attached to the partition to the snug. Other changes include the amalgamation of the small right hand bar, which is served via a hatch, with the private sitting room behind which doubles the size of the room; and the creation of an opening between the two bars - the entrance to the right hand bar is no longer used. However, the outside toilets remain, albeit there is now a covered walkway between the pub and them.",

        "Description": "In the 1930s the Tollemache brewery of Ipswich underwent a large expansion and built a number of vast mock-baronial estate pubs which, due to their ornate style, and the scale of the expansion, led to their being known as Tolly Follies. They were based on the design of the Tollemache stately home, Helmingham Hall. The Golden Hind (built in 1936 by Caudey & Barefoot) is included because it is the least altered of these pubs - prior to a major refurbishment by Pubmaster in the 1990s it was virtually as built. (There is another Golden Hind on Milton Road, Cambridge which is identically built but it was totally refitted inside during the 1980s).\r\n\r\nIts external features include a clock tower (there is an appeal to restore it into use), 11 ornate chimneys and a large loggia at the rear.\r\n\r\nOn the right, a revolving door leads into a large space where the Oak Room and the room behind were made into one. Above the back section is an imposing oval shaped lantern skylight with four plaster reliefs representing the seasons; 12 individual flowers on another part of the Atrium representing the months of the year, 52 plaster flowers on the lower band and a row of leaded windows between the last two. On the right is the original staircase with turned baluster which leads to a large function room upstairs that retains two original fireplaces. Some of the fine oak panelling from the former Oak Room survives but the original bar has been replaced by a new one to the rear. Another door, on the left, leads to a further opened out area, this one L-shaped. Immediately ahead is an ornamentally screened cubicle with leaded lights; this originally shielded the off-sales though it is now difficult to work out how it was accessed. The bar fittings in this room are new and little of historic interest remains - just a little panelling near the pool table.",

There were changes in the 1950s when a small extension was added on the right for the toilets and lounge entrance.  \r\n\r\nThe present front bar with its red quarry tiled floor appears to have been barely altered since the 1950s when it was doubled in size by combining it with the former private living room - note the old lower panelled ceiling in the right half. The bar counter looks like a 1950s one and the bar back mostly 1950s with some modern additions. Old full height panelling on the right and modern dado panelling on the left has been painted beige and there is an old inglenook fireplace with a modern log burner.  \r\n\r\nThe rear lounge/dining room is small with a bare wood floor and very old inglenook fireplace with a copper hood. The small bar counter looks like a 1950s one and the bar back is a mixture of old and new. Recently modern dado has replaced older fielded panelling on the wall; a small cast fireplace in the corner indicates this was two rooms prior to the 1950s.",

Until 1945 the front left room was the bar served from a hatch, where the beginning of the bar is now. On the front right was the landlady's private lounge to which selected customers were invited. Then in  1945 a bar was fitted for the first time and the lounge was opened. Nothing changed until 1972 when Fullers added a second bar - note it is an exact copy of the first counter and bar back fitting; also a further small room at the rear was brought into use. However, a photo on the wall of the Cox family, who ran it into the 1950s, shows a different bar back fitting. Note the tiny till drawers in both of the bar backs - no modern till here! The fireplaces look to be of inter-war brick and date from 1945 and fixed seating could be of a similar date.",

At the end the corridor to the rear of the bar there is what looks like an off-sales sliding hatch in a 1930s looking screen but is more likely to be where the staff ordered drinks from when responding to the service bells which are near the fireplaces in all the small public rooms. Look at the beam to the right of the coach arch area and you will see a row of the original service bells.

Renovations were carried out in 1935 by Trust Houses when the half-timbering of the frontage were revealed after up to 100 years being hidden. Further changes took place in the early 1960s when much of the interior was reorganised. Before then, the front far left room was the public bar with access from the street; the near left was the dining room and the rear (now the bar) was the residents lounge. The changes saw the rear left room converted to the main bar and the front far left the lounge and it is unchanged since. In the bar, an impressive fielded panelled counter was installed along with bar back fittings in the same period style and including a counter/hatch to the lounge. Elsewhere are an old brick fireplace and moulded oak beams.; the room has been extended at the back, hence the change of level. In the two-part lounge the counter/hatch has a bar front from the 1960s alterations. In the former dining room, now part of the lounge, are deeply moulded oak beams, the main beam being supported on an upright at the top of which is a carving of a 'Wildman' or 'Woodwose'.  There is also a massive brick fireplace and a deep cornice all around the room. In the dining room to the right of the flagstone passage/hall are more oak beams and a glorious Elizabethan fireplace, some twelve-feet wide and spanned by a massive oak mantle beam, also delightfully carved.",

The bar back fitting looks more modern than old (mirrors inserted in 2005), but the lower half could be old. The small smoke room also has more panelling painted grey and brick fireplace. On the left the lounge with a good external porch has been knocked through to the far left dining room with a large fireplace from the 1970s. The single storey building to the left of the pub is part of the council swimming baths.",

The public bar at the front is little-changed apart from absorbing the off-sales - originally the counter was further forward and you can see the line of it in the floor and note the fixed seating closest to the counter on both sides is different to the rest of the seating. Retains original counter front albeit reduced in size and re-positioned c.1990, fixed seating, panelling and fireplace. In the lounge / smoke room there is a 1926 tiled and wood surround fireplace but the room is a combination of the lounge and cellar behind and there are modern bar fittings. It has been extended to the rear to create a dining room. Note the colourful 'Smoke Room' and 'Club Room' stained glass windows - the club room was upstairs - now the licensees living room. Closed Mon to Fri lunchtimes - opens at 7 (12 Sat, Sun).  \r\n\r\nIn Gorleston the Three Tuns, 247 High Street still retains two curved bar counters installed c.1960 with Formica & wood tops and panelled counter front with leatherette sections between the 1950s style uprights. The only remaining Victorian fittings are the colourful tiled floor between the servery and the odd etched window. The main bar lost its fine original counter in 1993.",

There is a wonderful Lacon's tiled fireplace featuring lines of cask and Lacons's falcon tiles down each side and the dado panelling looks 1950s.

Despite changes there are a lot of original fittings in the present two main bars but the saloon bar counter and bar back are not in their original position.  \r\n\r\nThe left door leads to a small lobby with a terrazzo floor and beyond is the present saloon bar which is an amalgamation of the original saloon bar (on the left), off license and snug. The left part of the room has fielded panelling on the walls to picture frame height and the original Tudor shaped stone fireplace but it has lost its brick interior and now houses a wood burner. The wooden seating bays are a modern addition as the old photographs show loose seating but they do not detract from the overall feel of the room. On the right at the rear of the room is the original bar counter and bar back (wood is the same style as on the panelling) but it was originally positioned in the wide gap between the two halves of the room - the photo on the wall shows there was a panelled wall on the right of it and two windows i.e. the front ones. The right hand are of the room originally contained the off license and the snug - there are three doors into the present saloon bar.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar is accessed via the door on the right leading to a small lobby with terrazzo floor.

        "Description": "This brick and Norfolk carrstone building was purchased from the local Bagges Brewery by Steward & Patteson in 1929 and shortly afterwards was extended to the right and refitted by them. The public bar on the left has a bare wood floor, a sloping to you bar counter that looks very 1930s but may be a replacement, the bar back is a mixture of 1930s and more modern, some 1930s bench seating and a 1930s brick fireplace. There is a dado of 1930s panelling and where a section of the bench seating has been removed at the front of the room it is painted cream. The lounge on the right is completely covered in 1930s wall panelling which indicates the room has been this size since c. 1930. The bar back fitting is the 1930s one with a mirrored back and the bar counter is also from that time. The fielded panelled door has a glazed panel in the top, a good high backed bench as you enter, and the seating could be from the 1930s. There is a 1960s looking fireplace on the far right with a built-in clock above it. It has lost an off-sales hatch between the two rooms.",

        "Description": "Built by Bullards in 1934 and little altered but it is for sale by Punch Taverns as 'alternative uses' / 3 building plots so visit it soon. Some reclaimed doors and windows from the old City Hall were incorporated into the building. Built of brick with mock Tudor first floor it has decorative wooden brackets holding up the protruding first floor windows. Originally built with outside toilets, extensions added later to bring then inside and the front porch is also a later addition. Some of the leaded windows have random colour glass panes. It still retains three distinctive rooms but gaps were cut into the dividing walls in the 1970s and a former living room on the far left has been brought into use as a public room accessed via doorway sized gaps either side of the fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe left hand bar looks like it could have been the off-sales and a bar as there is what looks like a former door with the figure '3' on the inside on the right as well as an active door to the left with the figure '4' on the inside. This small room has a bare brick dado, original curved brick counter front with a wooden top, and a  large 1930s brick fireplace, All around the room is a colourful decorative plaster frieze of a floral design. \r\n\r\nThe main bar in the centre also has an original brick counter front with wooden top, note the 1930s fielded panelling on the door for staff here. The room also has a colourful decorative plaster frieze of a floral design all around the walls. There is no figure on the inside door but note the decorative door hinges. The bar back is mainly modern but the odd shelf may be old and there is some 1930s fielded panelling within the servery. A widish doorway gap leads to the room on the right with another original curved brick counter front with a wooden top, a bare brick dado, the figure '2' on the inside of the door and a colourful decorative plaster frieze of a floral design all around the walls. The door to the cellar has a figure '5' on it. The doors to the gents and ladies' are original.",

The present public bar retains much of its interior fittings but has absorbed the off-sales - note the original door on the exterior. The public bar has some half timbering on the walls and good plasterwork decoration in the frieze area. The bar back fitting is the original with fridges replacing most of the  lower shelving. The bar counter is the original with leatherette padded panels added to the front in the 1960/1970s, and a new top from the same time; also it has been re-positioned further back as the area for staff was much bigger originally. \r\n\r\nOn the far left is what is now a pool room with some more of the half timbering on the wall but has lost its fireplace. The door to the toilets is original but the gents and ladies have been modernised. Note the 'Tattersalls Lounge' sign above the servery with both Whitbread and Lacons symbols. On the right the lounge appears to have been two rooms (or room extended to the right?) changed in the 1970s and most of the fittings appear to be from this date with just the half timbering on the wall being original. There are colourful stained and leaded exterior windows featuring the Lacons falcon in two windows in both the right hand lounge and left hand pool room.\r\n\r\nA renovation in 2016 has seen the lounge fixed seating re-upholstered and the coloured pargetting painted plain white.",

Despite closures and refurbishments there is much to admire internally. The front door leads to a lobby with screen that indicates the present public bar was originally two separate rooms (possibly two rooms and an off sales?) and confirmed by the two impressive fireplaces. The bar counter front looks like the original as it matches the wood in the front screen with its diagonal motifs but the top is a replacement and the bar back fitting is modern.\r\n\r\nThe two huge fireplaces have Tudor arch shaped stone surrounds with a 1930s brick interior then a row of three classic 1930s brick patterned features in a timber strip and above are three Masonic shields \u2013 the RGC one refers to R G Carter the builders of many pubs for Bullards Brewery. On the left through a wide doorway is a splendid high ceilinged Baronial hall-style dining room where the 1930s brick fireplaces chimney breast reaches the ceiling; it has a parquet floor. The rear area of the pub has all modern fittings including a reproduction of the original public bar counter front. Originally built with outside toilets, the present gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 on the front right was formerly a small smoke room. The former separate function room at the rear is now an Indian takeaway, a separate business.",

From the front door in a small room down two steps on the right is the original bar which retains an old bar counter and also on the left wall old lower bar back shelving. A photo on the wall shows there was old shelving on the left and right, and glazing above the left shelves so the old looking back fitting at the rear is modern. The room has old dado panelling with bare benches attached to it at the front including around the bay window. Old scrubbed top tables add to the atmosphere as does the log fire in the modern fireplace. A doorway to the right leads to the snug, a bare wood floored small room with a Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace. At the rear right is another small room that was the private living room in the past and has a Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace and old wall cupboards. \r\n\r\nUp to 2000 there was a flat roofed extension that looked like it had been added by Watneys/Bullards in the 1960s - now a flint walled one has replaced it.

The two settles which are fixed to the ceiling with iron stays are believed to date from 1840, or possibly earlier, making them some of the oldest pub fittings we have featured in this series. Sadly they have been reduced in width to make a wider passageway into the room.

The room is two-part with a central fireplace and on the right the former living room was taken into public use about 40 years ago and is now a dining area.

The largish brick fireplace is old (now with a log burner) - note the old fire (insurance) plaque on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe front door leads into a very small low beamed public bar with a red tiled floor. The bar counter here looks like it was added in the early 1960s and is of brick with three wooden supports and wooden top, and the bar back shelving is also post-war. The small brick fireplace looks like a 1960s replacement with a copper hood and signs of an old oven on the left. \r\n\r\nLeft of the main bar is a tiny snug with just one small table and a beamed ceiling. On the far left is an open rafter ceilinged dining room with a fine old brick inglenook fireplace with a chimney that reaches to the roof.

This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\r\n\r\nBuilt by Tolly Cobbold to a typical design for its time which, according to the pub\u2019s landlady, was opened on 22 November 1963, the day that President Kennedy was assassinated. Named in honour of the town\u2019s horse-racing associations, it is of brick \u2013 two storey on the roadside and single storey at the rear which houses a large lounge bar / function room. This may be the most intact Post-War pub left in England as a result of research by Historic England still retaining without change it layout of public bar (Circus Bar), lounge bar / function room and its off-license which is still in daily use. This is no doubt due in part to the long serving landlady, Sheila McNally, who has been there since 1988, and who still keeps traditional pub hours (but usually open all day on Sunday). \r\n\r\nOn the left a door leads to a lobby with intact gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets off. A door on the right leads to the public bar, called the Circus Bar \u2013 note the two circus themed murals above the servery. It is carpeted with tiles in front of the counter. The bar counter has a front of cream Formica with a row of seven portrait shaped \u2018features\u2019 of red Formica in wooden frames and a top of black Formica. The bar back fitting is of classic late 1950s / early 1960s design with at the top three illuminated panels (not lit but still work) advertising \u2018Cobnut\u2019, \u2018Tolly\u2019, and \u2018Cardinal\u2019. Two of the three bays have plain mirrors with optics on a wooden strip across them and the lower shelving includes a cool tray (no longer in working order) and just one fridge added. The room retains its original upholstered bench seating at the front, 1950s style dado panelling on the right hand wall and more panels on the ceiling on this side of the room. The left hand wall is of bare brick with a wood surround fireplace that has been covered by ply panels for at least 30 years and a dartboard above. There is a piano (not played) and two trophy cabinets high up on the wall. \r\n\r\nThe lounge bar/function room has a separate double door entrance on the right hand side. This large room has a dance floor on the right / far end (pool table is moved when the room is in use for a function) and carpet elsewhere. In the middle of the left hand side of the room is an original free standing buffet with red Formica top and sides matching the bar counter front with red padded panels \u2013 it is still in regular use for buffets for functions \u2013 Sheila advertises \u2018Free Function Room\u2019. Every Tuesday the lounge bar/function room hosts Bingo from 8.30 pm with about up to 65 people attending. The room retains its original upholstered bench seating in bays. On the rear wall there were originally murals of palomino horses but these are now covered (date unknown) by two areas of diagonal shaped mirror tiles. The bar counter has a front of wood painted black and red padded panels all along it and a brown Formica top. The bar back fitting has two bays of mirror mosaic with optics on a wooden strip across them and in the centre diagonal shaped mirror tiles; the lower shelving includes a cool tray (no longer in working order). Note the doors throughout the room with their suns rays decoration in cream on red. \r\n\r\nOn the corner between the two rooms is the off-sales which is operational for all the pub\u2019s open hours and although quiet at lunchtimes it is used in the evenings as the store in the adjacent contemporary shopping parade shuts at 6 pm. A bell on a metal coiled spring on the back of the door announces your entrance. The original counter has a front of ply panels and a black Formica top. The bar back fitting is of simple wooden shelves with the main shelf being of black Formica. There are two shop windows and the cupboards and sliding ribbed glass panes for changing the displays are all still intact. It is well stocked with wines, spirits, soft drinks, sweets, crisps etc.",

        "Description": "Two-storey building of brick and render with tiles on the ground floor. It was built in 1953 designed by Sidney C Clark for Charringtons Brewery. It was the second pub opened in Harlow New Town and is the earliest there to survive intact (the Essex Skipper, of 1951, has been internally altered). This is one of the earliest newly built post-war pubs in the whole country and amazingly remains remarkably intact with its two bars, off sales and lots of original fittings.\n\r\nThe Public Bar (originally the Saloon Bar) on the left retains its door but the baffle just inside is modern as the photo on the wall confirms it was not there when the pub opened. There are another two modern baffles by a door on the Ward Hatch side which was there originally but now is only for access to the outside smoking area. The counter is the original situated on a tiled plinth with an inlaid top and curved at both ends but it has modern mouldings applied over the front of it and looks very inter-war in style. The bar back is original with some modernisation \u2013 note the \u2018Charringtons\u2019 wording at the top which was illuminated in the past. The tiled fireplace is a replacement, and panelling has been taken off the far/east wall. Fixed seating is modern as none in the photo of the pub just after it opened (not surprising for what was a saloon bar); the photo shows a terrazzo floor now covered by a carpet. Also, the photo shows that the vents (visible in the other bar) have been covered over in this bar. There is a small stock room/office on the east side of the severy, between the counters and the gents. It has an original glazed partition dividing it from the servery of the former public bar, covered over on the bar side.\n\r\nThe Saloon Bar (originally the Public Bar) on the right has a counter that is original, but modern mouldings have been applied over the front of it and it is also on a plinth. The bar back has at the top another \u2018Charringtons\u2019 wording no longer illuminated and some shelving could be old. The room has a panelled dado and curved panelling on top of the left and right sides of the counter all of which is very 1950s. The vents above the counter are still there. Originally there was a separate small room accessed via a door at the centre of the rear part of this bar \u2013 you can clearly see the ceiling coving stops before it and there are no ceiling roses in the rear section. In the late 1980s (?) the partition between the two spaces was taken out and the (former) public bar extended to the rear, the extra space possibly being used for games. It is not clear what the small room was for originally (it was a cleaning cupboard by the early 1980s).\n\r\nThere is a walkway between the two bars with the gents\u2019 toilet off \u2013 there are modern tiles in the toilets and on the walkway walls. The ladies are, respectively, in small out-shuts on the outer sides of the two bars, and are completely original. The middle door on The Chantry side is to the off sales which remains but is now used for storage. Prior to a repainting in c.2020, the\u00a0inn sign was\u00a0different on each side\u00a0\u2013 all pubs built in Harlow were named after butterflies and moths and a white admiral was illustrated on one side but on the other it was\u00a0a sea lord.",

The bar counter is old and matches the position shown in the plan, there is a large old brick and wood surround fireplace and old panelling on the walls. In the rear area there is more wall panelling, a blocked up 1930s brick fireplace and a wall bench down the right hand side which looks old. \r\n\r\nIn the middle of the pub in what was originally an off sales (look for the disused door with a figure \u20184\u2019 on it) and a tiny snug there is a very small bare boarded bar with a counter that looks to be in the original position and perched on top of it is a set of three modern snob screens. There is no bar back fitting as such anywhere in the pub just some modern shelves. \r\n\r\nWhat was originally the private bar and, in the single storey part on the far left, a parlour is now a single room with bare wood floor on the right and brick floor on the left. The counter here is clearly an addition but the tiled and wood surround fireplace on the rear left looks to be from the 1930s and some dado panelling may be old.",

It lies at a point where several roads meet and its flanks are cranked backwards to follow the lines of the adjacent roads. The interior, like the external architecture, is simply and cheaply done but has not been completely opened out. The least altered part is in the centre with a long straight servery and two rooms of differing sizes. \r\n\r\nThe left-hand one of the pair has veneer wall panelling which also appears on the bar counter and elsewhere. The bar-back is original but, like the rest of the work, is simple and functional. On the far left-hand side is what is now a games room but this would, no doubt, originally have been a lounge. A similar room lies on the right-hand side but this has been completely modernised and turned into a restaurant area specialising in excellent Indian food. In turn this area has been knocked into a further space beyond which is thought to have been an off-licence shop linked to the pub.",

        "Description": "Recently lightly redecorated with no changes to the original fittings - a model example on how to bring a pub up to the high standards liked by customers but respecting the historic interior.\n\r\nThe Express was rebuilt in mid-Victorian times and old photographs show three original entrances. The sole entrance now leads into the right hand bar with a doorway (with no door) to the left-hand room. Sadly, the full height partition\u00a0with a mixture of Victorian and (perhaps) 1930s glazing that formed a vestibule just inside the front door has been removed. The right-hand room retains its original bar fittings but it was originally a much smaller room. It's now L-shaped since some rearrangements in 1994 when a partition that created a tiny private bar on the right hand side was removed. This was accessed from the now blocked in right hand door. Also, the bar counter was moved back in order to create a larger drinking area - you can see where the counter in this room is misaligned where it meets that of the left hand bar. At the same time, in order create a doorway to the former tiny landlord's parlour at the back, a three to four feet section of the bar-back that was beneath the clock on the right was removed; and the bar counter in front of it cut short so that there is now no counter in front of it. This doorway to the former landlord\u2019s parlour has a fascinating double-sided clock over it, surrounded by brown painted and gilt glazing bearing the name of the pub. This decoration suggests a date of about 1870 and, if so, then perhaps we have here some of the earliest surviving pub fittings in London. Note the large ceiling rose and frieze now painted black.\n\r\nThe left-hand room has a fine marble fire surround fireplace, original fixed seating and original counter. The third room behind was remodelled in Tudor style in 1932 judging by the date scratched on a ceiling beam (now not visible - probably beneath the grey paint that we see so often in pubs). This room has seen the most recent change with fresh fixed seating and partitions with good modern stained and leaded panels, but the 1930s brick fireplace on the left is now hidden behind the seating. Another sad loss in this room is the removal of the door to the serving area with the little peep-hole in it, apparently used to call for drinks when the room was in use for private functions - for example, meetings of the brethren of the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes whose horns still hang proudly over the opening to the left hand bar.\nOperated by owners of Big Smoke Brew Co., it sells a large range of real ales. On the exterior note the ancient 'Draught' 'Bass'\u00a0advertising (illuminated at night) a beer that the pub still sells.",

        "Description": "There was a pub here called the Prince Frederick\u2019s Head in 1761, just ten years after the death of the eponymous prince. The present building is Victorian and, importantly, it was revamped in the 1930s giving it the appealing character it has today. The two front bars were divided by a wall with a narrow pair of doors allowing access from one side to the other but this was removed in 2015 so the pub is now a series of areas. At one time there must have been an off-sales compartment between the two parts, as suggested by the now disused doorway in the frontage. Both parts have three-quarter height wall panelling and distinctive white Vitrolite ceiling panels. \nOn the left-hand side is an attractive dark blue tiled fire surround. The bar counters are plain match-boarded affairs and, as such, difficult to date (they might be later than the 1930s but it\u2019s hard to see why they should have been replaced). The mainly modern bar-back, while of a distinct 1930s design the glazed advertising panels at the top are clearly modern in an old style. The rear part is a flat-roofed extension, no doubt, of the 1930s and also has extensive panelling which has been painted a \u2018gastro grey\u2019 colour in recent times and the interwar fireplace blocked-up. The small bar counter front is painted a \u2018gastro grey\u2019 colour; there seems to have been some opening up in this area.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nThis Victorian corner-site Charrington\u2019s pub was given a thorough, if rather plain, refit in the 1930s. The mottled beige tiling applied to the ground floor exterior is still there behind a layer of paint that someone has shortsightedly applied. Inside, the work fares better with three separate rooms still with their 1930s fittings. At the front lie the public bar and a smaller snug, both accessed from a common, promontory servery. This has a central fitting with plain mirrors in the panels, and attractive lettering at the top advertising Charrington\u2019s wares \u2013 Toby Ale and Toby Stout (Charrington\u2019s emblem was a Toby jug). The snug is the most intimate part of the pub and is nicely fitted out, as is the public bar, with wall panelling decorated with concave vertical strips. At the rear is a large lounge, much bigger than the front area. The servery extends back into it and the Charrington\u2019s advertising reappears with the blandishments of \u2018wines and spirits\u2019 and \u2018barley wine\u2019. The walls are divided up by wooden strips into large vertical panels.",

        "Description": "An imposing Edwardian corner pub of 1902 by architects W E Trent and Henry Poston for one Joseph Hill. It is a lavish architectural display with a corner turret and a couple of first floor balconies. Though rather dilapidated, it retains three distinct areas gathered round a central servery. The large room fronting High Street North is split by a timber and glass screen but originally it would have been further subdivided \u2013 see the multiple doors from the rather grand, mosaic-floored entrance and the changes in bar counter design.\r\n\r\nThe least-altered part is the delightful private bar off Romford Road \u2013 currently used for storage but retaining its fittings, even down to a glazed display cabinet. Behind comes a large, dark area, probably once a billiard room, with a blocked skylight and deep cornice. The original servery fittings include an unusual bar-back with sub-Jacobean detail, built-in clock and mirrored panels. There is also good ceiling decoration, a little etched glass and three very striking fireplaces. These latter break with the tradition of ornate Victorian or Edwardian work and their clean lines would not be out of place in a building 25 years later.",

        "Description": "Rebuilt by Truman\u2019s in 1929 when they purchased the cottage next door \u2013 hence the numbers \u201924-6\u2019 in relief on the fascia. With the surrounding housing vanished, thanks first to Hitler and then the even more energetic post-war planners, it looks strangely adrift in a green area beside the Regent\u2019s Canal. The exterior has buff and mottled grey-blue ceramic work and also displays Truman\u2019s proud eagle. Inside there are still two completely separate rooms. The corner one was originally further subdivided into two small bars and an off sales \u2013 note the three doors. It has a particularly attractive sweeping hemispherical end to the bar counter like a Scottish island bar particularly as there is a delicate \u2018gantry\u2019 in the centre, which was sadly shortened in 1977. At the rear is the original wood surround fireplace. \n\nThe right hand room, which is only open in the evenings, was intended to be the smarter area of the pub as can be seen by the rather finer detailing of both the dado and the curved counter (panelled as opposed to upright tongue-and-grooved work). Both counters have before them the typical Truman\u2019s tiled chequerwork and both also have openings for access to the beer engines. On the right-hand side it looks as though the cover over the East London Fives dart board might be a survivor from the 1930s. There is another original wood surround fireplace with a gas fire in front, a shallow vestibule but the skylight has been covered over and the pot shelf is modern. The loose furniture is worth a look for some attractive benches on the right-hand side and the 1930s tables in both bars. Those in the corner bar have unusual cork tops, as does the counter on the right-hand side. \n\nUntil 1977 there was an office behind the bar where originally bar staff would take the customers' money and receive change. It was situated where there are three modern sections of bar back fitting on the left (right two sections are original) \u2013 part of the cut glass has been preserved in a frame over the right hand side fireplace. The pub\u2019s loos on the right side are intact with dados of cream and some brown tiling, red tiled floor and original fittings. As there was no ladies\u2019 toilet on the bar side one was added in 1977 by making the gents\u2019 smaller.",

        "Description": "This three-storey Victorian corner-site pub dates back to the 1860s when the area was being developed. It was given a major makeover in about 1935 which is what forms the real interest today. The ground floor received a grey granite facing and the whole interior was refitted. Entering from the Blurton Road side, the bar there is notable with characteristic two-thirds-height panelling and a large circular feature for concealed lighting. The counter steps forward in three stages. The bar-back and fire surround are from the same scheme but the overmantel has been altered. There are beautifully veneered doors to the loos and the lettering over is probably original. The ladies\u2019 has been refitted but the gents\u2019 has its original tiling although some TLC is perhaps needed to recapture the true spirit of the 1930s. \n\nThe other, larger bar, now accessed through a walkway, has much less of interest and is partly old \u2013 such as the bar counter and herring-bone woodblock floor \u2013 and partly new. Markings on the floor clearly show that there was once a small, separate compartment: perhaps this was an off-sales area but quite how it linked to the servery is unclear.",

        "Description": "A pub built in two parts \u2013 a late 19th-century building on the corner by Fredk Ashton (sourcs Pevsner London East, uncorrob) and a major extension of 1903 along High Street North. What makes this pub is special is the upper floor \u2013 ring ahead to arrange a visit at a quiet time \u2013 where the former billiard room has a stunning skylight, a screened servery, and walls lines with mirrors etc. \n Downstairs what was the at least a separate public bar and saloon (note the wrought iron \u2018Saloon\u2019 above the entrance on High Street North) Above this entrance is a shield with \u2018The Denmark Arms\u2019 in stone relief with carved figures either side. The large almost an island bar counter looks to be from the inter-war period with its red melamine top and sitting on a plinth. The bar back, which faces three directions, looks a mixture of inter-war work and part modern with the middle section lost to tall fridges. There is a good corner vestibule with etched and frosted glass panels at the top. \r\n\r\nOn the left of the room is the staircase from the street to the first floor and on this encased area is a wide decorative frieze with tendrils swirling round stylised rosettes \u2013 recently painted cream (previously red). This frieze continues down the left hand wall and the dado here has plain green tiles and some with statuesque rose bushes in relief. Between the tiles and frieze is a mottled alabaster band. A widish gap leads to the rear area \u2013 the former saloon in the newer part of the pub. Here the ceiling is divided into bold panels with deep cornices and a high-level frieze featuring caryatids. The columns in the two areas are also different \u2013 thin Corinthian ones in the older area, chunky Ionic ones in the newer. There are two marble surround fireplaces with modern tiled interiors and tall mantelpieces with plain mirrors. \n Upstairs is now used as a function room. Originally it was two rooms \u2013 the front part a restaurant with its entrance from Barking Road and also a function room (originally a billiard room) with its own separate entrance on High Street North above which is a sign in stone relief \u201cDenmark Arms Hotel Luncheons & Lounge\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe front section upstairs has on the right 5 and on the left 4 large mirrors above a mahogany dado and surround with (rosebud?) decoration between them. A folding partition can separate the two parts. At the rear is the impressive former billiard room with an elaborate ceiling topped with a skylight having painted glass panels. There are more of the large mirrors above a dado on three sides. On the right hand side is a (disused) screened servery which looks like it was an inter-war addition \u2013 all the glass panels remain including the ones that can be raised. \r\n\r\nThere are other good examples of (former) billiard room skylights at Boleyn Tavern, East Ham E6; \u2013 possibly the finest of them?; Salisbury N4; Great Northern Railway Tavern, Hornsey; and Duke of Sussex, Chiswick.",

        "Description": "The Griffin we have today is actually two buildings that have been knocked into one pub. The older part stretches down Ravey Street and has some typical detailing from about 1870. The later part, on the corner, has some distinctive tiled panels and dates from c.1899. Then, between the wars, along came the brown tile refacing of all the ground-floor walls by Meux\u2019s Brewery to promote their wares \u2013 they brewed on the site of the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road until 1921, then moved to Nine Elms where brewing ceased in 1964.  \r\n\r\nAll the internal partitioning has gone but the long Victorian counter remains, as does the match-board panelling that covers the ceiling. But the feature of most interest is the seven bay back fitting behind the bar with a series of unusual, highly ornamented wooden columns with capitals picked out in gold, a number of original mirrors including ones with wording \u201cEast London Liquer Co.\u201d; \u201cGriffin Tavern\u201d; \u201cDrew & Sons Biscuits Steam Works Shadwell\u201d; \u201cMartell & Hennessey Brandies\u201d. and a fancy cornice above. Fridges have replaced lower shelving.  \r\n\r\nIn what was previously a separate room at the rear there are three inscribed mirrors advertising \u201cFinest Scotch Whiskies\u201d; \u201cClarets of the Finest Vintage\u201d, \u201cPorts of the Leading Shippers\u201d - the left one looks much older than the other two which may be later reproductions?  \r\n\r\nThus pub closed in 2014 for conversion of the top two floors to residential which included the loss of the former function room on the first floor. The pub reopened in 2016 with most wooden surfaces painted a deep green colour.",

        "Description": "The Lamb is at the heart of the echoing splendour of Leadenhall Market, rebuilt in 1880-1 to the designs of Horace Jones, architect and surveyor to the City of London. Once bustling with market traders, porters and their customers, the market is now more a series of gentrified boutiques but its pub is still a vibrant place to visit. Apart from the architecture, there are several historic features. The external glazing has lots of etched glass including a large corner panel with the words \u2018W Pardy Wine and Spirit Merchant\u2019 and door glass naming the former rooms within.\n\nJust inside the right-hand doors is a large tiled panel from the prolific firm of W B Simpson & Son, helpfully dated March 1889. As the inscription says, it shows Sir Christopher Wren in 1671 explaining (for some reason best known to him) his plans for the Monument to those gathered around, including a puzzled lady in a carriage attended by her black servant boy. The cellar bar is a warren of spaces under depressed, red-brick jack-arches and is notable for its cream and green tiling. The rest of the fittings and arrangements are modern, including the mezzanine floor.",

        "Description": "A well-known institution in lower Fleet Street (but avoid frenetic weekday lunchtimes when you are more or less expected to buy food). It could easily be missed were it not for Mr Punch outside and lavish tiling to the entrance as it lies up a corridor behind a couple of shop fronts. The pub is part of a block built in 1894-7 by architects Saville & Martin and at one time also incorporated the pub round the corner in Bride Lane, the Crown & Sugar Loaf. The entrance corridor is unlike anything else in a London pub and has extensive tiling, a mosaic floor, mirrors and, either side of the inner doors, large canvas paintings of a very sinister looking Mr and Mrs Punch (signed by W B Simpson\u2019s who were no doubt responsible for the whole decorative scheme).\n\nInside there has been a good deal of rearrangement and refitting and it is now impossible to work out exactly how things might have been. The fixed seating on the left-hand side seems original and the lovely etched main panels in the bar-back also no doubt date from 1894. But the collection of glass in the lower part of the bar-back has clearly been shuffled. The two skylights in this room add much to its character. \n\nThe rear room was a bookshop until the 1990s and was brought into use after the Punch separated from what is now the Crown & Sugar Loaf. Here the Yorkshire brewer, Samuel Smith has recreated a fabulous Victorian-style interior in modern times. They brought the pub back to life in June 2004 with a stunning display of etched and cut mirrors, carved woodwork, a marble counter and lovely mosaic floor. The decorated ceiling is the only original Victorian feature but no matter \u2013 the whole thing is done with such fantastic panache.",

        "Pub Name": "Tipperary",
        "Address": "66 Fleet Street, London, Temple, EC4Y 1HT",
        "Description": "Claimed as London\u2019s first Irish pub, the Tipperary was taken over by Mooney\u2019s of Dublin in 1895 who promptly demolished it and rebuilt the present small establishment in the late 19th century under architect R L Cox. You will spot the Mooney\u2019s lettering at the front doorstep with mosaic edging in the inner porch. A pair of doors in the full height glazed screen leads into a single, narrow long bar on the ground floor stretching away from the street that was once lined with boozy newspaper reporters.  \n \nA shamrock-embellished mosaic runs down the right-hand side floor in an attempt to establish the Irish credentials. A fielded panelled bar counter is situated on the left but the line of the mosaic floor indicates the original bar stretched virtually to the inner doors and was curved here and also ran to the rear door but nowadays there is a small snug area between the end of the counter and the rear door. The carved bar-back also appears to have run to the end of the room as there are remains of three bays in the snug area. Greene King publicity states that they \u2018refitted the interior to the style of Mooney\u2019s days\u2019 and adds \u2018all the panelling, fixtures and fittings have been retained\u2019. It is likely, therefore, that the counter was shortened (and part moved upstairs as it matches it) or the present bar dates from the 1930s due to its style or even the 1960s? There are three stubs of partitions with coloured leaded panels in the top which could date from the 1930s or more likely be Greene King 1960s additions. Also, there may have been a small private bar on the ground floor possibly added in the 1930s and removed in the 1960s?  \n\nWhat is definitely a survival of Mooney\u2019s late Victorian interior is the dark panelling running all along the right hand wall featuring a number of small bevelled mirrors and a pair of magnificent glass panels advertising stout and whisky. They are signed \u2018H West, Houghton Street, Strand, WC\u2019. Given that it\u2019s the Irish spirit that is promoted you may be surprised by the spelling. We think of Scottish whisky but Irish whiskey but there was no such convention until well into the 20th century \u2013 hence we get Jameson\u2019s \u2018whisky\u2019 here.  \n \nThe upstairs bar is known as the Boar\u2019s Head Bar after the original name of the pub \u2013 it only acquired its present title after 1918 to commemorate the Great War song. There is the original staircase at the rear and at the front the staircase from the front lobby looks like it was a later addition, possibly in the 1930s? The upstairs bar has a 1930s brick fireplace painted a deep red colour, the fielded panelling looks like it could date from the same period, and the counter could have been added here in either the 1930s or 1960s. The bar back looks modern.",

        "Description": "In 1905 this pub \u2013 then a beerhouse - changed hands and, judging by the embellishment, was probably remodelled soon after that. It has a particularly attractive ground-floor frontage with a couple of curved bay windows and brown glazed brick facing. The etched windows with their leaded heads (best appreciated from inside) come with delightful representations of a wheatsheaf and Art Nouveau-style flowers. The \u2018jugs and bottles\u2019 department (named in the door glass) has gone but the pub still has two entirely separate rooms.  \r\n\r\nThe bar on the right was originally a small public bar and tap room behind (and off sales on the left) but the partition separating the two was removed in 1954 and the partition separating the off sales was removed later. The public bar sports a very fancy fireplace and mirrored overmantel: the tiled strips with stylised tulips are, again, typically Art Nouveau. The bar-back is plain and may be work of the 1930s (some lower shelves replaced by fridges) while the plain match-board counter is a replacement installed in 1986 and the mighty pot shelf is modern. Fixed seating doesn't look that old but the low baffles could well be. Small Victorian fireplace on the left in the former Bottles & Jugs area.  \r\n\r\nThe pub was extended to the left in 1934 by buying the properties next door to demolish them and build the new saloon bar - a single-storey room which has extensive three-quarter-height match-board panelling. Here the fire surround is much plainer than next door. The bar counter front looks to have been added to an older counter as the top looks old; the gnar back fitting looks more modern than old. The pub was probably called the Old Wheatsheaf to distinguish it from another Wheatsheaf in Baker Street situated at the other end of Enfield Town. \r\n\r\nHistoric information from A-Z of Enfield Pub's Part 1 by Gary Boudier (2000)",

At the same time, council have told owners to re-build it; they in turn have objected!! Planning app to demolish and replace with flats rejected in March 2019.  \n\nThis pub has therefore been re- categorised as Interior Ruined. The former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nThis pub was built in 1958 to serve the surrounding housing estate and therefore dates from a time when pub-building eventually got going again after the hardships of the post-war years. It has rather more architectural ambition than most of the functional pubs of its day, having been built in the kind of vernacular revival that had been popular in the period between the wars \u2013 with broad, sweeping roof-lines, dormer windows, tall chimneys and attractive brickwork. Inside there are two rooms, a public bar to the front and a lounge down the right-hand side. The latter has been expanded by a cut-through into what was originally part of the private accommodation. The public bar retains some characteristic panelling with broad flat members and narrower hollows picked out in black. Such panelling recurs in the lounge but, sadly, it has been painted over as has the bar counter (the bar counter in the public bar is a grim bit of Formica refacing). But for a quintessential piece of 1950s design look at the tiled surround to the fireplace in the lounge \u2013 it contains a series of tiles showing the eponymous jester and images of wine glasses just in case you had forgotten you are in a pub!",

        "Address": "55 Orsman Road, London, De Beauvoir Town, N1 5RA",
        "Description": "This drinkers\u2019 pub is one of many built between the wars by major East End brewers, Truman\u2019s, in this case, to serve a 1930s housing estate. The ground floor is faced with mottled blue and brown tiles that were then very popular for pub frontages, but in 2015 those above the dado were painted a deep red by a production company for a film about the Kray twins! Above the corner door is a tiled panel with the wording 'The Stags Head' and a stags head protruding from them. It is quite small and originally consisted of three bars, the public bar is on the right (on the street corner) was originally two small rooms and the narrow saloon on the left either side of a servery plus a \u2018home sales\u2019 compartment (now disused). In the 1950s or 1960s an extension was added on to the saloon though it seems they couldn\u2019t quite get the tile match right. \n\nThe interior is characteristic of Truman\u2019s house style. The bare wood floored public bar still retains the top section of wooden partitioning attached to the ceiling indicating it was originally two small rooms. The original bar counter of vertical panels with a checkerboard spittoon trough around the base remains. However, the small piece of bar counter at the rear is a later addition (no trough around it) and the rear snug may not have had a counter, possibly a hatch instead? The bar back fitting is the 1930s three sided one i.e. facing both bars and the off-sales with some modernisation - the mirrors look modern as does the wording at the top which includes 'Ben Truman'; there is a dumb waiter on the left hand side. The dado panelling around the whole room looks modern and there is a 1930s brick fireplace with a small relief panel of a leaping stag, all painted black. The intact gents' has inter-war floor to ceiling tiling but the ladies has been modernised. \n\nA doorway leads to the rare partitioned off-sales where the bar counter front is modern and the exterior door is no longer in use. \n\nAn original door leads to the wooden floored saloon bar which has a bar counter of a more elegant streamlined style with three horizontal strips and another checkerboard spittoon trough around the base, There are two 1930s brick fireplaces each with a small relief panel of a leaping stag - which is found in other Truman\u2019s pubs \u2013 and bevelled mirrors in the overmantels. Note the 'London Bridge Station' clock above the front fireplace. All the way around the room the walls are panelled to picture frame height with Truman's characteristic lettering advertising Oatmeal Stout, Eagle Ale, Imperial Stout, Truman's, and also 'London - Trumans - Burton'. \n\nOff to the left a couple of doorways leads to a music room with no old fittings but there are two unusual settles, parts of which came from wooden barrels. What is now the ladies was the gents until c.2010 and is intact since built with its ante-room holding the sink, a section with the former urinals (now boarded over) and the WC all with floor to ceiling inter-war tiling; what is now the gents' (was the ladies') has been modernised.",

The ground-floor frontage is a timber and glass screen and behind it is an extraordinarily high bar area. Historic survivals include the bar counter, the stillion in the middle of the serving area, vestiges of an inner porch on the left, two cast-iron columns and a full-height timber and glass screen forming a (now doorless) room to the rear right.

The three-storey exterior was quite plain apart from some pretty herringbone brickwork however new owners have removed the white paint to reveal a ground floor of glazed stone in shades of turquoise. A series of doors indicates there were originally several internal spaces, probably including an off-sales area. \r\n\r\nA refurbishment to the main bar on the left has, sadly, removed the original bar back fitting (& dumb waiter) and 1930s bar counter (the replacement counter has a imitation 1930s panelled front). The walls at the front of the room are still lined to two-thirds height with veneer which is then embellished with applied strips and painted bands to create panelled decoration that looks almost like marquetry. The former smoke room on the corner has been reduced in size by insertion of a stud wall and has lost its 1930s bar counter. What does remain is more of the unusual vaneer panelling on three walls and an Art Deco tiled fireplace (disused) with wood surround and there is now a gap to access it from the main bar. Also remaining is the complicated metal openers to the upper lights of the windows in both areas.",

        "Pub Name": "Scottish Stores",
        "Address": "2-4 Caledonian Road, London, King's Cross, N1 9DU",
        "Description": "The Scottish Stores retains an incredibly intact partitioned interior of 1901 consisting of three separate bars and as such is one of the rarest of the few surviving partitioned interiors in London. \n\r\nRebuilt 1900-1 by architects Wylson and Long, probably for James Kirk. It is a five-storey building of brown glazed brick and buff terracotta with polished pink and grey granite on the ground floor, and en suite with the corner block.\n\r\nThe interior is of a central servery surrounded by three distinct compartments created by two floor to ceiling screens. One screen runs back from the street front to the rear wall and has some etched glass panels and lots of plain bevelled ones creating the right hand bar.\n\r\nAnother impressive screen is parallel to the street incorporating the bar back with shallow double-curved arches. This creates the front and rear rooms. The cornice mouldings indicates all the original partitions survive and only doorway width gaps in them have made to enable customers to walk all around the pub. Above the gap between the right-hand and rear bars there is an architrave (?) held up by carved brackets which indicates there was always a door here. Also, the gap between the front and rear bars looks like it was originally a door.\n\r\nThe gap between the front and right rooms look it has been created by carefully removing one panel in the partition. To the left of the gap from front bar to rear bar there is what looks like a doorway but it has been filled by the section of the partition that was removed to form a doorway gap as it is identical to the part of the partition between the gap and the bar counter. Presumably the door originally led to the toilets, which are now accessed by a wide gap from the rear bar.\n\r\nThe right hand door is no longer in use (entrance to the pub being via the far left-hand door) and has a shallow vestibule with a figure \u20181\u2019 on the inside of the inner door.\n\r\nThe right hand bar has fielded panelling to two-thirds height with a set of coloured lithographs of hunting scenes by Cecil Aldin of 1900, set into frames in the panelling. High up over the bar-back the partition has a cartouche inscribed 'THE SCOTTISH STORES 1901' and below it detail in relief in the spandrels. What looks like the original bar counter is curved at both ends and there is cupboard in the front. New tiling in front of the counter.\n\r\nThe front bar has fielded panelling to two-thirds height and also on the left-hand wall are some of the coloured lithographs of hunting scenes by Cecil Aldin. The woodwork in the servery of the partition has a curious mixture of Gothic and Jacobean detailing and there is more detail in relief in the spandrels. Some lower shelving remains on the left but most has been lost to a couple of fridges. The front bar counter looks to be the original to which more modern panels have been added. Near the gap in the bar counter there is some suspended wood down from the ceiling which may indicate there was a dumb waiter here originally? New tiling in front of the counter. Note the figure \u20182\u2019 to the side of the middle double (disused) doors.\n\r\nThe rear bar has fielded panelling\u00a0on the back wall, including another coloured lithograph of a hunting scene.\u00a0The bar counter here looks to be the original and above it is a wide hatch that is also part of the partition across the centre of the pub. Above the \u2018hatch\u2019 the screen has 5 glazed panes and just below the ceiling a clock on a bracket. New tiling in front of the counter. On the rear left there is a staircase with a newel post having Jacobean detailing and an octagonal finial of Arts and Crafts character. The screenwork around the staircase has multiple etched glass panels. A doorway in the screen leads back to the front bar. Some external etched glass panels remain.\n\r\nIn 2015 it changed from a pub called the Flying Scotsman known to have strippers performing throughout the day to the welcoming to all bright and clean pub now selling a wide range of real ales. Fortunately (miraculously?) the interior fittings survived pretty much unmolested, helped by the buildings Grade II listing and a detailed interior description. The restoration won the pub the CAMRA Historic England Conservation Award in the 2016 Pub Design Awards.\n\r\nIn front of the left and right entrances the remnants of \u2018The Scottish Stores\u2019 mosaics were in 2015 covered over by modern tiling (they say with the agreement of Historic England) and the pub reverted to its original name.\n\r\nIn 2016 the pub was extended into the adjacent property on the left hand side facing the pub. The connection is through narrow doorway from the front bar and has had no effect on the ambiance of the original building. Warning: often may have very loud music.",

Outside there are ironwork pub lanterns, a bow-fronted window, and attractive window glass with dimpled panes and pretty, coloured strips. Like the Rose & Crown, the interior displays typical trademarks of Truman\u2019s inter-war fitting and furnishings. There is characteristic advertising lettering (see over the bar-back), brick fire surrounds with small relief panels (in this case a hunter and dog, knight on horseback, and a couple of galleons) and a very distinctive cream-coloured ceiling made up of Vitrolite panels (just as at the Rose & Crown). Originally the pub would have been divided up into a sequence of separate rooms by screens but these have now all gone. However, you can still see two different treatments in the bar counter detailing which signify separate drinking areas (the usual distinction being plain for the public bar, smarter for the rest). The bar-back is also original.",

You can also trace the sequence of original rooms in the metal signs over the doors: right to left \u2013 public bar, private bar, outdoor sales, saloon and lounge. Internally there is still a good feel of the 1930s layout since the screens dividing the various rooms survive in their upper parts. Do have a look at the light-shades. Extraordinary as it may seem, these appear original and different parts of the pub have different-shaped shades.\n\r\nThe panelling in the interior is in classic Truman\u2019s style of the 1930s. Characteristics involve advertising lettering on the panelling naming some of the brewery\u2019s offerings, the chequered spittoon trough, light-cream-coloured Vitrolite panels in the ceiling, overmantels with Truman\u2019s mirrors inserts, and doors in the bar counter to get at the beer engines. Note also some of the chairs, which are not unlike the 1930s survivors at the Fox and Pheasant, West Brompton.

Interestingly, this pub didn\u2019t start life as a pub but as the Palace Caf\u00e9, opened in 1875, the same year as Alexandra Palace. It turned into a pub by 1896 and was refitted by Richard Dickenson of St John Street, Adelphi, in 1899 \u2013 no doubt the date of much of what we see today. Inside is a central servery from which compartments once radiated and the six outside doors show these were numerous and therefore small. The surviving screen panels are formed of timber and etched glass, the latter embellished with the small birds and swirling foliage that never failed to delight late-Victorian pub owners and customers. The panelled oak bar counter is Victorian as are the mirrors in the central stillion (although the structure itself is modern). The timber arch above, however, is Victorian, and spans two mighty, fluted cast-iron Corinthian columns. Another item of interest is the mosaic flooring marking out a former corridor leading from the St Michael\u2019s Terrace entrance. You will also find a well preserved bank of snob screens sitting on the counter.\n\nOther Heritage Pubs with snob screens are Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham; Prince Alfred, London W9;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Bunch of Grapes, London SW3;  Crown, London N1; and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but these have been moved.",

        "Description": "A down-to-earth pub, which, although opened out, still retains a remarkable amount of Victorian work. Its changes over the years have been carefully documented and a history at the pub enables us to follow its evolution. The Beaconsfield was built in 1886-7 to the designs of the obscure architects Alexander and Gibbon who drew upon 17th-century details for inspiration. After the arrival of the third licensee in 1897 the internal arrangements were changed with the installation of the present island servery which was surrounded by a series of compartments.\n\r\nThe plan was drawn up by John E Pinder. One partition was removed in 1904 by F J Eedle & Meyers, minor alterations were made in 1934 and further partitions were removed in 1953. The single space we have today was the work of Courage (Eastern) Breweries\u2019 chief architect, Mr Longstaff, in 1981 when the last remaining divisions were removed. The Victorian work remaining consists of the spacious servery (with its stillion in the middle), the richly decorated ceiling, six cast-iron columns, curved lobby entrance on the corner, a considerable amount of etched mirrorwork towards the rear and some stained glass.",

This and its estate were sold as the relentless tide of bricks and mortar engulfed the area following on from the arrival of the railway in 1867. Inside, the great feature is a massive, glazed-in office surrounded on three sides by the servery. It is formed by floor to ceiling glazed partition with curved glass on the front corners and its windows have remarkably lovely, delicate etched glass with trails of foliage and depictions of flowers and birds. Decorative etched original glass remains on the doors on the left (which has 'Private' on it) and right. Note the lower bar back shelves around the office held up by slender pillars. There are more pillars all the way up to the top section of the office.\n\r\nThe large bar counter is original but now painted brown and has a number of doors for servicing beer engines in former times. About 40 years ago the counter was shortened to create more room for the customers. Look for the platform on the left hand side and that some of the lower shelving attached to the office screenwork on the left hand side is now exposed. One piece of counter front on the right hand side of the partition at the front is different to the rest of the counter - it looks more like 1930s fielded panelling? There is a good dado panelling also painted brown and on the rear right is an original wood surround fireplace where the glazed brick interior has been painted black.\n\r\nImpressive vestibules around the corner and right hand side doors have two doors each so originally there were four partitioned rooms around the island bar counter. Most of these have been swept away but one screen survives (just at high level) with yet more lovely glazing. The high ceiling is held up by marble pillars. At the rear right, through an arch from the main bar, there is a room with a bare wood floor, an original dado panelling, an original wood surround fireplace covered by a piano and a diagonally boarded ceiling. Former function room upstairs has been converted into B & B rooms. Don\u2019t miss the wonderful ironwork over the two entrance porches with the wording 'Winchester Hall Hotel'.",

        "Description": "When originally built in 1897 this pub must have been a stunner. The architects were Shoebridge & Rising who were responsible for many a London pub. Here they produced a flamboyant essay in the Flemish Renaissance manner. The raised brick lettering, ornamental ironwork (from Jones and Willis, Art Metal Works in Hornsey) and the etched and cut glass give an expectation of splendours within. The interior of the pub was remodelled in the late 20th century by the late Roderick Gradidge, one of the most sensitive architects of the time dealing with pub refurbishments. The front parts are now a single space but some sense of subdivision has been achieved by the reuse of the original fine glazed screenwork.\r\n\r\nThe L-shaped servery still has its 1897 counter and the bar-back is lined with a series of lovely decorated mirrors. There is a skylight over the rear left-hand area. Another, bigger skylight sits near the wonderfully gracious music room at the rear. It is spanned by two hefty tie-beams and has rich plaster friezes on the main walls and also below the skylight. The swirly decoration (similar to that in the main bar) on the coving looks as though it may be Gradidge\u2019s work as is perhaps the fireplace.",

It is a prominent corner-site pub built in about 1865 for a developer, Daniel Tidey. The dominant feature outside is the bold first-floor windows with their alternating segmented and triangular heads. The interior, although much pulled around in modern times, still retains a great deal of interesting Victorian work, probably from a refitting in around 1890. \r\n\r\nThe building was a pub-cum-hotel and the lobby off Belsize Park Gardens has a floor mosaic proclaiming \u2018Washington Hotel\u2019 with the added temptation of \u2018Billiards\u2019 (ornamental door glass advertises \u2018hotel lounge\u2019 and \u2018hotel bar\u2019). The first American president\u2019s bust appears in tiling above in a curious juxtaposition with some languid classical ladies. The name \u2018W Holman\u2019 here no doubt identifies the proprietor who redeveloped the place. There are lots of remnants of screenwork including three bays of a full-height timber and glass partition.\r\n\r\nAt the back are a series of the kind of back-painted mirrors depicting flora and fauna (two large mirrors on left feature herons, followed by a square mirror depicting general flora, then five to the right featuring songbirds and flora of different types) which seem to have been popular with late-Victorian pub owners. But the most extraordinary thing at the Washington is the high screen set above and forward from one side of the servery which is placed in the middle of the pub, in the centre of which is what would undoubtedly have been a waiter's position and is now an opening for staff. It has glazing in its top parts and parts of the arcading survive.",

It is up an alleyway right in the heart of Hampstead village and was rebuilt in 1873-4 by architects, Cumming & Nixon. The historic parts are at the front and what makes them special is the timber and glass screen dividing the two bars. On the saloon side it carries five chromolithographs of delightfully sentimental paintings by the Belgian artist, Jan Van Beers (1852-1927), whose name and partially obscured date \u2018188?\u2019 appear on the one nearest the street. Van Beers specialised in this kind of work and it quite clearly appealed mightily to the landlord of the day. Above are etched glass panels with swirling patterns and birds. The public bar (left) is now larger than it once was, having incorporated the former private bar (so-named in the side door glass). It\u2019s a pity that the front windows have been replaced with plain panes. The counter and bar-back are original and other features to note are the strips of tilework in both front bars, the extraordinary cast-iron column in the public bar, the metal fire surrounds (particularly ornate in the saloon), the decorated cornice and clocks on either side of the screen.

There has been a good deal of alteration over the years with major extensions at the back and repositioning of old features such as etched glass but the character of the front parts is a delight. The simply panelled bar counter and the coved bar-back are survivors from Victorian days. The two outside front doors are clear evidence of separate drinking areas inside and until 2014 there was a run of low screenwork and a baffle attached to the counter which had already seen removal of the doors. Now there is only a tiny snug on the right-hand part which has full-height matchboard panelling. However, the low screen, with its tiny doorway for cleaners, has been retained and can be found in the rear dining room. The short glazed screen originally on top of the bar counter towards the centre of the room has been moved to the right hand end.  \r\n\r\nOn the left is a room described in the window glass as a coffee room which is entered by two doorways (one modern) leading off the main bar. This was no doubt for more refined customers who did not want to consume alcohol. This room has baffles to the seats which have recently been re-upholstered and an ornate iron fire surround inserted",

        "Address": "292 Kentish Town Road, London, Kentish Town, NW5 2TG",
        "Description": "When it opened in 1898 this pub epitomised the grand, luxurious kind of establishment that was the hallmark of the great pub boom. The architects were Thorpe & Furniss. They provided an ambitious design outside in the Flemish Renaissance style which boasts a tourelle on the corner. There is ornate ironwork, polished stone facing on the ground floor and a series of prominent dormer windows. The interior has undergone a pretty comprehensive modernisation yet there is still a lot of historic work to enjoy. You can still appreciate that the multiple entrances would have given access to a compartmentalised interior of the kind the Victorians liked. Even today, the front part (completely gutted) feels physically separated from the back. \r\n\r\nThe best feature is the survival in the rear parts of one of the most elaborate panel-and-mirror displays anywhere. Set in tall rectangular panels are etched and cut mirrors with birds, foliage, swags and other decorative devices (note that a couple of large panels are later replacements \u2013 they lack the brilliant cutting of the Victorian originals). The surviving bar-back, a tall, delicate piece, has similar work and is further embellished with touches of gilding. Other things to note are the lavish ceiling, cast-iron columns and the back room which has a large skylight to what was originally a billiard room.",

        "Description": "The Bull & Gate was built in 1871 (see the helpful date-stone outside). It is a showy bit of architecture. Note external details such as the projecting single-storey part at the front, the shell shaped heads to the first-floor windows, the ornate fascia with the pub name and, of course, the plaster depiction over the entrance of a bull and gate. \r\n\r\nIt retains a Victorian curved panelled counter with pilasters and cornelled brackets but it has a modern metal top added by Youngs in 2015. The far left section of the bar counter front is missing an ornate pilaster so there have been changes here in recent times. The Victorian bar back fitting has a stunning array of decorated cut-glass mirrors with swirling sprays of foliage. There are ornate vestibule entrances from both the left and right doors with ornate plasterwork picked out in various colours at the top. The Lincrusta ceiling is an ornate piece of work too,  recently painted white. Note also the fluted cast-iron columns which support the upper floors. \r\n\r\nThere is a round arch between the two parts of the front bar \u2013 it has fluted jambs and, in the head, Neo-Classical urns and lion heads. There is another decorative carved shallow arch between front left and rear left areas \u2013 the rear section was originally the billiard room and has a modest octagonal skylight: the glazing, sadly, has been replaced with plain panels but the foliage swags around the drum are original, equally sadly the colourful frieze was painted over in one pastel colour in 2015. Another carved arch at the rear leads to the ladies and disabled toilets There are two reproduction Victorian\u2013style fireplaces. A doorway has been cut to far left room area. At the rear the former music venue has been converted into a dining room and has no old features. Boulonge bar upstairs has no old fittings.",

        "Description": "A tucked-away small corner local that was, fortunately, saved in the face of a closure threat in 2001 by a vigorous and effective local effort. Three-storey of yellow stock brick built around 1868. Above the ground floor windows and doors there are pineapple motifs in stone relief suitably painted. Twin front doors have \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 on them in gilt \u2013 possibly 1920s wording? In the windows either side, one pane has \u2018Ind Coope\u2019 and the other \u2018Double Diamond\u2019, also in gilt lettering on frosted glass. Metal gates on main exterior doors.  \r\n\r\nThe interior consists of a U-shaped front bar with some small areas at the rear. Originally two separate rooms as there is a door on the left hand side of the pub with mosaic floor just inside the pub indicating a small vestibule. The Pineapple has a truly spectacular feature \u2013 the bar-back, a three-bay piece, and one of the best such examples from the mid-Victorian period anywhere. It is made of mahogany and has, at the top, panels with mirrored lettering advertising \u201cWHISKIES\u201d, \u201cBRANDIES\u201d and \u201cWINES\u201d. There are three etched glass mirrors depicting vases of flowers. The top of the central mirror is almost covered by an old clock. Dividing the panels are four pilasters with florid Corinthian capitals. In between are narrow etched mirrors with urns bursting with foliage. The lower shelving has been lost to fridges but there are consoles with carved pineapples.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter seems original with brackets and panels added to the front so it looks more modern; the top is definitely modern. Ceiling to main bar retains decorative plaster cornice. On the right is a wood surround and Victorian (reproduction) cast iron and tiled fireplace with above it an enormous \u2018Bass & Co\u2019s Pale Ale\u2019 mirror that almost reaches the ceiling. The dado paneling looks old and painted a cream colour.  \r\n\r\nOn the left level with the bar back is a wood lined arch which looks old but on the right the wide gap could be more recent but the dado panelling goes across the gap so it could have been like this for many years. Through the arch on the left is a small area and on the left is an original marble surround fireplace with a modern grate. Above is a large \u2018Bass Pale & Burton Ales\u2019 mirror (cracked). More of the dado paneling that looks old but painted a cream colour and there is a part glazed baffle (modern?). A widish gap leads to another small area with assorted seating and a modest skylight with a pineapple in frosted glass in the middle of three panes.  \r\n\r\nYou can cross to the right hand side rear are through a door marked \u2018Private\u2019 in gold lettering (kept open) and a staircase upstairs and part paneled passage to toilets. Through another door to the right rear area. Modern fixed seating all around the right rear area with the same dado paneling. At the rear is a conservatory room popular with diners. Upstairs there is a room at the front with bar wood floor and old wood surround fireplace. Wide gap to smaller room at rear left with another wood surround and cast iron fireplace and old leather covered benches.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2015. \u2028Largely demolished on 8 April - prompted by Historic England recently advising the owners of its impending statutory listing. Unfortunately for the Tel Aviv- based owners, this was two days after it became law that planning permission would be required to demolish an Asset of Community Value (ACV). 600 pubs have now been registered as ACVs, and the number is rising. So, Westminster Council stepped in, halted work, and then on 5 May voted to order the rebuilding of the pub, brick by brick within 18 months. CAMRA members have been active is seeking ACV status for community pubs and the cautionary tale of the Carton Tavern illustrates how important this is.  \nThis pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028 The accompanying photographs show the interior before the demolition took place.  \u2028\n\nThis attractive inter-war pub is still very much a community local in what is now a sea of drab post-war housing. The ceramic advertising fascias leave no doubt as to who built it \u2013 the major East End brewers, Charrington\u2019s. Look out for the unusual sign down the side \u2013 \u2018Carlton Luncheon and Tea Room\u2019. The original layout is still very apparent with a large public bar on the right, a smaller, better-class saloon on the left with the single-storey \u2018luncheon and tea room\u2019 still intact behind. Each room retains its original counter and back fittings although, sadly, those in the public bar seem to have been subjected to a varnish stripper with dire results. As usual with inter-war pub fittings the details are restrained. A really attractive feature of the pub is the ceiling in the left-hand bar with its plaster foliage friezes and other decoration, now picked out in red and gold. There is similar decoration on a more modest scale in the luncheon room. Sadly most of the original window glass has been replaced.",

The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nThis part of the St John\u2019s Wood area was redeveloped in the 1920s and, along with the new blocks of flats, came a community facility, the rebuilt Richmond Arms.

The smaller of these, on the right, has its original fireplace and pretty decorative frames on the walls: its detailing is mirrored in the bar counter and bar-back. Very similar treatment reappears in the front left-hand room which retains its fireplace and the vestiges of a screen to a third, rear room.\n\nAll three rooms have their original counters and back fittings; the rear room still retains its dumb waiter. The three original rooms are now all interconnected but the original arrangements and the old layout is easily understood. On the counter there are now gantry structures, which are in themselves period pieces. The lettering on the fronts is quintessentially 1960s or 1970s work and therefore from the time when such gantries started to become commonplace features on pub bar counters everywhere.",

        "Description": "In what must be the shortest street in London, the delightful Lord Clyde pub was rebuilt in 1913 and has a marvellous exterior with lots of ceramic work. Pride of place goes to a majestic eagle, the emblem of East End brewers, Truman, Hanbury and Buxton, while the fascia over the corner entrance bears the name \u2018E J Bayling\u2019 who must have been the owner and/or licensee on the eve of the Great War. Even the window surrounds are highly decorative. Inside, there are two rooms but originally a partition separated the public bar into two. The public bar (front) has a tapering, match-boarded counter and partly panelled walls. Note the fine mirror advertising \u2018Mild Ales and Double Stout\u2019. The back bar has a hatch to the servery and more wall panelling. A framed Truman\u2019s price list tells us the prices of beer back in 1961. The fittings and detailing have a restraint and simplicity which forms a marked contrast to the ornateness of pubs from a decade or so before and gives a hint of what would come after the First World War. The changes are minimal with some modern work on the fireplaces, fridges replacing half of the lower bar back shelving and modernised toilets.",

It has received an unsympathetic refurbishment by Youngs removing most of the old fittings, leading to it being re-categorised as Interior Ruined. \n\nThe former description is shown below.\n\n\nIn 1890 when this pub was rebuilt it was no doubt a fairly basic establishment, serving people using and working at  Borough Market. Nowadays the market is massively gentrified (with prices to match!) but the Wheatsheaf still looks much as it has done for a couple of generations. The pub stretches back from the street and is split down the middle by a screen which is straddled by the servery. The door glass helpfully informs us that the left-hand part was the public bar and the right-hand was the saloon. The sense of separation is still much in evidence though the screen has been broken through at the rear \u2013 most people frequenting this area today are pretty well-off and therefore not too bothered about social separation in their pubs. The glass in the front windows suggests inter-war work and much of what we see inside may well date from that time. The walls have full-height matchboard panelling and the detailing of the counters and screen is quite plain. A very nice modern touch is the series of prints by Mychael Barratt, mostly \u2018Life Imitating Art\u2019 scenes of daily life in London incorporating references to famous paintings.",

It must have been truly enormous when originally built in the 1930s by Truman\u2019s brewery. They have provided an unusual piece of architecture here \u2013 quite blocky with the central three bays rising to an extra floor above the side ones. The pub is still large with two epic rooms at the back. These have interestingly contrasted characters: that on the right has a Tudor look with an inglenook fireplace, panelled walls, Wood Look beams and cartouches on the walls with such would-be antique emblems as a visored knight, a portcullis, a swan and red roses. \r\n\r\nThe other room has decidedly simple Art Deco details. The front room \u2013 small in comparison \u2013 was originally no doubt intended to be a smart one as is suggested by the elegant canopy over the bar counter. The counters throughout are original but the back fittings are largely modern. Other features to look out for are the brown and white spittoon trough tiling (a feature of many 1930s Truman\u2019s pubs) and original tiling in the gents\u2019.",

It seems to date from the 1930s and was designed in a (loosely) Neo-Georgian style. It has the fa\u00efence facing on the ground floor that was so popular at the time. Paradoxically the interest of the interior lies in its modesty. This guide has many ornate and well crafted interiors. These have had greater chances of survival than simpler schemes which were run up on the cheap and that\u2019s exactly what we have here. The wall panelling is utilitarian ply and the bar counter is very similar although there is a band near the top imitating a more luxurious veneer. \n\nMuch of the original layout can still be discerned with an L-shaped serving area with two rooms forming an L-shape on the roadsides and a square room behind (now used for games). The former has a counter for service, the latter a hatch. Other original features are the pretty coloured glazing in the windows, doors in the bar counter and no doubt some of the loose chairs. A more modern (perhaps 1970s) curiosity is the raked bar stools which look as though they ought to defy gravity. A modern travesty (it has to be said) is the louvered screenwork at the bottom of the windows, cheaply made and producing a gloomy sense of secrecy which was never the intention of 1930s pub builders.\n\nUpdate 2014 \n\nThe pub underwent refurbishment in 2014 which resulted in the removal of some of the panelling which has adversely affected the interior. The front wall of the L-shaped bar, the dado on the side wall, and the dado in the small rear room are now of bare brick. Also the bar counter fronts have been painted a gastro grey colour as has all the lower bar back shelving, and the fireplace, which is blocked-up.",

The Albion has two-thirds-height panelling throughout of the type that was so popular between the wars. The raked counter is original and so is the woodwork in the central serving area. There are typical inter-war brick fireplaces. There are also a few jarring notes throughout such as the ironwork pot-shelves and a refrigerated food counter but all in all this is a good survival among inter-war pubs. Also you may care to drop in at the Mayflower which fronts onto the Thames \u2013 it has some old panelling but most of the woodwork is of no great age.

It is probably Victorian but seems to have been substantially remodelled and refitted in the inter-war years but with one interesting nineteenth century survival, a bar back. Three exterior doors indicate there were at least three (possibly four) original bars. In changes in 2018 a rare screen \u2013 barely over head height \u2013 that split the two bars fronting Jago Close was sadly removed. \n\nThe left-hand side is a single-storey \u2018saloon lounge\u2019 (wording in gold on a frosted panel in the left of the two inner doors) and has a vestibule entrance with a terrazzo floor and leaded panels, a parquet floor, three-quarter-height fielded panelling all around the room, a plain skylight and a couple of inter-war brick fire surrounds \u2013 all from the inter-war period. The bar counter is an inter-war panelled one with a checkerboard apron around the base and Art Deco-style bar back has some attractive striped glazing but modern mirrors. The bar back was painted a dark blue colour in 2018. Both the gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets are unchanged with a dado of inter-war tiling, terrazzo floors and part glazed screens. \n\nOn the right there is now a L-shaped room following the removal of the screen. The former front right \u2018public bar\u2019 (wording in gold on a frosted panel in the two inner doors) has a vestibule entrance with a terrazzo floor and leaded panels at the top. The bar counter is old and was painted a grey-blue colour in recent times but the paint was removed in 2018. The bar back is the same style as the left-hand inter-war one and painted a dark blue colour in 2018. A fireplace was lost in 2018. \n\nThe former room on the right hand side has a vestibule entrance from Jago Close with a terrazzo floor, leaded panels and two doors indicating there was another division sometime in the past. This is confirmed by the bar counter in two different styles \u2013 the left-hand part is from the inter-war period but the right hand panelled one dates back to Victorian times. It originally reached the rear wall until it was cut back in recent years. There is another similar mirrored inter-war bar back on the left that was painted a dark blue colour in 2018. At the rear is what appears to be a Victorian bar-back, complete with four pretty, flowery narrow mirror strips (note the unusual shallow high-level cupboard in it), and four carved brackets. There was a door where the glazed panel had a star burst and the word \u2018Inn\u201d but this was removed in 2017. The plaster has been taken off the wall at the rear of this room. \n\nNote the gas-light fittings \u2013 four on the right-hand side and two (with shades) in the saloon lounge. When Arsenal FC (originally Woolwich Arsenal) were playing on Plumstead Common the team used the upstairs room at the Star as changing rooms. There are two rooms upstairs with no old fittings.",

        "Description": "A large and much-frequented establishment built as a pub-cum-hotel around 1900 to designs by busy pub architects Eedle & Meyers. The symmetrical exterior is worthy of a good look for such details as the decorative plasterwork, cast-iron lamp standards and light brackets. The character has changed greatly inside but on the left hand side a couple of screens remain from the days when there would have been a multiplicity of rooms. In this area there were bars described as being for \u2018the lower class of customer\u2019 (no such problem today in well-heeled Dulwich). What is now the main bar area was originally known as the saloon and to the right of this, and originally separate from it, was the panelled coffee room. The restaurant used to be a billiard room and at the back left was a skittle alley. There are some good details of around 1900 remaining in terms of etched glass with the names of some of the former rooms, a good bar-back with plenty of decoration and, over the partition between main bar and former coffee room, some re-sited snob-screens. But don\u2019t miss the lavish tall friezes and the impressive ceiling decoration. Also pretty mosaic flooring on the left-hand side from a former corridor. The counters, by contrast, are quite plain.\n\nOther Heritage Pubs with snob screens are Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham; Prince Alfred, London W9;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Starting Gate, London N22;  Crown, London N1; and  Bunch of Grapes, London SW3.",

        "Description": "A beautifully preserved example of inter-war pub-fitting. The original building is Victorian but it was given a thorough remodelling in the 1930s and this work is cherished by the current owners who offer a good balance between drinking and dining. The window glass tells us that the front left-hand room was the public bar, while the right-hand one was the saloon lounge. The glass is a lovely survivor with clear, textured panes enlivened by others with mottled green glass. There is a third room behind the public bar: both these left-hand rooms have wall panelling and attractive, original tiled fireplaces. In recent times an opening has been made between the public and saloon/lounge so that the rooms are connected internally.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe saloon lounge, extended out from the Victorian pub, has an interesting rounded termination and a very individual red-brick fireplace which is a complete contrast to the others. The bar counters and back fittings are original but quite conventional: the latter, on the saloon lounge side, appears to have had a dumb waiter (currently occupied by wine bottles). There are attractive black and white 'mosaic' tiles around the front of the bar counter in both bars. Don\u2019t miss the quite delightful 1930s chairs in the saloon lounge with their sides made of solid boards and their upward-sweeping arm rests.",

        "Description": "A most appealing Victorian corner local, which was given a makeover probably in the 1920s. The exterior tilework of that time has, sadly, been painted over, but doesn\u2019t spoil the enjoyment of the interior. There are still three separate rooms with a public bar on the corner, a saloon to the left and a large room running across the back of the pub. There was once a small snug at the back of the public bar entered by the now sealed double doors but the partition wall was moved in the 1960s. The servery has an unusual T-shaped layout designed to create a counter in each of the rooms. The fittings are typical of their time \u2013 plain and undemonstrative in contrast to earlier Victorian exuberance.\n\r\nThe counters have plain panelling and the bar-back is also modest but with Tudor arches under the lowest tier of shelves. Unfortunately, an extension to the saloon counter has been made in recent times which is not in sympathy with the original: indeed, it is not even the same height, or of the same material and detracts somewhat from the overall effect. All the ceilings have exposed beams \u2013 not the real thing though: they\u2019re just nailed on to create an \u2018olde worlde\u2019 effect. Another sign that the refit was done on a low budget is the use of imitation wood panelling in all the rooms. The fireplaces are pleasing \u2013 the one in the rear room with a decorated metal hood and the one in the saloon with a grey-blue tiled surround and a tile with an improbable-looking sailing ship. Attractive benches in the saloon and rear room. An unusual feature is the way customers are free to walk across the serving area between the saloon and rear room.",

It still retains a lot of its inter-war fittings but, sadly, in 2013, owners Taylor Walker removed the division between public bar and the rear lounge and applied \u2018gastro grey\u2019 coloured paint to all of the panelling on the walls. \r\n\r\nAt the front of the pub the smallish public bar area has typical inter-war fielded wall panelling painted \u2018gastro grey, the original bar counter of fielded panelling, thankfully still with its original dark stain but the bar back fitting is modern work. There is parquet floor in front of the servery but there is an inappropriate reproduction Victorian, tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace and the ceiling has also been painted a gastro grey colour\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe impressive part is the back room, which is probably the result of an amalgamation of two. The rear part is a good example of one of a \u2018brewers\u2019 Tudor\u2019 attempt at creating a medieval-style hall. This one has panelled walls and hefty, rustically treated timbers to the roof trusses \u2013 no doubt concealing very \u2018un-Tudor\u2019 steel beams but sadly, all have been painted gastro grey\u2019. Note how much use is made of imitation adzed tooling on the timbers to enhance ye olde effect. There are also dormer windows and an attractive brick fire surround which has recently been painted a shade of yellow with modern work above it. The small bar counter has an original front of fielded panelling still mercifully sporting its original dark stain but the back fitting is modern work. There is much \u2018bookshelf\u2019 wallpaper on the walls.",

There has been a great deal of opening out and replacement of fittings internally such as the modern bar counter in the rear section and the modern pewter-style bar top throughout but this pub is included here for the startling and impressive amount of high quality glass. \r\n\r\nMost notable is the row of etched and coloured mirrors lining the blind wall of the front bar but close examination shows that some have cut scalloped edges, but others have the same design, but are not etched so may be modern copies. Equally impressive is the eight-bay bar-back in the rear saloon with pilasters and capitals picked out in gold and in particular the etched mirror glass. \r\n\r\nThere are doors with etched and coloured glass bearing the name \u2018saloon\u2019. In complete contrast is the inter-war glass in the front bar outside windows where pretty, coloured pieces are interspersed randomly in the rippled and plain panes. The bar counter in the front bar is probably late-Victorian and dado fielded panelling looks old. You should also note the grid design of the ceilings throughout.",

        "Description": "Built in 1864 and altered in 1894 (architect unknown), the latter date accounting, no doubt, for a pretty spectacular assemblage of glass and woodwork. A three-storey building of stucco with moulded key stones. Single storey extension to left. There are etched windows at ground floor level, one reading 'BRANDIES', the other reading 'WINES AND SPIRITS'. Listed description states the projecting porch has mosaic floor reading' THE DUKES HEAD'; the floor of the porch now has modern brown tiling thus the mosaic may have been lost.\n\r\nThe impressive entrance on Thames Place has a recessed two-bay arcade entrance with a coloured mosaic floor, a dado of blue and brown glazed wall tiles and a short staircase to the saloon bar. The door has the wording \u2018saloon lounge\u2019 in etched glass panel and oddly, also has the word \u2018billiards\u2019 incised into the woodwork at the bottom.\n\r\nEntering the pub via the impressive entrance there is a full height screen on the inside where the wood has been painted a green-grey colour. There is also another entrance with a vestibule having more of the decorative etched glass panels and the woodwork painted a green-grey colour. The front parts of the Duke\u2019s Head have a large central servery with an island bar-back.\n\r\nThere are still three distinct spaces created by full height glazed screens of panelled and carved timber. The public bar is at the front (on the disused corner doors are the wording \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018bar\u2019); the saloon bar in the middle; and overlooking the River Thames the lounge. Originally there were two further screens in the public bar now removed, but joinery on bar counter shows where these would have been attached. Also, a blocked-up corner door, a large entrance on the left on the Lower Richmond Road, and a door to the single storey extension confirms there were three rooms originally.\n\r\nThe most impressive surviving full-height screen slices through the back part of the servery and has a reduced height service door between the public and saloon bars. On the other side there is a wide arch from the servery to the screen around the impressive entrance. The screens are filled with etched and cut glass with flowers and swirling decoration which are to be found in other glasswork here. The full height screen between the lounge and the public bar was subject to the cutting of an unnecessarily wide opening in 2006.\n\r\nThe third splendid full-height glazed screen at the rear separates the front parts of the pub from a large room with impressive views over the Thames, formerly the lounge. Now called the Coxswain Restaurant, it has a widish archway on the right hand side and two large fireplaces with marble surrounds. The room has lost a small quarter circle bar counter to be replaced by a larger modern servery unit.\n\r\nThe bar counter has broad panels, each with the characteristic London feature of opening (in this case drop-down) lockable doors which allowed servicing of the beer engines. In the lounge there is a small mirrored dumb-waiter rising from bar counter. The central stillion has a modern base with Victorian upper parts with pretty coving ornamented by floral swags. In the middle is the glazed-in head to the cellar steps.\n\r\nEtched and cut glazing carried through in internal and external doors and passageways. The lounge and some areas in public and saloon bars retain their cornice and decorated frieze. In the public bar there is a short part glazed screen by the left hand door. There is a small fireplace with wooden surround in the saloon bar.\n\r\nAt the rear of the saloon bar there is a staircase and around it more glazed screenwork with high up two etched \u2018Club Room\u2019 panels indicating the previous use of first floor rooms. One has riverside views and is called the Wolsey Room with a large marble fireplace, the other is called the Meeting Room.\n\r\nIn the basement with an entrance facing the River Thames with tidal flood gates there was for many years a disused skittles alley, and used by the Putney Rowing Club to store its boats between 1929 and 1986 \u2013 there is a plaque on the exterior. The pub sits at the start of the Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race. The former skittles alley is now called The Rowing Club and used for live music events etc. with very modern fittings.",

It sits on a sharp hill among the tower blocks of the London County Council\u2019s Alton East estate which was mainly built in 1952-5. It is typical of the simple, angular architecture typical of its day. External ornamentation is confined to a couple of vertical strips with pierced circles and the compressed hexagonal motifs on the walls and in the doors. The pub was built with a public bar (right) and saloon (left) either side of a central, disused off-sales and doorway to private accommodation. Apparently a \u2018family room\u2019 was added on the left in the 1980s. The two original rooms are simply appointed, the saloon having some wall panelling with imitation marquetry strips, a brick fireplace and contemporary clock above. It was, at some point, expanded into the open porch area shown in the historic photograph. The public bar room is disused, a sign of changing social habits in Roehampton that have led to several pub closures. The counters are original but the saloon bar-back was altered in around 2004.",

The building itself, a three-storey piece of Italianate-style architecture, probably dates from about 1875 but it was given a makeover during the inter-war years, hence the brown and buff tile facing to the ground floor (recently and disgracefully painted over).

The fireplace with small red bricks and the mirror over it, and textured window glass are part of the same scheme, as are the panelled bar counter and the bar-back.\n\nA winding corridor leads round to the public bar at the front. Judging by the three extant and former doorways this would no doubt have been subdivided a century ago. The basic match-board panelling in this room points up the differing furnishing schemes between the front and the back. There is an old cast-iron fireplace in the public bar but the counter there looks like a relatively modern replacement. Sadly the counters of both rooms are disfigured by clumpy, modern pot-shelves.

But between the wars there was an extensive re-modelling so now we have here an interesting combination of Victorian and c.1930 work. The latter is most conspicuously represented by the buff external tiling which was very popular at the time to give pubs a sleek, up-to-date appearance, far removed from the ornate Victorian character displayed in the photograph mentioned above. However, some aspects of the original building were not so easy (or sensible) to efface, hence we have the old Lincrusta ceiling, cast-iron columns, bar counter and central fitting, tiled floor at the Garratt Lane entrance and the screen which splits the pub into two main bars.

The pub was given a total refit about 1930 and still retains its three separate rooms, each of which bears striking brass plates with the name in question \u2013 public bar (on the corner), private bar, and \u2013 perhaps unique \u2013 meal room. The fittings are plain but elegant and there are exposed beams, typical of c. 1930, on the ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe public bar on the corner has a bare wood floor, and a 1930s panelled curved counter with a black and white trough around the base. The bar back fitting also dates from the 1930s with leaded mirrors, but fridge have replaced the lower shelves. There is a dado of fielded panelling around the room, a 1930s grey-painted brick fireplace, with a wood-surround and modern hearth, and some etched and frosted windows remain. Note the cupboards in the bar counter and the three surviving gaslight fittings.\r\n\r\nA widish gap (sliding doors removed) leads to the small room (originally the meal room) on the right which has a bare wood floor with more fielded panelling on the dado. Service is via a small counter to the side of the servery, also with a black and white trough around the base, and a Tudor arch shaped window above the hatch opening which probably had a rising window in the past. It retains a blocked-up 1930s wood surround fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe lounge on the left (originally the private bar) is carpeted, with a 1930s panelled bar counter with original top as well as a 1930s four-bay Tudor arch shaped bar back fitting with leaded mirrors. There are two 1930s wood surround fireplaces but they have radiators in front of them. This room also has 1930s fielded panelling on the dado around two sides of the room, but a more plain modern dado on the front and left hand walls, and a dumb waiter.",

The pub is right opposite Wandsworth Town Station from which the name can be seen writ large in the parapet: it commemorates the Crimean War battle of 1854 and was no doubt built shortly afterwards. The ground floor has vivid green tiling of about 1900. Inside, the large servery sits in the middle of a now wholly opened-up area. The outstanding feature is a series of back-painted mirrors  with flowers, foliage and birds (mainly herons considering their next meal): the mirrors even line the stairs to the upstairs function room. \n\nIn an alcove there is a lovely fireplace with another painted mirror above (note also the original gas-light fittings). The other notable decorative feature is a series of three mosaic roundels  surrounded by flecked grey marble frames and bearing the name of the pub. The woodwork is high-quality work: note the bar counter furthest from the main road \u2013 it\u2019s on a truly gigantic scale. (now a restaurant). Some etched glass also survives in the lobby on the corner and to the former billiard room at the rear. Here there is a deep classical frieze of swirly foliage and naked youths.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020.  A refurbishment has recently been carried and therefore the photos are out of date.\r\nA lavish late-Victorian Young\u2019s pub, rebuilt in 1898 during the great pub boom. It\u2019s a landmark Flemish Renaissance-style three-storey building across the road from the former, much-lamented Young\u2019s Brewery. Ground floor of polished granite with pilasters having decorative capitals and red brick upper storeys. The distinctive and attractive iron and glass canopy which projects from the main entrance across the street seems original. The interior gives a very good idea of what a classy late Victorian pub could look like with extensive expanses of etched glass which makes the place sparkle.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand public bar has entrance doors on the left and also double doors on the right hand side that probably led to a former off sales, in which case a partition has been lost. It retains the original bar back of three bays with large mirror panels but most of the lower bar back shelves have been lost to fridges. The panelled bar counter curved on the left hand side looks original, although unfortunately now considerably shortened. A full height timber and glazed panelled screen forms the division with the room on the right and still retains its door with \u2018Public Bar\u2019 etched and frosted panel; along the middle are etched mirror-glass panels with delicate ribbon and foliage motifs.\r\n\r\nThe room on the right is huge and probably always was a single space (it has a staircase to the toilets and hotel rooms upstairs, cf. the Warrington, Maida Vale); the modest vestibule looks modern. The bar back here is an extension of the mainly glazed partition but with mirror panels also reaching to the ceiling and a doorway for the staff to the public bar. Sadly, most of the lower bar back shelves have been lost to fridges. A door in the bar back leads to what was the original large publican's office, most of which is now an accessible toilet. At the rear there is an indentation in the full height screen with more impressive mirror panels including ones with floral and avian decoration. This small recess has a modern screen separating it from the servery, and contains a table and seating now accessed from the dining area. The panelled bar counter which is curved on the right hand side looks original.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the room is an octagonal skylight, with plain obscured wire glass panes (the coloured stained glass with floral motifs was unfortunately lost during the 2020 refurbishment), below which is a decorative plaster frieze. On either side of the door to the former publican's office are two short screens (approx 2' x 1') with ornate mirror panels depicting flowers. A tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace with a real coal fire may be original.\r\n\r\nAnother full height screen with lots of etched and frosted panels having floral designs along the middle row separates the right hand room from another room at the rear left. It retains two doors both with \u2018Dining Room and Lounge\u2019 deep cut wording in them. This room is almost entirely newly fitted, the exception being the wood surround to the recess mentioned above, and is now used as a dining room.",

The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place.\n\nThe destination pub is nothing new. The Fox & Grapes seems to have been developed to attract visitors to Wimbledon Common in the early 20th century (as it still does). The story starts with the two-storeyed left-hand part which is probably Victorian. It is a low room with full-height match-board wall and also ceiling panelling, and gives a good idea how many a small, plain, outer suburban pub in London must have looked before the use of mass transport and consumerism. The bar counter is a modern addition, however. The left-hand room was the public bar and is a contrast to the \u2018saloon lounge\u2019 on the right. This part is said to have been developed on the site of the former stabling and is probably a re-modelling in the inter-war period to cater for visitors to the Common. It is a deliberate attempt at an \u2018olde worlde\u2019 feel with exposed roof trusses and beams. The window glass is dimpled and has pretty splashes of little green hearts and other decoration. The counter, panelling and fireplace are all well crafted work. The illuminated lettering with the name of the pub probably dates from the 1960s.",

It was built in 1875 and the fittings may well date from that time. Pride of place goes to the extraordinarily tall, eclectically decorated bar-back in the lofty main room. It has five panels of etched and gilded mirrors with swirly foliage, cornucopias and birds in flight: viewed closely the details are a little crude but the overall effect is exotic. High up, over the arched openings is a sequence of mirrored cupboards \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine what they could have been used for. The bar counter is a curvaceous affair with recessed panels. The deeply coffered ceiling is an impressive feature in its own right.\n\r\nIn a subsidiary area behind is another Victorian bar-back, probably reset or brought in. There is some original glass in the doors. This pub was well restored by owners Hall & Woodhouse and reopened in 2003 after a long period of closure. Note the new brass lamps: those on the counter are based on glass spirits dispensers which graced some of the most upmarket Victorian pubs. There is a new mezzanine floor.",

The irregular site gives rise to a three-quarter-round corner and a pair of interestingly shaped rooms inside. The public bar lies in the sharp corner and has plain, match-board panelling to the walls and counter plus a plainish bar-back. But the real star performer at this pub is the saloon with its late-Victorian panelled bar counter and stunning bar-back. This is a beautiful eight-bay affair with two tiers of paired mirrors with orange-coloured detailing. Sitting on top of it are nine porcelain casks for spirits and other drinks: long disused these are named with their former contents, which included Old Tom (a well-known gin), Shrub (lemon or other juice with spirits such as rum), Lovage (liquor made from the seeds of the lovage plant) and Aniseed. The windows contain much etched and cut glass. The lamps over the saloon bar counter are evidently imports, bearing the initials of the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway and thus pre-dating 1923.",

        "Description": "Now very much an upmarket place for a drink and a meal, this was once a simple back-street boozer. It was built about 1830 to serve the needs of the staff from the neighbouring mansions and also thirsty guards from a barracks that was located to the west from about 1762 through to 1835. The pub was originally known as the Guardsman. The plain, three-storey Georgian frontage appears much as it did when originally built (apart from the thoroughly unnecessary application of white paint) with stairs up to the main entrance and a door on the side.\r\n\r\nThe two doors suggest that, small as the pub is, it would have had a couple of separate drinking areas. The fittings are simple and basic as befits what was once an artisan pub \u2013 a match-boarded dado round the walls and match-boarded bar counter. The latter has intriguing traces in the centre part that suggest that the panels were removable. At some later stage a pewter top has been placed on the counter. The two rear rooms have been brought into use in relatively recent years. The left-hand one is dominated by a huge mirror advertising \u2018Mann, Crossman & Paulin Ltd Old and Mild Ales and Stout\u2019 \u2013 a reminder of beer styles that in London have now been largely consigned to history.",

The name commemorates Joseph Paxton who designed the Crystal Palace which once stood nearby. Superlative etched and cut glass can be found lining the walls and in doors and baffles. Motifs include grotesque masks, mythical birds, fruit, flowers and swirling foliage \u2013 all stock features in the repertoire of contemporary pub glass designs.

        "Description": "This busy pub between Harrod\u2019s and the V&A Museum (hence usually crowded with tourists) was put up in 1844: it has three storeys and is now rather dwarfed by neighbouring 20th-century buildings. What is of interest for us here are the fairly substantial vestiges of a late-Victorian refitting. Pride of place goes to a series of back-painted mirrors. The first is in the left hand lobby and shows grapes hanging off a vine above various flowers. The mirrors continue with four on the left-hand wall showing birds and all sorts of vegetation, followed by a half size then full size plain mirrors with simple design round the edges. They are signed \u2018W James of Kentish Town\u2019 and date from 1890.\n\r\nIt is possible to get a sense of the way the pub was laid out a century ago. The servery is in the middle (surrounded with a black and white diamond shaped tile area of later period, as there are no marks to indicate separate rooms or divisions) and two remaining fragments of screens that would have divided the pub up into a series of separate drinking areas remain at the front, but these may have been cut back. Possibly there would have been a partition creating a corridor down the left hand side i.e. where the back painted mirrors are situated, which could have accessed the the rear bar. There is one full height screen on the left and another on the rear right - both with doorways, not doors. There is a short screen on the front right but the three-quarter height screen on the rear left is a modern addition.\n\r\nParticularly notable is the row of five snob screens on the left-hand side of the servery with representations of birds and, of course, bunches of grapes. The area where they are located is demarcated by a gross head-height baffle carved with truly gargantuan clusters of grapes.\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs with snob screens are Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham; Prince Alfred, London W9;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Starting Gate, London N22;  Crown, London N1; and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but these have been moved.\n\r\nFurther historic features are the cast-iron columns with gold painted decorative capitals supporting the upstairs floors and extensive etched glass including a Bottles & Jug' window. There is a vestibule around the front right entrance.\n\r\nThe Victorian island bar back fitting has some modern additions on the front and at the rear and practically all the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. Note the delicate ceiling feature above the back fitting. The bar counter is a sloping one - a style more popular in the inter-war period - the panelled counter at the rear with plain brackets is possibly inter-war.",

The building itself is Victorian but the fittings are a surprisingly complete array from the inter-war refit which provided two distinct rooms, the evidence of which is still apparent today with the public bar (named on the door) at the front. The room separation is most obvious in the remains of a screen, the glazed top of which survives. Then you will see that the bar counter is treated differently \u2013 at the front it is match-boarded and at the back (the plusher end) it has horizontal Art Deco panelling with a rounded corner. The bar-backs, however, are similar and there is also a black-and-white tiled spittoon trough.\r\n\r\nAlso from the 1930s are the fixed seating and three brick fire surrounds each with a small terracotta relief \u2013 a galleon, a hunting scene and a frisky stag. There is wall panelling in the rear area with advertisements for Truman\u2019s wares and a promotional mirror over one of the fireplaces.

Inside you can now perambulate through the whole pub but can still get a good sense of the way it was originally arranged. The public bar was at the front and more simply appointed than the more upmarket rear areas, e.g. a match-board counter in contrast to the panelled ones behind \u2013 note all the counters have doors for servicing the original beer engines as was usual in Truman\u2019s 1930s pubs. The light-coloured oak woodwork is typical of the colouration and quality of what they put into their pubs, as is the distinctive advertising lettering in the bar-backs, the chequerwork spittoon trough in the rear area, the use of mirrors over the fireplaces and the (now disappeared) sliding screen that would have split the rear parts. The inglenook with Tudor-arched fireplace and adjacent seating is particularly attractive.  \n\nUnusually cellar access for deliveries is inside the pub with access via two wooden doors underneath one of the mullioned windows. A notable feature is the extensive rear garden approached down a passage at the rear and which shows how inter-war pub builders had in mind the need to encourage not just hardened drinkers but couples and families who might enjoy sitting out in good weather.",

Yet it does retain a great deal of its original late-Victorian layout, glass and, remarkably, screenwork. It can be approached either from Princedale Road or from an entry on Pottery Lane. From either direction you are faced with a fine display of etched, patterned glass. From the Pottery Lane side there are two huge windows with the Prince of Wales\u2019s feathers and his motto \u2018Ich Dien\u2019 (I serve). There are also doors with glass naming the rooms to which they led \u2013 public bar (right) and saloon bar (left). The Princedale Road side has two doors specifying \u2018saloon bar\u2019.

No doubt there was an ornate stillion in the centre of the servery but, sadly, most of this has been stripped out. The interior space is divided up by a couple of screens with etched glass, a rare feature for a pub that kept up with late 20th-century change. The door glass names do not fully make sense today (\u2018saloon bar\u2019 and \u2018public bar\u2019 glass lead to a single space) so we may imagine that more screenwork once divided the pub up into three small areas of the type so loved by Victorian drinkers.",

The front drinking area wraps round the servery on three sides and is still little altered since a refit in the late 1950s/early 1960s with a bar counter faced with slices of tree trunks on the front. This is one example of what has sometimes been called \u2018publican\u2019s rustic\u2019, a deliberate attempt at rustic nostalgia with chunky woodwork, false ceiling beams and rough stonework. Also remaining is the mirrored bar back with glass shelves and a copper canopy of a c.1960s style. \r\n\r\nMost surprising is the reused carved woodwork from old pieces of furniture. It seems that when such heavy, overblown carving was deeply out of fashion it could be bought up cheaply and so pieces found their way here, were dismantled and used to adorn the pub, particularly on the right hand side of the public bar. Some wall panelling is now painted black and the panelled ceiling is now painted a deep pink colour. The stone fireplace on the left hand side looks modern. \r\n\r\nThere is a gap to a small area on the right with a stone fireplace that looks modern. There are the odd chair / stool that are more examples of \u2018publican\u2019s rustic\u2019; also a lovely old high backed settle. A gap to the area on the left on a higher level has a carved wood counter front from 1950/60s. Furniture includes carved chairs and table and also a \u2018publican\u2019s rustic\u2019 stool. The coffee station is situated on another piece of old furniture. Gents has a 1950s urinal but modern tiling. \r\n\r\nMajor changes at the rear created a number of areas and a patio.",

The other feature that can be spotted outside is the pretty stained and painted glass borders to the lower parts of the windows which include representations of Michaelmas daisies. In the heads of the windows you can also make out delicate filigree piercing. The tiled walls have a yellow ochre-coloured dado, above which is an early type of Art Nouveau frieze, and, then, on the upper part of the walls, a series of panels divided by wooden pilasters. Each panel has an ornamented mirror set within a wooden frame. The colouration of this upper tiling is unique and is a warm mixture of beige, buff and red. Near the side entrance is a splendid advertising mirror promoting the wares of Pocock & Pearce of Pancras Road who tell us they are the sole proprietors of Paddy Liqueur Irish Whisky and \u2018The Nurse\u2019s\u2019 brand of bottled beers. There is a little vignette in the centre of \u2018Paddy and Polly\u2019 cavorting about, seemingly drunk.",

        "Pub Name": "Guinea",
        "Address": "30 Bruton Place, London, Mayfair, W1J 6NL",
        "Description": "Although operating as a Grill restaurant, it has a bar and is worth a visit to see the low screen still with a door, a rare survival of the way Victorian pubs were subdivided. The interior is little-changed since 1952 and three small dining rooms are well worth a visit if you plan your visit at a quiet time. \r\n\r\nRebuilt 1741 and licensed in 1754, this Young\u2019s pub, in a back street in the heart of Mayfair, occupies a three-storey building of London brick with a prominent oriel window on the first floor. They claim it is \u2018London\u2019s original steakhouse since 1952 and it has two small rooms at the rear that have probably long been in pub use a long time. Bar staff say the interior is \u201cunchanged since 1939\u201d. Front windows have \u2018Wines\u2019, \u2018The Guinea\u2019 and \u2018Spirits\u2019 etched panels, which look like replacements. The right hand door has a \u2018lounge bar\u2019 etched glass panel and leads to the main bar. The left hand front door has an etched \u2018Private Bar\u2019 panel, the front inner door has \u2018Restaurant\u2019 and if you enter this in the evenings expect to be met by a \u2018penguin\u2019!\r\n\r\nThe main bar is L-shaped with a bare wood floor, old, possibly Victorian, panelled bar counter with console brackets all along it. The counter curves to the right where it is U-shaped. The bar back is fairly plain so could be 1930s work and has a small piece on the right return. The lower shelving remains on the return side but has been lost at the front. The ceiling is panelled and painted but a small rear part has a plain plaster one; added to other signs in the ceiling it looks like there was at some time a partition on the right hand side / a screen between the front and rear areas, but the date of its removal is unknown. \r\n\r\nInside the left hand door there is the very rare survival of a low screen, which separates a tiny part of the front bar on the left-hand side from the main bar on the right. Screens like this were once absolutely standard equipment in thousands of London pubs. The three bay screen still retains its door (however, recent photos show it has been taken off and re-instated), which has a sliding bolt on the \u2018restaurant\u2019 side. A tiny metal \u2018loop\u2019 allows you to open the door and go through to the main bar. Two of the bays \u2013 the nearest to the servery and the door - have narrow etched and frosted panels in the top; also, there is a tiny partition siting on the bar counter top with a frosted glazed panel. \r\n\r\nOn the left, from the front small section of the bar through a doorway with a Tudor arch there is a small room with lots of steaks in a display cabinet like that seen in a butchers shop from which customers can select their own cuts as they enter - they are cooked on the grill behind. Some steaks are so big they are for sharing! Continuing back through another a doorway with a Tudor arch there is a small dining room, always been part of the pub, and has very old dado panelling all around it. \r\n\r\nIn 1952 a flat roof extension was added at the rear right and an additional dining room opened in it. It too has dado panelling all around it that looks almost identical to that in the left-hand dining room but it only dates from 1952. \r\n\r\nFrom the rear of the right hand main bar is a passage to the rear dining rooms (and toilets (modernised), also a staircase to the first floor which has modern dado panelling. On the first floor at the front is what is called the \u2018Boardroom\u2019 which incorporates the oriel window. This small dining room has full height old panelling all around it dating from c1900, a marble surround fireplace with ornate decoration, and just one large oval table. If paying a visit at a quite time (they encourage visitors to tour the building) when in the upstairs room ask to see the mini bar cupboard!",

It has now been turned into a single drinking space, yet it is still well worth a visit for its collection of surviving, excellent late-Victorian fixtures and fittings. The panelled bar counter seems original and behind it is a magnificent five-bay back-fitting with etched and gilded mirrors with the sprays of flowers and foliage that were so popular with pub fitters of the day. Yet, without doubt, the most appealing part of the pub is the left-hand side with its wood-panelled walls, more etched and gilded mirrors, and delightful ceramic panels. In the front area are three elongated panels of ladies and gents on horseback. The rear area has the air of a gentleman\u2019s club, fully panelled to the ceiling and decorated with mirrors and tiles with beautifully realised painted hunting dogs and a stag \u2013 the pub\u2019s patrons probably aspired to such a way of life.\r\n\r\nA sympathetic refurbishment prior to the pub's reopening in 2022 has left the heritage features unaffected.",

        "Address": "24 Craven Terrace, Paddington, W2 3QH",
        "Description": "Despite much wall and screen removal, there is still much of interest to see here, especially in the fine glasswork, probably from a late Victorian fitting. Built 1859, the Mitre occupies a triangular corner site and has an unusual pair of slightly curved doors at the angle, leading to a little lobby where the pub name appears on the inner door. Before going in, the windows are worth a look for the unusual ironwork in the uprights and Gothic style tracery. Very sadly the glass has been replaced with plain sheets.\nThe most impressive work is on the right-hand side with mosaic flooring at the entrance to a short corridor, which stretches back into two more floor panels. In this area on the left is an excellent display of etched, cut and orange-coloured glass, including door panels advertising the \"private bar\" and the \"ladies only\" snug room. This shows how some pubs at the end of the 19th century were starting to provide a secure environment for respectable women who previously would have regarded the pub as completely out of bounds. Other glass advertises a billiard room (which seems to have been upstairs) and a saloon, which has a small skylight. The right hand wall of this corridor is tiled to picture rail height, including wood-framed mirrors.\nThe bar-back in the main room is an attractive piece, with a protruding dumb waiter that is still in use, numerous cut glass panels, and with the finer detail of the woodwork picked out in gold. The canted forward bar counter here includes square frames with vertical wood panels in them, and a wood-framed staff entranceway on the left leads to a small servery in the saloon bar at the back.",

        "Address": "434 Chiswick High Road, Chiswick, W4 5TF",
        "Description": "An exuberant architectural extravaganza of 1910 to designs by the prolific T H Nowell Parr for Fuller, Smith & Turner who still own it (it also doubles as a Thai restaurant). The Edwardian free-style exterior is enriched with lots of brown fa\u00efence on the ground floor and more interesting detail in the floors above. Three original rooms are still clearly discernible and retain their names in the etched window glass (some of it gently curved). Easily the best space is the saloon bar (on Acton Lane) with its panelling and delightful alcove and original fireplace, which sits behind a Tudor arch. Such arches are a Parr favourite (as elsewhere in this pub). The counter in the saloon is original too and has highly unusual detailing, while the surround of the bar-back is also of 1910 although the centre part is, unfortunately, modern work. There are traces of doors in the counter that enabled the servicing of handpumps in days gone by. \n\nRound the corner the main bar-back, facing Chiswick High Road, is original as is the main run of the counter. The counter in the area on the corner of the pub is a crude cobbling together of old and new elements. On this side of the pub there is a division separating it into two but this was adapted at a refurbishment in 2017 which modified the opening between them with an utterly crass, industrial-feel treatment with deliberately visible steel joists. A visual disgrace. All the rooms in the pub have another Parr characteristic \u2013 exposed wooden studding and beams. Don\u2019t miss the stained glass pack horses in the public and saloon bar upper windows and Fuller\u2019s symbol, the griffin in stone relief above the corner door on two sides. One of the redundant doorways in the pub must have served as an off-sales. \n\nOn the right through a wide opening in a part glazed screen there is a snug area with a Victorian-style fireplace and good short partitions (modern?). Beyond a folding screen is a restaurant area added in a flat-roofed extension built in the early 2000s.",

        "Pub Name": "Dove",
        "Address": "19 Upper Mall, Hammersmith, W6 9TA",
        "Description": "Celebrated far and wide, the Fuller\u2019s owned Dove overlooks the Thames and is approached by a narrow alley from the river. It was probably built in the early to mid-18th century and then refronted in the 19th. Its amazingly tiny snug, with match-boarded counter and fixed wall benches, is claimed by the Guinness World Records as the smallest public bar in Britain. However, research by beer writer Martyn Cornell suggests it may not be as old as one might think. He believes it was installed some time after 1911 by the then licensee who thought his single-room, fully licensed premises contravened the Licensing Consolidation Act of 1910 and so he created the diminutive snug to rectify matters. However, he needn\u2019t have bothered, Cornell argues, since, if a single-room, fully licensed house had existed before 1872 (as was the case with the Dove), the Act did not make it a necessity to put in a second room. However, had you been drinking here on 7 January 1928 you\u2019d have been waist-high in water judging by a small brass plaque recording that day\u2019s mighty inundation. The other front room is historic too in terms of its wall seating and counter.\n\r\nSome of the woodwork here, along with that in the vestibule, might even go back to the 18th century and, if so, could be some of the earliest purpose-built pub fittings around. Post-war repairs in 1948 saw the addition of the substantial brick fireplace with its exuberant Portland stone carving of the dove returning to Noah\u2019s Ark with an olive branch. The rear room at the Dove is modern but the terrace beyond overlooking the Thames is a delightful place to enjoy a drink on a fine day.",

        "Description": "A popular Fuller\u2019s pub, which is often very busy as much of its clientele is attracted by the excellent Thai food. It was built in the Victorian era but given a complete internal refit between the wars. There would have been separate rooms, of course, at that time but all the partitions have gone leaving a U-shaped drinking area. But most of the rest of the c.1930 work survives. The windows are very attractive with their canted bays and charming stained glass details. Then there is the bar counter, most of which has panels with triple mouldings round it, though the smaller, right-hand counter is much plainer. This makes it clear that the bars must have been separated by a partition and, if you look closely, you can see in the window-sill a small piece of patching where the old screen stood. The walls are extensively panelled and there are a couple of pretty tiled fireplaces. \r\n\r\nThere are also two sets of snob-screens mounted on the counter: what age they are is a moot point. When the present licensee came in the mid-1980s they formed a continuous run but it\u2019s hard to believe such an intrusive feature would have been put in during the 1930s when people favoured unencumbered counters. It\u2019s likely they were a later restoration.",

There were two doors from the vestibule (one no longer in use) indicating the present bare wooden floored public bar was original two rooms.

The core of the pub is the part with doors embellished with etched and gilded glass, declaring \u2018private counter\u2019 (on the left) and \u2018general counter\u2019 (right). These names are probably unique, certainly in the experience of the writers, and correspond to the more commonly used \u2018private bar\u2019 and \u2018public bar\u2019. So there were evidently two separate areas fronting on to a common servery and divided, no doubt, by a timber screen. The counter (a plain affair) and bar-back are Victorian and the coloured advertising panels in the head of the latter are typical of the period around 1870-1890. The pub expanded into a right-hand area and recently has experienced further growth on the left into the next-door building to form a cosy drinking area called the \u2018Wig Box\u2019. Imagine the pub without these extensions and you can get a sense of just how small it was in Victorian days. There are three fine old advertising mirrors.",

The pub is part of the Savoy Court complex built in 1903-4 to designs by a well-known Edwardian architect T E Collcutt. Expense was not spared in creating a lofty, beamed L-shaped drinking hall whose main decorative theme is the celebration of the fruit of the vine. In a massive, deep frieze there are decorative young ladies collecting grapes in an agreeable state of undress. At the rear of the pub is an exuberant terracotta fireplace decorated with juicy bunches of grapes and an escutcheon with the uplifting motto \u2018convivium moderatum atque honestum\u2019 (loosely translated as an exhortation to honesty and what we now refer to as \u2018responsible drinking\u2019). The bar-back with its flat-arched openings and simply panelled counter is original though the obtrusive gantries stuck on the corners are an unpleasant modern addition. \r\n\r\nDo go upstairs to the mezzanine floor from where you can get a bird\u2019s eye view of this spectacular pub and its sumptuous features. The pub claims to take its name from being a popular hostelry for London coal heavers who used to fuel the city before the arrival of natural gas. There is also a small, windowless snug in the basement which purports to be the pub\u2019s coal hole.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nA real landmark hotel-cum-pub of 1896, dramatically designed for a fork in the road and dominated by three great, radiating gables. The architect was Alfred Board of Croydon and his clients the local brewers, Page & Overton who finally ceased production in 1954. Their name is prominently displayed and they were no doubt very pleased with their mighty new pub. Back in 1896 there would have been numerous internal divisions. These have gone but the counter and rather plain bar-back are original. But what really makes the visit worthwhile is a rather later addition \u2013 the cosy, low snug at the rear dating from perhaps around 1910. It lies behind a wide opening, above which are lovely stained glass representations of two swans and a loaf of sugar. This curious little space has a mighty Jacobean style fire surround in brown faience (pity about the out-of-keeping modern copper hood). Either side of this are six highly unusual seats that make the place feel like the drinkers\u2019 version of a chapter house in an abbey. On the walls there are a number of historic photographs of the pub.",

Outside the ground floor is distinguished with brown glazed brick, a band of blue-grey mottled fa\u00efence and some attractive designs in the window frames. The pub consists of two rooms. The public bar, entered off Field Lane, is by far the smaller of the two while the saloon stretches back along Bridgeman Road. There is a modern arched cut-through between the two rooms. Both of them have some delightfully detailed glazing with pretty green leaves and other motifs, though, sadly, the main windowpanes are now plain glass.\n\n\nBoth rooms also have beamed ceilings which were popular at the time to create a kind of \u2018olde worlde\u2019 effect. The public bar has a rather unusual semi-circular-shaped counter and an individualistically detailed bar-back. The counter in the saloon is straight and, with the bar-back, looks as though it might be an inter-war replacement. A prominent Tudor-style arch spans the width of the saloon. A charming detail not to be missed is the Art Nouveau-style spear-like recesses carved in the panelling which are probably a unique feature in pub ornamentation. There are two original fireplaces.",

A crank in the road outside means the pub tapers inwards as it stretches back, making for some unusual spaces. The exterior is a symmetrical composition with buff tile facing below and half-timbering above. Another favourite \u2013 rippled glass in the windows \u2013 survives in good measure. There has been some opening up so you can now circumnavigate the central serving area. But, nonetheless, there is still a very good impression to be gained of how the pub was laid out originally. On the left there is the lounge and on the right the public bar, although we were told that originally the functions were reversed. Between the two, at the front, was an off-sales compartment, now merged into the public bar. One of its screens still survives and this has a low access door for staff. In terms of furnishings, the dominant theme is wooden wall panelling to create the \u2018olde worlde\u2019 feel of \u2018brewers\u2019 Tudor\u2019.

It overlooks an attractive green which is much used by pub customers in decent weather. The pub has expanded mightily in recent times, not least due to the grafting on of a hotel on the right-hand side. However, it does still have separate rooms and, if you mentally block out the large dining room at the rear, quite a lot of the atmosphere from a refitting in the 1930s. \n\nAt that time there were four pub rooms, all of which are still clearly traceable. The most complete is the public bar, a plainly furnished room on the corner which has an original curved bar counter. The main area consists of three interlinked spaces. The front one, with the main entrance, has a delightful little snug leading off it, complete with panelling, marble fire surround and a 1930s counter. Right off the entrance is a large panelled area where the most unusual feature is a 1930s clock with screwed-on numbers. Behind, the rear area is dark and dominated by heavy timbers which are tooled to create the \u2018olde worlde\u2019 look that was so popular among pub-builders and pub-goers between the wars: it also has a brick fire surround with a Tudor arch.",

The bar counter is in the same position but the panelled front is modern and painted a dark blue colour. The plentiful modern panelling on the walls at the rear is also painted dark blue. The snob screens have been retained but now sit totally out of position above the modern bar back.\n\nThe former description is shown below. \n\nA delightful, small, no-nonsense pub situated in an early 19th-century three-storey building on the main road out of Woodford Green heading for Epping Forest. It is said to have been licensed for beer and port sales in 1832. Outside is a fine, curly bracket for the pub lantern. Inside, three bars have been combined into one forming a U-shape round the servery and the stairs up to the living accommodation. The plain, boarded counter and the bar-back are hard to date and, parts at least, may be earlier than the inter-war remodelling that lends the pub its main character. The latter involves fielded panelling along the side and back walls and brick fireplaces on either side. The revamp may date from a time when a full licence was granted. Note the four stubs in the left-hand part of the bar-back which are the relics from taps said to have served port by gravity from casks overhead. A further feature of interest is the bank of five snob screens on the left-hand side of the bar counter. They cannot be in situ since the counter front below has evidence of former access to the serving area. There is modern etched glass in the front windows. The counter has a panel which could be removed to allow for servicing the beer engines in former times.\n\nOther Heritage Pubs with snob screens are Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham; Prince Alfred, London W9;  Lamb, London WC1;  Posada, Wolverhampton , West Midlands;  Gate, London N22;  Bunch of Grapes, London SW3;  Crown, London N1; and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but these have been moved.",

        "Address": "697 Uxbridge Rd, Hayes End, UB4 8HX",
        "Description": "A neo-Georgian inter-war roadhouse on the south side of the busy Uxbridge Road leading out of Hayes. It was re-built in 1926 by architect T H Nowell Parr for Fuller\u2019s Brewery - a picture of the previous pub hangs in the saloon. It was extended in 1937 at the rear on the right-hand side to create a function room. The former off-sales still survives in the middle of the symmetrical facade, between the two front bars. Remarkably all four original bars survive, clustered round a central servery. When the pub was built, they were all relatively small and of not dissimilar size. The little-altered interior is, no doubt, mainly due to the fact that it was run by the same licensee from 1967 to 2010. This is probably the reason why it has a little-altered interior and has been referred to as 'the pub Fuller's forgot.' \n\nThe front saloon bar accessed from the right hand door with a glazed vestibule entrance has as its key feature a large brick original fireplace (sadly painted white). This popular room retains its original quarter circle panelled counter with outward-opening cupboards \u2013 only seen in the London area they are apparently for inspecting pipework and beer engine maintenance. Sadly, canopies have been added over the counter here and elsewhere. The walls are covered in plaster with uprights regularly spaced along the dado and painted brown to look like half-timbering topped by a crenellated top rail. Some of the loose furniture must surely be inter-war. \n\nThe front public bar accessed from the front left-hand door with a glazed vestibule entrance has another original quarter-circle panelled counter with cupboards that can still be opened (the canopy above is a c.1970 addition). The original bar-back fitting has a doorway for staff in the second of four bays and the third bay has seen some change. The original fireplace remains and is mostly of cast iron, grained to imitate hardwood but it has a modern interior. The walls are covered in plaster with uprights regularly spaced along the dado and painted brown to look like half-timbering topped by a cornice of genuine wood. The original metal window openers in this room still work and are used in hot weather! \n\nThrough a double width doorway (original doors lost) leads to what was originally the Meal Room and did not have a bar counter when built. On the right is a sealed up door that has a hatch in it \u2013 beyond the wall is a passage that includes a dumb waiter, which brought down meals cooked in the first floor kitchen and they were handed through the hatch. This room also retains its original fireplace of cast iron and painted brown to look like wood but with a modern interior and the walls have more of the plaster uprights on the dado and painted brown to look like half-timbering topped by a crenellated top rail. The bar counter here looks like it was added in the 1960s. The gents' urinals date from 1926 and when built customers had to access by leaving from the rear left door and entering from the rear i.e. outside roofless gents\u2019! The gents\u2019 WC and ladies\u2019 were added probably post war. \n\nThe off sales remains with its door in the centre front of the pub flanked by what were once display windows; its bar counter is intact and it shares the front left-hand bar-back fitting but is now used as a storage area. There is an attractive glazed timber screen spanning the servery between the front public bar and facing the lounge. Beyond the bar back fitting the original manager\u2019s office is still in use today \u2013 it has a glazed door and a series of windows overlooking the bars, including a special cashier\u2019s window through which cash was passed back to be placed in the safe which is in situ but not used as they have lost the key! Another original fitting is the fire extinguisher situated at the top of the cellar steps! In the cellar is the original hand wound hoist which is still in use today for bottling-up (taking crates of bottles from the cellar to the bar to place on shelves). The dumb waiter which connects to the cellar below and former kitchen above remains. \n\nThe rear right room, originally the luncheon room, is now the function room. When built in 1926 it was the same size as the rear left \u2018meal room\u2019 and it had no bar fittings. Then in 1936 plans were drawn to extend backwards the luncheon room by some 50%: this was flanked on two sides by a verandah (as the earlier, smaller luncheon room had been). The extent of the original 1926 building was the large pillar on the right. The room was then remodelled in c.1970 - it was extended to take in the footprint covered by the verandah: square piers are left over from the 1930s walling, presumably for structural reasons to save rebuilding the entire roof and with (it seems) the Crittall casement windows reset. The 1937 extent of the room is clearly visible by looking at the ceiling \u2013 the stage is situated in the c.1970 part. The whole room has fielded panelling to dado height and that on the rear wall could be from 1937. There is an excellent Art Deco colourful leaded glass roof-light in the 1937 part of the ceiling. The canted bar counter here was added in 1937 and also includes doors that can still be opened. The mirrored bar-back fitting also dates from 1937. There is another 1926 fireplace mostly of cast iron and painted brown to look like wood but it has a modern interior. The ceiling here (and also in the other rooms) have exposed beams (now all painted in a uniform colour) and this arrangement continues into the extended part of the function room, showing an attempt to match the existing work that would not be expected in post-war work. \n\nOn the  first floor in the licensee's private quarters the original kitchen at the rear left (now the living room) still retains its fitted cupboards and the drying rail with pulleys that was used to dry table cloths etc. Also in this room is the Georgian-style built-in sideboard that contained crockery, cutlery etc. that resided in the meal room when the pub opened \u2013 it has the lead lined drawer for the storage of wine. On the first floor hall is the pianola that was originally in the public bar and they still have some scrolls. On the front left upstairs is the Masons Room, which has been used by the local lodge every Monday night since the pub opened in 1926! It was also used by the Buffaloes until the 1960s and has the Roll of Honour for \u2018The Industrial Lodge No. 177\u2019 on the wall and the regalia cupboard with both doors having the gold lettering of the founder in 1913 and the list of \u2019Certified Primos\u2019. This room has a 1930s Art Deco tiled fireplace and original Bakelite plugs and switches but recently the original door with its peep hole has been replaced by a modern \u2018fire door\u2019. The room is available for meetings. \n\nOn the right hand side of the pub there was a club room when the pub was built in 1926 but it was demolished in 1937 when the luncheon room was extended \u2013 the land is still owned by Fuller's and let to store fairground rides. \n\nIt is possible to arrange a tour of the pub at quiet times if arranged in advance with the licensee.",

To the rear of the servery on the public bar side the original publicans office remains formed by full height screens with leaded glazing and still retaining its door. Of the gents\u2019 at the rear of the public bar only the original floor to ceiling glazed white bricks and terrazzo floor remain (the three large original urinals have been removed). The former passage at the rear with its dado of fielded panelling is now doubled in size.\n\r\nA leaded glazed partition wall separates the public bar from the saloon bar on the right \u2013 the doors within it are folded back. The saloon bar is shown on the original plan as \u2018lounge and smoke room\u2019 at the front and a dining room at the rear. This spacious room retains its entrance lobby screen with leaded transoms and original doors, original stone Tudor-arched fire surround, two dumb waiters, (the folding screen to the rear hall has been removed) and a parquet floor throughout. The central servery bar counter is original but with a new top, and the bar back too is modern. A transom with leaded lights and carved Tudor rose decoration divide the servery. The pot shelf over the counter is modern work. Original fielded panelling to picture frame height on the walls remains. The ladies' are at the back of the room where the screen to the Function Room was and the gents' have been moved from the front\u202f room to the rear room to where the Ladies were first located, both have original terrazzo floors but otherwise modernised. A distracting feature however are the\u202f stainless-steel \u202fheating pipes suspended from the ceiling in both rooms.\u202f\n\r\nBeyond the screen at the rear of the smoke room is what is now the Function Room shown on the original plan as lounge and recreation room. This\u202f has been totally modernised with new floor and a glass atrium roof. It still retains its original bar (though the front counter looks new) with glazed screen to the \u202fleft-hand side and bar back both upper and lower. Look for the illuminated fitting above labelled \u201cCourage\u201d, \u201cFellowship Inn Discotheque\u201d installed in the 1960s. Henry Cooper, the boxer, practised here in 1963 prior to his fight with Cassius Clay (later Muhammed Ali) and later it became a famous music venue in the 1960s hosting gigs by Fleetwood Mac and John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers.\n\r\nDownstairs (accessible now by a lift) is the old theatre/cinema now called the \u201cBellingham Picture Palace\u201d. This\u202fhas also been totally modernised retaining the \u202fwonderful art deco style with a sloping floor and plush seats. The small bar on the\u202fright-hand\u202fside remains with its original rolling shutter in place. The lower hall main entrance lobby retains its\u202foriginal doors, entrance screen and monochrome floor tiling. There is an Admission Box in the foyer, which survives as does \u202fthe cloakroom fittings. There is also a smaller lobby in the north-east corner.\n\r\nOn the lower level on\u202f Knapmill\u202f Street is the timber shop front of the large off-sales (described as outdoor service and order office on the original plan), now converted into the \u201cMilky Way Bar & Caf\u00e9\u201d; it also acts as the ticket office for the new cinema. Currently only non-alcoholic drinks are available \u202fhere. Only the original serving counter remains.",

        "Address": "240 St John Street, London, Finsbury, EC1V 4PH",
        "Description": "Three-storey pub of red brick rebuilt 1889-90 to the design of H.J. Newton. The ground floor has a timber pub front, granite dado, pedimented entrances with richly ornamented tympana and spandrels. At the top of the building is a balustraded parapet; also central semi-circular pediment to west and north elevation. The pediments have dormers with round-headed windows and stone relief decoration with roundels bearing the figure of St George. Corner bay surmounted by dormer. \r\n\r\nThe decorative mosaic floor indicates the pub was originally divided into seven distinct compartments separated by partitions. There were originally four exterior doors. The mosaic floor indicates that off the former lobby/passage on the left there were two snugs at the rear. Also, there were two snugs to the right of the present entrance. The room on the rear right has changed \u2013 the mosaic floor indicates a new wall has been added to create a passage at the rear of the pub. The decorative mosaic by the right-hand door includes a dragon, grapes etc. \r\n\r\nFrom the front left-hand door a lobby created by a partition ran to the rear. As you enter there is a decorative \u2018THE GEORGE AND DRAGON' in mosaic. The left hand wall has floor to ceiling tiling including a splendid multi-coloured large tiled painting depicting St George slaying the dragon with a relief-pattern tiled dado below by Webb and Company of 94 Euston Road. If you take a close look at the horse's head you will see a rosette and around it a cracked tile - this is damage from shrapnel in WWII and the rosette painted on to cover it up. The tiling may continue beneath modern timber dado to rear. At the rear near the staircase to the first floor the mosaic tile floor also incorporates a St George slaying the dragon scene. Above the left hand side there is a fibrous plaster ceiling of intersecting circles and what looks like a skylight. \r\n\r\nThe original curved bar counter survives in its original position apart from a small straight section on the right-hand side, as indicated by the mosic floor. Here there is a modern replacement which is very similar in style. The original bar-back fitting has been retained. Behind the bar back fitting there is the original Publican's Office with the door on the far left of the servery \u2013 the mosaic floor indicates there have been no changes to the layout. The mosaic floor also confirms that the present corner vestibule entrance is a later addition. \r\n\r\nThe upstairs bare wood floored dining room has a bar back where the lower part looks modern but the upper part is an elegant mirrored fitting with glass shelves and possibly imported. There is a largish metal fireplace with old fireback and a decorative plaster cornice.",

        "Address": "Station Square, Petts Wood, BR5 1LZ",
        "Description": "Development of Petts Wood started in the 1920s and the pub probably dates from that time The exterior has black and white half timbering on the upper storey, and red brick on the lower, with wonderful chimney stacks. The pub appears to have made into one large room at some time as there are three distinct ceiling styles. The first is plaster with moulded plaster cornices decorated with birds and vines and unusual embossed plaster representations of flowers such as thistles and lilies and a Charrington Toby symbol adorning the walls below the cornices. The second has a wooden beamed ceiling, the third plaster panels. Inside there is fielded wooden wall panelling and leaded windows. The fireplaces are of red brick, some with twisted brick columns.   \r\n\r\nThe servery has a half-timbered canopy which looks more modern but the bar-back has more convincing Tudor-arched detail. Part of the bar counter has also been replaced with the same half timbered panelling as the canopy. Note also the charming plaster panels in the main room depicting fairies frolicking among trees and various birds and animals, including a frog.   \r\n\r\nDouble wooden doors at the right hand end of the L shaped bar lead to a magnificent function room with a fine barrel roof. This room also contains a small corner bar. At quiet times it is possible to arrange a visit to the function room but it is best to ring ahead. Outside there is a Charrington Toby ceramic plaque over one of the entrance doors. The pubs unusual name comes from local resident William Willett who campaigned for daylight saving time in the early part of the Twentieth century.   \r\n\r\nThe Public Bar and Smoke Room on the left were combined in the 1980s \u2013 the Snug bar on the right still remains as a separate room linked by two doorways to the left hand bar. In 1980s when the bar and smoke room were combined new bar fittings were installed in all rooms \u2013 this is confirmed by looking at the servery in the Function Room (which is obviously a later addition after part of the Function Room was lost to form a kitchen) - it is identical to all the others. The bar back fitting with carved leaf feature in the top left and right corners of each bay looks very similar to the original style in the top of doorways but is different.   \r\n\r\nThe bar counter front does look to be of a style suitable for 1935 (or 1950s) but if you look at the ladies and gents doors and run your hand over the panelling it has a smooth finish whereas that on the counter front and on some wall panelling (& the Disabled Toilet door) have a notable rougher finish.",

Now a single room, the tiled floor running down the right hand side indicates it was originally two rooms separated by partitions with the door to the rear room where the tiled floor ends. There is a colourful Victorian tiled dado of mainly turquoise with narrow ceramic bands of mainly brown and some blue at the top running along the right hand wall and above it four\u00a0large Victorian mirrors in good wood surrounds and a tiled cornice frieze. The bar counter is old but its sloping panelled front makes it look more inter-war than Victorian but the bar back of more good mirrors in wooden surrounds and old shelves looks Victorian. The\u00a0tiles near the hatch to the cellar are modern, possibly from a 1989\u00a0refurbishment. At the rear of the room is a Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace, a skylight above and an alcove/small area on the rear left created by removing some of a wall to the left of the fireplace.",

Brutton.\n\r\nIt has a splendid set of tiled paintings - four Doulton's of Lambeth tiled panels with Shakespearean scenes and two others depicting hops and a vine. An error seems to have been introduced into one of the former: the words quoted from 'Henry IV Part 2' are not spoken by Bardolph but by Silence (one of the justices). 'The Merry Wives of Windsor' is represented by a suitably corpulent Falstaff sporting a set of antlers. A dashing Prince Henry addresses Falstaff in the third scene, from 'Henry IV Part 1. In the fourth, the court jester Touchstone woos the goat-girl Audrey from 'As You Like It': interestingly, apart from exchanging stripy apparel for a red outfit, the figure is the same as the jester at the Feuars Arms, Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland.\n\r\nOther magnificent displays of tiled paintings can be found at Caf\u00e9 Royal, Edinburgh, Scotland; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; General Havelock, Hastings, East Sussex; Central Bar, Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rose Villa Tavern, Hockley, Birmingham; Dolphin, Hackney, London E8; and Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales.",

        "Description": "The Tabard dates back to 1880 and was a pioneering 'improved' pub built as part of the Bedford Park estate, the first London garden suburb. The pub was designed by architect Richard Norman Shaw and is Grade II*-listed. The exterior swing sign (with a different image on each side) is a replica of the original which was painted by Thomas Matthews Rooke, who was at one time a studio assistant in Chiswick to Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Inside, particularly on the right, there is colourful Arts and Crafts tiling that covers the upper parts of the wall, which features snakes and blue birds by William De Morgan.\n\r\nIn the left-hand bar on the overmantel look for the pair of two-tile panels depicting nursery rhyme scenes, hand-painted in blue enamel on plain Dutch tin-glazed tiles which have descriptions 'Where are you going my pretty maid\u2019 and 'The maid was in the garden\u2019. Also, above another fireplace is another two-part tiled painting, damaged, with the description 'Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep\u2019. These were most probably designed by Walter Crane and decorated in the Morris & Co. workshops\".\n\r\nThis pub retains two separate bars, although it also possible to move between them by two corridors, one behind the servery, and the other immediately in front of the bar counter. The bar back is from a 1971 refurbishment, but the counter looks original with a replacement top \u2013 note the \u2018cupboards\u2019 in the counter frontage to allow access to the beer engines.\n\r\nThe panelling is mostly modern. The pub has been extended to the left into a neighbouring house to create more drinking spaces. On the first floor is the Tabard Theatre (0208 995 6035), an intimate 79-seat fringe theatre which has been host to the likes of Al Murray, Harry Hill and Russell Brand.",

There is a frieze of bunch of grapes above the partition. It has a wonderful floor to ceiling tiled wall with patterned relief tiled in mainly green and yellow on the dado and above seven tiled panels in light green, turquoise etc. A door with \u2018Saloon bar\u2019 etched and frosted window leads to the rear bar with a Edwardian bar counter where panels have been added to the front between the pilasters but the top looks original. The bar back is mainly Edwardian with pillars but the rear panelling and shelving is modern. The walls have excellent linenfold panelling but a photo on the wall shows much plainer panels so presumable it was added at a later date?\n\nIf you take a careful look at the floral patterned etched rear window you can see the outline of a Prussian helmet. The pub changed its name from the King of Prussia to the King Edward VII in 1913. The fireplace might be old but more likely a reproduction one. Steps lead up to a room on the rear left which is an addition with no old fittings. The front bar with \u2018Lounge bar\u2019 etched and frosted panel in the door has a modern counter and bar back, post-war panelled walls and modern flag floor on the right and bare wood on the left. The existence of more front doors confirms it was at least two rooms in the past. Some dado panelling on the rear left is old as could be the small tiled and vast iron fireplace. All the stubby partitions are modern.",

        "Address": "88 Tooley Street, London, London Bridge, SE1 2TF",
        "Description": "Three-storey pub of brick built in 1884 with a ground-floor wooden exterior of late C19 or early C20. Note on the exterior a number of stone carvings picked out in cream on a deep blue background and in particular the crouching Caryatid with outstretched arms above the right hand corner doors.\r\n\r\nThe left hand doors originally led to a vestibule entrance lobby and on the left hand wall is a splendid painted tiled panel of around 1900 showing shipwrights (arms and all) at work beside a choppy River Thames. A steam tug tows barges down the river. The painting is signed by Charles Evans & Co., a west London firm of tile and stained glass manufacturers. \r\n\r\nThe interior consists of a central island bar, originally this would have been surrounded by at least three separate compartments (the multiple outside doors would each have given access to a separate drinking space.) but the partitions having been removed many years ago. Markings on the floor on the right show where one partition was situated; also, there is a change in the bar top on the rear left indicating where another one might have been situated. \r\n\r\nThe counter front looks inter-war with the rear section being a fielded panelled style whereas that on the front is upright panels but is also of a canted style. The island gantry-style back fitting is wholly modern. In a disused passage, now part of the route to the gents (now downstairs) has a colourful tiled dado and a tall door with inter-war frosted glass in a floor to ceiling screen.",

Nowell Parr who was responsible for the splendid Forester, West Ealing, London W13, built in 1909, and other pubs for the brewery. Originally it had four bars and an off-sales but sadly the partitions that created the separate rooms have long gone \u2013 part survives in the servery area on the right. A lot of the original fittings survive \u2013 the panelled counter which has been painted cream; a bar-back fitting facing two sides with mirrored panels (but only a small section of the lower shelves remain, the rest lost to fridges); and fixed seating along the exterior walls. In the rear area is a tiled and wood-surround fireplace from 1909, minimalist panelling of upright strips and wooden cornice at two-thirds height. The brick and wood-surround fireplace at the front are modern as is the curly metal pot shelf. Lots of lovely, colourful leaded lights in the upper parts of the windows. The pub is near to the Hanwell flight of locks on the Grand Union Canal.",

There are two vestibule entrances with some original etched and frosted glazed panels. To the sides of both entrances are areas of multi-coloured tiled floors. Originally the interior would have been divided into a number of bars separated by partitions but none of these survive so it is now a single room in a narrow V-shape with a curved end. In the centre is an island servery reflecting the shape of the pub; the counter is original with sloping front but has been painted grey and has a modern copper top all along it. In the middle is an exceptionally narrow carved mirrored bar gantry / bar-back fitting: this nearly reaches the ceiling and has a broken pediment, clock on the top, and lamp holders. \r\n\r\nThe star here is the striking geometric and floral, colourful patterned enamel-sectioned ceiling surrounded by a strip of mahogany and with ceiling bosses throughout \u2013 a similar example can be seen at the Cambridge, Leicester Square. There are no divisions on this to indicate the former room layout. There are two marble fireplaces which look to be original but one has a modern hearth. Formerly G.E. Aldwinkle\u2019s, its literary customers included George Orwell, who worked at a bookshop opposite, and Joe Orton.",

A fireplace on the far left has been covered by fielded panelling (possibly re-used from missing partitions?). \n\nOn the right is a large old fireplace with bread oven, old black pot and old panelling around it which could have come from the original pub. The pub is famous for \u2018The Ancient Ceremony of Swearing on the Horns\u2019 \u2013 full details in a framed panel over the fireplace with the horns above it. \n\nOne of pub's exterior windows at the rear is glazed with 'Established 1547' and 'Rebuilt 1921' and another with 'Olde Wres era'. Panelled walls run all around the rear part of the pub but most are of a different style to the front panels and are believed to be from the 1950s - a former fireplace is now covered up by panelling.

The ground floor is now a single space but its original tripartite structure can easily be traced. Indeed the names of two of the rooms are still visible in bright stained glass above doors on the Pratt Street elevation \u2013 Saloon Bar and Private Bar. The latter seems to have been turned into an off-sales judging by the inscription on the door glass possibly in around 1936 (i.e. just after Charrington & Co. bought Hoare's). Part of the screen, with etched glass, separating the private bar/off-sales from what must have been the public bar is still in place, straddling the servery.  \r\n\r\nThe star feature, though, is the Victorian bar back with a scrolly pediment, bevelled mirrors, a dumb waiter, and lots of good detail including two doors with etched glass panes. There is also a panelled bar counter and a chunky Devon marble fireplace. The public bar seems to have been refitted, probably in the 1950s or 1960s, whence the bar back with its Charrington lettering and ply-panelled bar counter. The upstairs club (formerly billiard) room has another Devon marble fireplace and the nearby gents\u2019 are intact with colourful dado tiling and two urinals.",

        "Description": "Early to mid 19th century two-storey building with a wooden frontage on the ground floor and stucco-faced on the first floor. This is one of Marylebone\u2019s two remaining mews pubs and situated near Harley Street. The pub was referenced by Maurice Gorham in his famous 1949 book Back To The Local, as the mews pub \"par excellence\". It survived a nearby wartime bomb, and for many years was a local favourite under its redoubtable landlady Mrs. Mooney, not least because it opened on Bank Holidays when other pubs around did not. The phrase \"Meet you at Mooney's\" was in current use for a long period. \r\n\r\nThere are two sets of double doors, those on the left with \u2018Bottle\u2019 and \u2018Entrance\u2019 inscribed in the etched glass, and hence leading at one time into an off-sales compartment (a display case still remains on the left-hand wall); the others proclaim \u2018Retail\u2019 and \u2018Entrance\u2019, which must have referred to the main drinking areas so a partition has been lost. The sloping bar counter appears to be Victorian counter, but the bar back is modern work. Note the mirrors underneath the dividing beam which allowed coachmen to observe when their passengers were ready to depart. \r\n\r\nThere are three other rooms \u2013 that on the front right is entered through wide opening and has an old baffle. The dado panelling looks modern. At the rear right is a lovely small room entered through a sliding door; the doorway has been widened somewhat and there is a no. 1 above it.  The division between the front and back rooms is a thin timber partition with a curious grill high up at the far end (a similar one is placed near the main pub entrance in the timber screen there: what was their purpose?). \r\n\r\nFollowing the change of operator from Samuel Smiths to the owners of the Euston Tap \u2013 who changed the name from Dover Castle to Jackalope \u2013 there have been changes in the rear left area. It looks like part of the bar counter has been removed \u2013 there is a stranded piece and counter flap on the right. This has created access to the basement where the toilets are situated, and a new dining room has been created. Also, the former ladies\u2019 toilet at the rear left has been converted to a new small room.",

Nowadays all the internal divisions have gone and one can circumnavigate the very impressive servery with its mahogany fittings. Much of the timber and etched and cut glass screenwork  between the front and back parts of the pub is still in situ. The rear of the servery has a pleasing curved shaped counter. The ceiling is richly treated with Lincrusta panels. A notable and unusual feature is the raised snug at the rear with its iron rails and skylight. The Liberty Dining Room upstairs has a good fireplace (but modern bar fittings). ). The pub was once owned by the family-run Liberty department store which had plans to use it as a storehouse but then sold it off in 1993. Clachan is a Scottish word for hamlet but it is unknown what the connection was.",

It underwent a facelift about 1930 when the external timbering was exposed and mostly replaced. At this time the interior was much modified and to this scheme belongs the bar counter with its sloping, vertical boarding (the bar-back fittings may be contemporary but are of fairly indeterminate date). The 1930 arrangements consisted of two separate bars at slightly different levels, divided by a screen, part of which survives: the opening of the screen took place in 1971. On the left was the saloon bar which is graced by an impressive amount of wall-panelling, dating back probably to the 17th or 18th century. This space also has a imposing brick fireplace of c.1930. The public bar was rather more simply appointed but it also has a less grand c.1930 brick fireplace. The atmosphere of this venerable pub, although common enough in small towns and country areas, is rare for Greater London. A notable external feature is the 'gallows' inn-sign arrangement.",

This new lounge was created on the right-hand side of the building, in what was previously private accommodation. The bar counter is gently curved and has a front of pink Formica panels divided by black strips; a pink Formica counter top which extends onto the main shelf of the bar back, the pink being faded from the original bright red \u2013 the original colour can be seen on the underside of the hatch for staff. The bar-back has a backing of mirror glass mosaic of a style popular in the 1960s to which shelves are attached. Look for the c.1959 till drawer on the bar back. The whole room has fielded panelling to just above half-height and an inter-war brick fireplace with a wooden mantle and there is some bay window seating of similar age. Both the gents' and ladies' have not changed since c.1959 with a dado of inter-war-style tiling of cream with one narrow strip of purple. All the doors are from the inter-war period. \r\n\r\nOn the left, prior to 1959, the public area occupied the floor plan of the present public bar, and consisted of a tiny public bar (left) and an equally small lounge bar. Where the division between the two lay is easy to envisage. The present public bar seems to have been re-floored with herringbone blocks while the counter front, counter top and the bar-back were both given Formica finishes in a light fawn colour and there are two bar-back fittings that have a backing of mirror glass mosaic. and the main shelf is of a light fawn colour. Look for the c.1959 till drawer on the bar back. The fireplace looks to be of inter-war brick, but dado panelling is difficult to date. Part of the old public bar is now the toilets \u2013 note how the servery extends further to the left than the bar counter. The gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets on the public bar side retain their c.1959 tiling but this is due to be replaced in 2015 due to damaged tiles. The figures \u20181\u2019 and \u20182\u2019 can be found on the doors to the public bar and lounge bar respectively.",

        "Pub Name": "Queen's Head",
        "Address": "123 High Street, Cranford, TW5 9PB",
        "Description": "The Queens Head was rebuilt by Fullers about 1931 in a loosely Neo-Tudor style with red brick and some half-timbering. This was a high-quality job and the interior is very little altered, making it one of the best survivors of its time. It consists of three main parts with the public bar on the left, separated from the saloon on the right by the servery. Then, at the rear on the right, is a third room with a tall open timber roof and which aims to give a sense of an old baronial hall. The only significant change to the public spaces has been the creation of a connection between the public bar and saloon at the front of the pub. \r\n\r\nThe public bar has half-height fielded panelling, exposed timbering and brickwork above, and a fireplace of exposed brickwork. The gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 lavatories either side of the fireplace have their original entrance doors, with vertical grooving, and what may well be original copper-plate signage. All toilets were updated with modern sanitaryware in the 2015 refit.  \r\n\r\nThe saloon is of a comparable size and style, although the fireplace is somewhat grander and is set within an inglenook, with narrow fixed benches to either side. The counter is larger than that in the public bar: as with the latter, the glass shelf or gantry is a modern insertion, in this case set on coupled square piers. The gents' lavatories have their original door, with vertical grooving. \r\n\r\nOff the saloon is a small passage \u2013 lined with fielded panelling, but an open window Kitchen is now accessed from this point \u2013 leading to a large room which is the principal component of the pub\u2019s south wing. This rises up to the wing\u2019s pitched roof, and has an exposed timber ceiling of Tudor inspiration. It is named the saloon lounge on the plans of 1977. It has an original fireplace with a curved brick hearth, the half-height fielded panelling is largely original. At the rear of the saloon lounge is a small area, originally a store, which was brought into pub use in c.1977, which is the date of panelling and false timber joists. Lots of original oak doors. \r\n\r\nThe original Queens Head dates back to 1604 and purports to be the first pub in England to be granted a spirits licence (a piece of imaginative thinking, one suspects!).",

        "Description": "A really remarkable survivor. This is a purpose-built pub for a Greater London Council housing estate, dating from about 1974. It is virtually exactly as built apart from minor changes like the addition of the bank of fridges in the servery and gaming machines. There is a single drinking space which has a series of seating compartments with upholstered  benches \u2013 a small section of seating looks to have been removed from the area with the pool table. The servery has a dark brick counter which is divided into three by square, full-height brick piers and a deep wooden top. There is a darts area created by a part glazed partition.The style of decoration, such as the horizontal slats to the seating and some parts of the walls and the orange tiling in the gents', is quintessential 1970s work. The pub seems to have a long-term threat from a full regeneration of the estate. Opens at 3 Mon to Thu.",

        "Description": "Built 1936-7 \u2013 architect A.E. Sewell for Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co. Ltd. Now mostly an open plan pub interior which may have been as many as five rooms originally, there is however two rooms with quality original fittings remaining but one is in use as a function room and the other currently used for storage and access to them is not easy to arrange. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a report by English Heritage \r\n\r\nThe north-west side of the former saloon has been altered: it contained a large opening in 1995, and this has now been infilled with folding doors and partitioning above. Originally, this area probably contained the saloon\u2019s counter, opening from the pub\u2019s central servery. Aside from this alteration, however, the saloon \u2013 now used only at certain times of the week and for special events \u2013 survives remarkably intact: indeed, it is probably the best surviving and most impressive room at the Green Man. Its original status is reflected in the quality of the work. The room retains its three-quarter-height fielded panelling and a handsome timber chimneypiece on the south-west side, with pilasters framing the fireplace and the overmantel. There is some decorative plasterwork on the ceiling beams, and the canted bay window on the south-east is set with stained glass coats of arms. The bench seating on the sides of the room may well be original. \r\n\r\nWork of an even higher quality survives in the adjacent room to the south-west, set in a single-storey block. This was probably accessible from within the saloon, but the main route of access was via the dedicated entrance at the left side of the Green Man, adjacent to the gates and off licence. The original function of this large room is not known, but it was probably a dining room or saloon lounge, both of which were typical features of improved pubs in the inter-war period, especially those of a substantial size. The room \u2013 now no longer in general use \u2013 retains decorative plasterwork to its ceiling and has square plaster panels on the upper parts of its walls, featuring emblems such as roses, a portcullis and a lion. On the room\u2019s north-east side is an unusually large and fine timber chimneypiece, with pilasters to either side and an upper architrave supported on curved brackets. The room also has three-quarter height fielded panelling, and a skylight with its original stained-glass work. There have probably always been ladies\u2019 lavatories where they are now situated, at the south-west corner of the room. The original arrangement at the room\u2019s inner (north-west) end is less clear, on account of a high degree of alteration, though the area probably contained a serving hatch rather than a counter.",

It was built to serve the Springfield Estate (built by London County Council between 1935 and 1955 which was developed to the plans of architects Louis de Soissons and George Grey Wornum). The brewery sold off the pub in 1993 and it retains a little altered interior of three small rooms.\n\r\nThe front left main bar retains the original curved bar counter with the front painted black, original four-bay bar back with the right-hand bay being just a bevelled mirror panel. The only change is the insertion of a cold shelf possibly in the 1960/70s, which is a rare survivor and means no lower shelving has been lost to fridges. This small room has an original wood surround fireplace painted black with a modern hearth, original dado panelling painted a grey-blue, but the fixed seating is modern.\n\r\nA doorway leads to the rear small bar which retains the original small bar counter with the front painted black, original wood surround fireplace (now blocked-up) painted grey-blue as is the original dado panelling. Look into the servery and you will see a hoist to move bottles from the cellar and return them for what we now call recycling. The gents\u2019 off this room and the ladies off the right-hand passage are intact but the inter-war tiling has been painted light blue. There is a sliding door between the rear bar and the right-hand passage which leads to the third bar.\n\r\nAccessible from the right-hand front doors is another small bar which retains the original curved counter with the front painted black, original four-bay mirrored bar-back fitting \u2013 again, the only change is the insertion of a cold shelf possibly in the 1960/70s. The room retains an original small wood surround fireplace (blocked-up) painted black, dado panelling painted a grey-blue and an original corner upholstered bench.",

        "Description": "The original Sultan was destroyed by bombs in February 1944. The present pub was built of brick in the 1950s and is a remarkably intact survivor of the early post-war period. Originally an Allied Breweries pub, it was rescued from likely permanent closure in 1994 by Hop Back Brewery. All the indications are that it was always just two rooms \u2013 public bar on the left (not always open \u2013 but accessible via the gents\u2019) and the saloon bar on the right \u2013 look for the wording in the disused door on Norman Road (left) side and the rear right door (however, confusingly, there is a \u2018Public Bar\u2019 wording above the right hand front door on Deburgh Road \u2013 but not one above the left-hand door so maybe a recent move, which is quite likely as the right-hand saloon bar now acts as the main bar).  \r\n\r\nThe public bar on the left retains its original counter of a distinctive 1950s style with the front now painted a deep pink, original bar back of shelves on ply panelling with some mirrored panels, but fridges have replaced the lower shelves. Around the small room is a dado of 1950s ribbed hardboard now painted a deep pink and there are two small 1950s brick fireplaces. At the rear left an internal door leads to a lobby now used for storage and the exterior door here is labeled \u2018Public Bar\u2019.  \r\n\r\nThe saloon bar on the right retains the original counter of a distinctive 1950s style with the front now painted a deep pink, original bar back of shelves on ply panelling with some mirrored panels where two small fridges have replaced some, but not all, of the lower shelves. Within the back fittings there is a dumb waiter that would have been used for moving bottled beers to and from the cellar. Above the servery is a very characteristic c.1960 canopy of pegboard tiles with a 1950s ribbed hardboard edging now painted a deep pink. There are three small 1950s brick fireplaces and around the room are two types of panelling \u2013 tall ply panels reaching to picture-frame height either side of the servery and around the rear right fireplace; elsewhere, a dado of 1950s ribbed hardboard now painted a deep pink. On the rear right is an exterior door with the wording \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 and the figure \u20181\u2019 on the back of the door.  \r\n\r\nThe gents\u2019 is accessible from both the public and saloon bars and retains its original wall tiles, floor tiles and urinals and the ladies\u2019 is also similarly intact. A conservatory has been added onto the right-hand side of the building in recent years.",

        "Description": "A large Victorian building of brick (red at the front and brown at the rear) and stone with claret tiling on the Bickley Street ground floor side. Originally the Foresters Arms, in the inter-war period it was subject to a quality refurbishment carried out by Barclays Perkins & Co. Ltd. Anchor Brewery of Southwark. It was rescued from an uncertain future in 2009 by Antic, who renamed the pub and carried out changes to aid the food trade including creating an open kitchen. However, much remains of the inter-war refit in what is now three large rooms.  \n\nBeyond the frontage with its curved windows is the main bar which would have originally been at least three rooms. It retains a U-shaped canted bar counter with two types of panelling on the front all painted a dull shade of green. There is an ornate island bar back with shelving and the top held up by lovely carved pillars and also a mirrored back fitting with a \u2018Barclays Beers\u2019 with Samuel Johnson trade mark illuminated panel at the top of the left of four bays; there has been some modernisation to the bar back. There is an excellent rare full height glazed screen at the rear of the right hand side of the room where the higher panels are original but there are a lot of transfers on the lower ones. On the left hand wall above the dado is inter-war panelling which has been painted a gastro grey-green colour and opposite the open kitchen there is an inter-war tiled and wood surround fireplace. There is a door on Bickley Street side that may have been the off sales. \n\nAt the rear of the left hand side of the room are double doors in a glazed partition that almost reaches the ceiling (note the figure \u20187\u2019 over the door) leading into what is now a dining room with a very high ceiling. This is virtually unchanged since the inter-war period with fielded panelling to just above half height thankfully not painted, the inter-war curved bar counter (note the cupboards), a bar back fitting consisting of a three mirrored bays and on the return another two bays separated by a doorway to the kitchen for staff. Most of the lower bar back shelves have been replaced by fridges. There is an unusual vestibule-like area near the exterior door on the right hand side and an inter-war tiled and wood surround fireplace.  \n\nThere is a flight of four steps on the left hand side of the room which leads to another large high-ceilinged room with signs of a skylight so this may have been a billiard room? It has a parquet floor and inter-war fielded panelling to just over half height on most, but not all the walls. Just inside the room on the right created by stud walls is the ladies toilet added in recent years. The curved rear window has stained and leaded panes, the cast-iron fireplace is an addition / replacement and there are two good high-backed settles which are rarely seen in city pubs! \n\nThis pub was where the meeting to create the Tooting & Mitcham United Football club was held in 1932. In 1993 the pub was the venue for the first promotion by the newly formed British Ladies\u2019 Boxing Association and featured 10 women fighting six two-minute rounds in front of a crowd of 70 or so. There was a boxing gym above the pub in those days.",

        "Pub Name": "Festival Inn",
        "Address": "71 Grundy Street, Poplar, E14 6AD",
        "Description": "This is an extremely rare example of an intact post-war pub. It dates from 1950-1, that is before new pub-building really got going again after the Second World War.  It takes its name from the Festival of Britain held in 1951 as a British pick-me-up in an austerity-ridden country. It still has its separate public and saloon bars and even the off-sales remains intact (but disused). It is situated at the rear entrance to the Chrisp Street Market, the first purpose-built UK pedestrian shopping area which features a prominent clock tower, shops, small retail outlets, cafes, 80 market stalls and apartments. It was designed by Frederick Gibberd, architcet of the RC cathedral in Liverpool and Harlow New Town. The interiors were fitted out by architcet R.W. Stoddart. The development forms part of the Lansbury Estate which in 1948 was chosen as the site of the \u2018Live Architecture\u2019 Exhibition of the 1951 Festival of Britain. In 1997 Chrisp Street Market was made a Conservation Area \u2013 see http://moderngov.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=7768 which, sadly, does not mention the Festival Inn. \r\n\r\nIt is a three-storey building of yellow stock brick with a flat-roofed single-storey section on the Grundy Street side faced with tiles (now painted cream), the rear section of the building being part of the shops. The pub was built for Trumans (Black Eagle) Brewery and on both the south and north faces are (white painted) plaster roundels of Trumans' eagle. The front inn sign has a festival scene on the south face and the symbol of the Festival of Britain on the north. By the public bar entrance is a faded simple \u2018The Festival Inn Trumans Ales\u2019 inn sign. The exterior windows appear to be original Crittall ones.  \r\n\r\nThe saloon bar, situated on the Grundy Street side with half of it in the flat-roofed part of the building, has a wooden floor. The plan as published in 'The Builder' for August 1951 and shows a tiny partition that linked the bar counter to the fireplace; otherwise it is intact. The bar counter has a front of three sections \u2013 on the left and right it is made of wood with grid pattern parquetry and along the top part is a brass panel \u2013 the central section is of 1950s style vertical panels. The bar top has a protruding section in the middle which houses a lift used to transport crates from the cellar  and to return empties (no longer in use). The back fitting is mirrored with glass shelves. There is a dumb waiter to the first floor. Look for the attractive door to the left of the counter giving access for the bar staff and to the private quarters - it is very much of its time with its large glass panel surrounded by narrow panels in a geometric design.  \r\n\r\nOn the walls are various types of panelling to two-thirds height on both sides of the servery. There is an alcove on the right with a large radiator. Note also the fixed seating (recently reupholstered) with triangular wooden and brass divisions topped by large cylindrical pillars. There are two entrances to the saloon \u2013 a corner one on the right and on the left a vestibule with glazed partition on the bar side with the ladies\u2019 toilet leading off to the rear. There is a chimney piece rising from the centre of the saloon bar (but no fireplace now). Toilets modernised. \r\n\r\nThere is a separate entrance to the public bar. This has a linoleum floor, another bar counter of wood with parquetry in a grid pattern and along the top part is a brass panel: mirrored bar-back fitting with glass shelves. There is an office shown in plan displayed on the right-hand side of the servery. There is much wood panelling  Above the fireplace is a mirror with the 1951 Festival of Britain symbol. Toilets modernised. \r\n\r\nThere is a (disused) door to the left of that to the public bar one to the former off-sales. It retains its counter, back fitting, glazed display case and has the figure \u20183\u2019 above the inside of the front door. At quiet times it is possible for staff to show you the off-sales from within the servery.",

The bar counter front has fielded panelling that appears to be inter-war and the counter top is old but is strangely sitting on a stone plinth that does not look to be of any age. The bar back could be Victorian with bevelled mirrors and columns with capitals and a decorative frieze at the top. The dado panelling might be old and the bay window has 1930s stained and leaded windows.  \n\nThe main bar on the right has a curving bar counter of fielded panelling on a plinth that does not look old and here the counter top is modern. The bar back fitting looks 1970s and the separate small area on the right on a lower level has no old fittings. What is rare here it that you are allowed to walk through the servery to get from one bar to another. If you can, take a look at the West Ham Boys Boxing Club gym at the rear of the building - Training Times: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 5-6pm; Contact Lianne Jameson on 020 8472 3614.

The public bar on the right has a lino floor, a bar counter with fine diagonal panels and inlaid Formica on the top, typical of its time. The bar back appears to be original with illuminated panels over it but sadly 'fridges have replaced most of the lower shelves.  The fixed seating retains baffles at both ends and another by a small missing section in the middle \u2013 was there a fireplace here originally? Probably not as large radiators heat the room. \r\n\r\nThere is door on the rear right marked \u2018Fire Exit\u2019 but was this the original reason? Gents is unaltered. The lounge on the left has carpet and retains the original counter with padded panels, an original bar back fitting where two 'fridges replace some lower shelves. Above the original fixed seating is vertical fielded panelling and the two large radiators look very 1950s style. \r\n\r\nThere is an area to the right / public bar side which looks like it should be a separate room but the panels on the walls seem to indicate it was built as an area \u2013 there is no sign of a door into this space with fixed seating around a bay window. The only change appears to be the adding of double doors on the front left side to access the smoking area that meant a small section of fixed seating has been lost. A very 1960s feature is the bottles in the wall of both exterior porches \u2013 the ones on the left have been painted over.",

        "Description": "Originally the \u2018Shippe Inn\u2019 and dating back to 1780, it was rebuilt as the Spread Eagle and Crown in the 19th century. War damage to the roof and top floor led to a major refurbishment in 1957 which created a 16th century style interior and this riverside pub was renamed the Mayflower after the ship which left from the nearby landing steps for America carrying the Pilgrim Fathers. Much of the 1957 work remains in the main bar and front snug; there is also a dining room upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe snug at the front has a bare wood floor, old high backed settle-style fixed seating line the walls and it retains (disused) its exterior door on the front right hand side. The bar counter is of lapped wood panels painted black and assumed to be the 1957 one.\r\n\r\nThe main bar is on two levels and also with a bare wood floor and seating bays that date to 1957. The bar counter is of the same style as that in the snug and is curved on the left hand side; however, the bar back and bar top look modern. There is a large brick fireplace which looks like it too could date from 1957. At the rear a wooden deck has been built on stilts which offers splendid views of the River Thames.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor is a dining room on two levels with bare wood floors and windows overlooking the R. Thames. There are a couple of high backed settles, piece of carved panelling at the top of the stairs but no other old fittings.\r\n\r\nThe Mayflower claims to be the only place licensed to sell American stamps in the UK \u2013 look for the tiny grate, a postal hatch, on the left of the bar near the ladies toilet door.",

Some of the partitions survived up to about 1990 but now there are only ornate short screens either side of the right hand door. The Victorian bar counter survives with a noticeable change in its detailed front on the left hand side, but has been painted a mushroom colour in recent years (top not painted). There is an island bar back where the lower shelves look old and also an ornate bar back with ornate mirrored sections including some of a rose (check \u2013 possibly back painted).  \n\nAt the rear left is an ornate Victorian mahogany fireplace with a carved hood and in the mantelpiece lozenge-shaped mirror with (back-painted) flowers and leaves. One pillar has an ornate capital. There is a massive \u2018Hoare & Co\u2019s Celebrated Stout\u2019 gilded mirror on the right hand wall \u2013 Hoare & Co brewed at Lower East Smithfield, just near St Katherine's Dock and were taken over by Charrington who then went on to use the Toby Jug symbol that was originally Hoare\u2019s.",

        "Pub Name": "Park Tavern",
        "Address": "212 Merton Road, Wandsworth, Southfields, SW18 5SW",
        "Description": "Consisting of a three-storey pub on the right of 1902 and a single-story extension on the right from 1926, it was refitted by T H Nowell Parr for Royal Brewery of Brentford. Remarkably, the 1926 interior of quality fittings is very little changed in three rooms (was originally four and an off sales).\n\r\nOn the Merton Road side an entrance in the three-storey part of the pub has Bostwick gates pulled to the side with \u2018Park Tavern\u2019 in the ironwork above. The vestibule, which is curved internally on both sides, has a well worn \u2018Public & Jugs Bar\u2019 mosaic floor. There are doors to the left and right (both disused) and one in the centre so it looks like there was an off sales leading from the centre door and originally rooms to the left and right but this is now one large space. On the front right is an area with fielded panelling to picture frame height on the walls, a fireplace with an old wood surround but modern brick interior but the fixed seating is modern. The bar counter is of fielded panelling sloping to the top but is sadly painted white. The front left area has a floor of part modern tiles and part carpet, more fielded panelling to picture frame height on the walls and also another curved entrance with a (disused) central door.\n\r\nA substantial doorway / short passage with fielded panelling to picture frame height leads to the main bar with a bare wood floor and fielded panelling on the walls to picture frame height. There is another entrance vestibule with a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 mosaic floor and a door with a brass \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 sign. The bar counter has a front of fielded panelling but is sadly painted white and the counter top could be from 1926. Then bar back fitting lower shelves might be old but the top section is modern; half of lower shelving lost to fridges.\n\r\nThere is a large room in the single-storey part of the building which has a wide opening from the saloon bar but the existence of a beam held up by a pair of bulbous balusters perched on the top of square columns to the left and right indicates it was built like this \u2013 wide openings to rooms is a feature of pubs designed by Nowell Parr e.g. Forester, West Ealing, London W13 . This bare boarded room has walls covered in fielded panelling to picture frame height with strapwork decoration all along the top section \u2013 look for the folding ventilators in the panelling on the Merton Road side. Most of the rear side of the room is taken up by a large inter-war inglenook fireplace with baffles either side and on top of them are two bulbous balusters holding up the ceiling here. A Tudor-shaped arch stone fireplace has a mantelpiece featuring another four bulbous balusters.\n\nUpdate January 2020\n\r\nThe historic wooden fittings - bar backs, bar counters, and the extensive wall panelling in the whole of the right hand part of the pub has been painted a vivid blue colour - so our photos are out of date. Fortunately, the panelling and the inglenook fireplace in left hand room still retains its original wood stain.",

        "Address": "92-94 Linkfield Road, Isleworth, TW7 6QJ",
        "Description": "Believed to have been built by T H Nowell Parr (it has many features seen in his other pubs for Fullers & Royal Brewery) in the early 1900s it retains many original fittings in three rooms. The exterior features arcading of six bays with a dado of dark green / brown glazed brick with green tiles (possibly Royal Doulton which were the choice of Nowell Parr) above, some in relief. There are two disused doors \u2013 one on the right was the off sales and the other presumably a private entrance. On the right twin doors with \u2018Bottles\u2019 and\u2018 Jugs\u2019 (assumed to have been moved) lead to the public bar \u2013 a disused door into this room has \u2018The Red Lion\u2019 in the top light. Beyond the stud wall on the left is now a kitchen but there was an off-sales in this area originally.\n\r\nThe public bar has a bar counter that looks to be from the inter-war period with its inlaid red top whereas the bar back is much older consisting of two bays with leaded mirrored panels. Behind the servery is a publican\u2019s office still in use, with a sliding door having an Edwardian etched panel in it. The fireplace has an inter-war wood surround but the interior tiles are modern; good loose benches (dated?) and old dado panelling. At the rear of the room is a pool table \u2013 it is not obvious if there were two rooms originally. Lots of colourful leaded lights in the exterior windows.\n\r\nLeft hand twin front doors with \u2018Saloon & Billiards\u2019 on the left one and \u2018Public Bar\u2019 on the right one (moved?) lead to the saloon bar with walls of fielded panelling, a bar counter that looks old but might have been moved back (?), and a two-bay bar back with leaded glass mirrored panels but fridges have replaced lower shelving. The fireplace is tiled with a Tudor-arch shaped hearth but not in use and a door at the rear left has a leaded panel in it (behind it is the cleaners cupboard now). The rear wall of the room has part cut out to improve supervision of the rear room.\n\r\nA doorway from the saloon bar leads to the two-part rear room \u2013 on the left is a stage area where the wide opening looks to have always been so (again, something seen in Nowell Parr pubs). Bay window at rear has three colourful leaded windows. The right hand part is believed to have been the billiards room and has panelling on the walls to two-thirds height and a lino floor now covered by carpet. There are two bar counter openings \u2013 left section is curved and behind it is an old mirrored bar back fitting. Toilets at the rear were added in the inter-war years \u2013 they are modernised but do have Crittal windows. Still retains the original stables at the rear which have been used for beer festivals.",

        "Pub Name": "Cheshire Cheese",
        "Address": "5 Little Essex Street, London, Temple, WC2R 3LD",
        "Description": "Built of brick in neo-Georgian style in 1928 by architect T H Nowell Parr for the Style & Winch Brewery with an attractive series of curved windows. The compact building consists of six floors - cellar; lower ground-floor lounge bar; ground floor-bar and gents'; first-floor dining room and ladies'; living accommodation and office on the second floor; and the kitchen and further bedrooms on the third floor - all connected by a dumb waiter. Its public layout over three floors is little altered with quality fittings. It is clear from the original plans that serving food dates back to the pub\u2019s opening. \r\n\r\nOn the ground floor is the main bar which was originally two small rooms - a public bar on the right and saloon bar on the left. If you look on the counter front you will see there are actually two bar counters slightly off-set showing where the partition that originally separated the rooms was situated. The inner left-hand door still retains a \u2018Saloon\u2019 brass plate. The room has fielded panelling to three-quarter height (some to full height) and a panelled bar counter with plain pilasters. There are two bar-backs of three bays each made of carved oak, inset with leaded mirror panels, supported by pilasters with detailed carved decoration, including barley twists. Fridges have replaced the left-hand lower shelving but that on the right remains. There is a Tudor arch-headed doorway between the two sections. The pot-shelf above the bar counter is modern. \r\n\r\nOn the right near the bar counter is an elaborate fielded panelled cover with door behind which is a cask lift. As the cellar is two storeys below ground casks of beer are not \u2018dropped\u2019 but are lowered mechanically \u2013 we are not aware of another similar cask lift in a pub. \r\n\r\nA staircase leads from the ground floor near the left hand door to the lower ground floor \u2013 above you as you descend there is a figure \u20183. Originally the lounge bar, it retains the original counter but it has been shortened on the left side by three to four feet. The bar-back is of a similar design to that in the main bar with six visible bays and a shorter one on the right and runs the width of the room although part on the left-hand side is obscured by a dart board case. The bays have leaded mirror panels and there are three pediments. Lower shelving has been lost by insertion of fridges and new cupboards. The walls have fielded panelling to two-thirds height. \r\n\r\nA staircase ahead of the saloon bar front door has a fielded panelled dado and moulded stair-rail. The small dining room on the first floor retains the original timber fireplace surround and all walls are fronted with fielded panelling to two-thirds height. The bar fittings are modern additions. \r\n\r\nThe gents\u2019 on the ground floor retains two original urinals but the toilet area was increased in size in 1976, as was the ladies' toilet upstairs.",

It still retains its layout of three rooms and off sales but the left hand bar and rear bar are amalgamated and there is an extension at the back. \r\n\r\nThe amount of original fittings is best seen in the small \u2018Sports Bar\u2019 (originally the public bar) on the right. It has a bare wooden floor, the bar counter has a marble (?) trough around the base implying the counter is in its original position but the panels on the counter front look more 1970/80s so appear to have been added onto the original. The bar back fittings does look like it could date from the 1950s with mirrors in the top part and only a small fridge has replaced some lower shelving leaving two-thirds intact. Around the servery is panelling of a distinctive 1950s style now painted black. The wall radiators and dado panelling look 1950s and have been painted a gastro grey-blue colour. \r\n\r\nThe left hand saloon bar has a counter with panelled front that could be from 1950s. There is a good bar back with pilasters and decorative capitals which also look to date from the 1950s but fridges replace the lower shelving. Around the servery is panelling of a distinctive 1950s style now painted black. The room has a good wood surround fireplace with two columns holding up the top with a bevelled mirror in the mantelpiece but modern interior. Dado panelling may be 1950s but is painted a gastro grey-blue colour. Note the 4 snob screens on the bar counter at the front \u2013 but how old are they? At the rear in an extension is a dining room in an extension dated ? \r\n\r\nThe rear bar is now connected to the left hand room is another 1950s looking bar counter front and the bar back fitting is of a similar design to that in the left hand bar. Fridges have replaced half of the lower shelves and there is some modern wood in the upper section.  The off-sales is still there but not in use \u2013 it is situated to the right of the left hand bar. Toilets modernised.",

Bays two and four have semi-circular headed mirror panels with gilded decoration on a wide red edging; bay three has some plain mirrors; and bay one doubles as a entrance for staff with smaller versions of the mirrors in bays two and four. There are five columns with decorative capitals that may be of plaster rather than wood; lower shelving has been lost to fridges.\r\n\r\nThe bar counter also looks to be the original and it too has been painted a \u2018gastro-grey\u2019 colour. Dado wall panelling also looks original but it painted a \u2018gastro pale green\u2019 colour. Two chunky wood fireplaces situated at each end the L-shaped room could date from the 1960s.

        "Description": "Built in 1898 (date on the exterior) by specialist pub architects Shoebridge and Rising. The exterior lobby on the Beaconsfield Road right-hand side of the pub has a mosaic floor and ornamental ironwork containing the name Duke of Sussex across the doorway. On the right-hand wall of this vestibule there is floor to ceiling tiling (but dado tiling and some upper tiles are modern) and in the centre is a panel figure of a girl. The mosaic floor continues into the pub in the form of a narrow passage behind the servery leading to the entrance to the former billiard room, which now serves as a dining room. \r\n\r\nIn the main bar area, there is a central peninsular bar counter with a semi circular end. This might date from the inter-war period, although it might be older with more recent panels attached to the facing. The top of the counter appears modern. A brass rail was reported to encircle the counter some years ago, but this has recently been removed. There is no real bar back. Remnants of partitions which previously sub-divided the U-shaped space around the bar into four small rooms survive (refurbishments took place in 2002 and 2007, when the pub became a gastropub; it is not known whether the partitions were removed during one of these refurbishments or during an earlier revamp). Plaster has been hacked off the walls above the dado exposing bare brickwork. \r\n\r\nThe publican\u2019s office with a number of decorative etched and frosted glass panels (one of which has been replaced by a plain glass panel with a transfer duplicating the etched pattern on the other panes) is still in situ, although it is now used as a wine store. There is a good wooden mantelpiece over the fireplace (now blocked off) in the left-hand side of the room. A front entrance vestibule has etched panels indicating Saloon and Lounge with floral decoration. A door which might have been the entrance to a jug and bottle department to the right of the bar has now been closed off. \r\n\r\nThe former billiard hall/current dining room to the rear is entered through a wide curtain doorway (double doors have evidently been lost) with a carved wooden architrave. It is lit by a spectacular large rectangular skylight, subdivided by cast-iron arched brackets. The skylight has a unique wooden panelled border, carved with brightly painted cherubs and swags. There are other impressive skylights in former billiard rooms at the Boleyn, East Ham E6; and Salisbury, Green Lanes N4 . The room has another good carved fire surround with modern tiles, but a modern servery has been built into the right-hand wall, the walls around which are now faced with modern white tiles and, as in the bar, some plaster has been hacked off the walls elsewhere in the room. There is an attractive doorway into the garden, built into a large, arched French window.",

        "Pub Name": "Crown London Hotel",
        "Address": "142-152 Cricklewood Broadway, Cricklewood, NW2 3ED",
        "Description": "A grand Jacobean-style two-storey public house built in 1899-1900 by the Cannon Brewery of Clerkenwell. The architects were Shoebridge & Rising and most of the design work on the Crown is supposed to have been done by a 43-year-old architect called Henry Whiteman Rising (1857-1936). He had started work as a joiner in Lowestoft and his pub designs were always noted for their excellent woodwork and complex bar fittings. \r\n\r\nIt received a massive refurbishment after being purchased by the Moran Group, an Ireland-based pub and hotel company, in 1998 which saw the rear of the hotel being gutted and also a new 152-room hotel built on land to the right and which opened in 2001. The two are linked by a glass and concrete structure. However, the original public bar at the front and lounge on the right of the original building are little altered since 1900.\r\n\r\nThe lounge is a long, narrow room with two sets of doors on the right and a door to the lobby at the front, so it is likely to have been subdivided in the past by partitions. One set of doors declaring \u2018The Crown Lounge Cricklewood\u2019 and another towards the rear says \u2018Buffet, Dining Room, Billiards\u2019. There are also three carved fireplaces with green glazed brick facings, which could indicate it was three separate rooms in the past. There is a splendid multi-paned bar-back fitting with square pillars with capitals. Just above the main shelf there is a row of ornate deep-cut etched mirrors featuring birds and flowers and on the far left a curved section that might indicate a publican\u2019s office was situated behind here. The bar counter looks to be original and is curved at the right-hand end; parquet floor throughout. Good plasterwork on the ceiling, in a frieze and in the spandrels of the windows; a number of bell-pushes remain.\r\n\r\nSome of the bar fittings in the public bar at the front appear more inter-war than Victorian \u2013 at either end the bar counter front seems original but more recent in the middle where there is a modern marble top. Through three archways on the left there is a smaller servery with another curved counter similar to the front left and right parts. The bar back is of six bays and looks inter-war \u2013 bays two and four are doorways for staff \u2013 fridges have been carefully introduced with wooden edged doors. There are panelled wood surround fireplaces in both front and rear areas on the left. Four sets of doors into the front bar indicate it was originally subdivided.\r\n\r\nThe small lobby between the two bars has a marble floor laid diagonally, an ornate wood surround fireplace with green mottled glazed brick facing, and an open staircase.",

        "Description": "Built 1904 (in stone high up on corner, Grosvenor Road side) for Royal Brewery (Brentford) Ltd. (note the \u2018RBC\u2019 monograms in plaster above the windows on the Oaklands Road side), the architect was almost certainly Thomas H. Nowell Parr. It is of two storeys with brown glazed stone on the ground floor. Originally it had at least four rooms and an off-sales but there are now only two distinctively separate rooms. Corner doors lead to the main L-shaped bar with a bare wood floor and fielded panelling now painted a deep green. The original three-sided bar counter remains with its bulbous front and along the base a row of tiles which are of different colours no doubt indicating the extent of the original rooms, also a black and white mosaic apron all around. The original timber and mirrored bar-back faces in three directions (some lower shelves lost to fridges). The central door on Oaklands Road side looks as though it led to an off-sales but the partitioning has been lost. \r\n\r\nA part-glazed floor-to-ceiling partition with some leaded panels and doorway leads to the snug on the front left. It has a bare wood floor and fielded panelling to two-thirds height still with its original stain. It has the bar counter and bar-back as above and an apparently inter-war brick fireplace, painted black. The short partition/screen with fielded panelling near the toilets in the rear left area looks old. \r\n\r\nTo the rear of the main bar is what is now a dining area following the loss of partitions. Bar staff say there was a bar counter just beyond the main counter and it was removed in 2014 \u2013 if you take a look at the fielded panelling on the partition here and on the back wall it looks newer as it is different to that on the wall to the right and it appears that a bar-back has also been lost. All the fielded panelling in this area has been painted a deep green. The panelling in front of the toilets is also a modern addition. Good Art Nouveau glazing in the upper parts of the windows. \r\n\r\nThere is also an upstairs function room with a beamed mansard ceiling and painted fielded panelling to dado height.",

It is remarkably little altered retaining 5 rooms and was impressively restored by Wetherspoon's (prompted by the Conservation Officer of Ealing Council) prior to re-opening in 2016 after a 6 year closure. \r\n\r\nThe entrance lobby on the south east corner retains a tiled wall. The main bar on the left retains its original bar counter \u2013 the end section was re-instated to its original length in the Wetherspoon;s restoration. The bar back fitting is also original but some lower shelves have been replaced by fridges. The walls have original panelling to two-thirds height but the dado panelling on the wall at the end of the servery is from 2016. There is a stylish mosaic-tiled fireplace with Art Deco wood surround at one end and a tiled and wood surround fireplace at the other end that are both original. A number of original windows advertising \u2018Luncheons & Snacks\u2019, \u2018Wines & Spirits\u2019 survive. A former single WC also survived but now is a \u2018baby changer\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe Lounge bar in the middle, which is slightly opened-up to the main bar, also retains its original curved inter-war bar counter and Art Deco bar back fitting (most of lower shelving to fridges) with plenty of leaded glass windows around the servery. The room is lit by a leaded glass skylight and has more panelling on the walls to two-thirds height. Art Deco cornices survive here and elsewhere. There is another stylish mosaic-tiled fireplace with Art Deco wood surround. \r\n\r\nThe off sales shop remains but has been converted into a snug. Also on the east side of the pub is the Green Room where the original curved bar counter and bar back have been retained but are redundant so the counter acts as a long table for customers with bar stools on both sides of it. Dado panelling looks original. \r\n\r\nThe Assembly Room has been converted into another seating area having been fitted out with seating and tables in open booths but does retain the stage (adorned with a selection of musical instruments that were discovered during the pub\u2019s restoration) and is lit by a clerestory. To serve this area some modern double doors were removed and a small bar counter added in the style of the inter-war ones. Lots of original timber doors with brass handles remain. Some toilets have original fittings.",

It seems to date from the late Victorian years and this is certainly true of the surviving fittings. At that time there would have been at least five internal divisions, as suggested by the numerous external doors. The big delight is a prominent ceramic frieze which is displayed both in the left-hand part of the pub and above part of the servery: it has a cream surround and stylised floral detail.  \n\nThere is a fine six-bay, columned bar-back fitting (with modern modifications) facing on two sides with some semi-circular pediments and alternating balustrade. The bar counter seems original but is now painted a lurid blue. If one looks closely it is evident there were seven opening sections (see the hinges and keyholes): such door are explained by the intention of servicing the beer engines in days past but why they are so numerous here (and absent on the left-hand side) is a bit of mystery.  \n\nNote the mosaic at the corner entrance. It is extended on the left to a what would have been a corridor off which various drinking compartments would have been accessed. If you look closely at the counter on the right-hand side, at the corner is a slot which would have no doubt housed a partition on this side of the pub.",

The present layout of a single space with an island bar was originally three spaces \u2013 small public bar at the front left accessed from the front left hand door; a bar at the rear left accessed from a door down the left hand side of the building; and a U-shaped saloon in the right hand half of the ground floor. There was also a club room on the first floor.  A plan dated 1955 still showed the 3 bars but by 1961 a screen with a door in it situated at the rear was removed leaving a small public bar on the front left and the remaining three-quarters of the ground floor was the enlarged saloon bar. In 1969 the two small partitions that created the public bar were removed and sections of the original partitions with good engraved and faceted glass were reused to form alcoves. The former Saloon Bar entrance on the right has decorative transfer-printed tiles below the dado rail and up to the frieze that look original. There is a good curved screen from this now main entrance including etched and frosted glass panels featuring birds and flowers.\n\nThe island bar counter has fronts of three designs (reflecting the three original rooms) \u2013 that on the rear section with some shell scallop semi-circular sections looks genuinely old; other parts look more inter-war. The island bar gantry is mostly original with mirrored panels and shelves held up by slender pillars. The two squared pillars holding it up to the ceiling look modern and there are two arches for staff \u2013 but what date were they created?  There is an original fireplace in the north-east wall; lots of good mirrors including a Youngers one (the owners in 1961 seem to have been William Younger & Co.) and rare blown glass Victorian gin bottle on the bar back. Note the old bell pushes on the right hand wall \u2013 do these indicate fixed seating lined the wall until 1969 or are they additions from 1969? According to the listed description, upstairs, in the former club room, now a dining room, two late C19 cast-iron fireplaces, and stained and painted glass panels to the upper sashes in the style of the Aesthetic Movement; these windows were introduced in 1969 from a demolished house in Marlborough Crescent, Bedford Park, West London; more such glass on the first-floor landing.",

It appears to have bar fittings from the inter-war and post-war period \u2013 acquired by Courage Brewery in 1950. On the left the bar has a wood block floor, inter-war or post-war panelling to picture-frame height, the fireplace may be old but is painted black and there is a good old Shepherd Neame mirror above. The bar counter looks to be from inter-war times as does some of the bar back. The room has been extended to the rear. \r\n\r\nOn the right the bar counter may also date from inter-war times but the bar back fitting is mostly modern. The dado panelling is inter-war, fireplace is painted black so hard to date. Changes to the floor indicates possible alterations to the counter position / size? In between the two bars is now a fish and chip shop (!) so this small space might have originally been an off-sales?",

Inside there are two bar areas separated by a wall the rear part of which has been converted into a (modern) folding partition and there is an island servery. \r\n\r\nOn the left the bar counter is the original but painted black. This room has two walls panelled to two-thirds height in an Arts & Crafts version of linenfold, with a wood-lined niche all painted dark green containing the fire surround. This is wooden and contains a bevelled mirror on the overmantel flanked by Voyseyesque square colonnettes with moulded caps, and flanked by Tuscan Doric columns. The room is lit by a skylight and there is also a modern food bar on the left. \r\n\r\nThe room on the right has more of the bar counter but the panelling looks more modern and the front is painted black. It has a similar fireplace recess framed by round wooden columns resting on pedestals, with Ionic capitals. Wooden fire surround with tapered pilasters, bevelled mirror set in overmantel above. Marble-faced inset, simple iron grate. Green tiled panels either side of fireplace depicting sunflowers and the walls have fielded panelling to two-thirds height painted dark green. This room is lit by a more modest skylight. Vestibules looks modern.",

        "Pub Name": "Anchor Tap",
        "Address": "20 Horselydown Lane, London, Bermondsey-West, SE1 2LN",
        "Description": "Built early to mid 19th century (source: Historic England \u2013 the pub claims 1761) and refurbished in the late 19th century. It was built as the Tap to the Anchor Brewery, the former Courage Horsleydown brewery, but was sold to Samuel Smiths in the early 1990s. At the front there are two small bars with genuine old fittings, at the rear a room that looks to be in pub use for many years with what looks like a hatch for service. A corridor runs down the left hand side of the servery off which are doorways leading firstly to the games room and the lounge which might well have been brought into public use in modern times. Also, there are rooms upstairs now in public use.\n\nThe double door entrance leads into the public bar which has a terrazzo floor, a late 19th century panelled bar counter with decorative brackets but the mirrored bar back fitting is (mostly) modern \u2013 the top section is described in the listed description as having a \u2018moulded cornice, pilasters and mirrors\u2019. To the right is a late 19th century fireplace with red tiled surround. There is a dado of old matchboard panelling and the chimney breast projects into the side bar. There is a passage to the rear room with two rooms off to the left that have seen changes but it is not clear they were originally pubs rooms.\n\nThe side bar is now accessed through a low doorway near the fireplace but staff say originally it was accessed from a door on the front right and the changes were over 35 years ago i.e. prior to Samuel Smiths ownership. It has a late 19th century panelled bar counter with decorative brackets in front of which is a linoleum trough area with a brass edging, but the mirrored bar back fitting is wholly modern. This long thin room contains old dado match-board panelling but the wall bench seating at the front  and rear right looks post war (which would tie in with a change to the front of the building) and there is a small cast iron fireplace at the rear possibly added by Samuel Smiths? The listed description (2004) states there was a late 19th century fireplace with red tiled surround?\n\nThe small room at the rear right has a doorway off the passage and new lino tiled floor. There is a massive stone fireplace original to the building and to the left of it is a genuine looking old hatch to the back of the servery but no longer in use as covered by a solid window. The dado of match-board panelling looks old but it is difficult to date the wall benches at the rear.\n\nThe small room on the front left of the building is now called the games room and has blocked up corner doors as it is now accessed via a doorway from the main bar. It has a dado of old match-board panelling on the exterior wall sides, modern lino tiled floor and a large Bass mirror but no sign of a fireplace. There is a disused door at the rear of the room as well as a new door from the main bar \u2013 the wall it is in appears a stud insertion. Beyond a short passage from a door on the Horsleydown Lane side there is another small room called the lounge accessed via a doorway with no old fittings \u2013 the wall on the right of the entrance appears a stud insertion.\n\nUpstairs is what is called the dining room and consists of three small areas with modern bar fittings and two fireplaces, one being a mid C19 marble one. Access to this upper room from the right-hand side of the pub is via an unusual early C19 winder staircase with stick balusters. It goes down to a small hall at the rear of the pub with doors to the small rear room and side bar.",

The original division of the space is readable in the ceiling beams which indicate the smaller rooms the ground floor once comprised, which would have offered public saloons, private rooms for customers and space for off-sales of alcohol.

        "Description": "A tucked-away three-storey brick pub re-built 1934 with three rooms, the first of which is little changed over the years and is said to hold the oldest excise licence in the City. \r\n\r\nThe front bar has a bare wood floor and the panelled bar counter with its curved central section looks like it could be inter-war (but Nicholsons are known for quality refurbishments). Look for the ledge on the door the staff use to get to the servery and you will see the wording \u201cWaitresses Only\u201d. The bar back lower shelves look to date from the 1930s (but three fridges have replaced the central section) and the top part has a lot of modern work. On the right is a 1930s brick fireplace in a wood surround, which may also be old. Radiators behind the fixed seating looks to date from just post-war. The toilets at the front part of the pub have small black and white chequerboard tiled floors and the dado wall tiling is of an inter-war style (but most tiles look modern). \r\n\r\nA short passage leads to a larger bar at the rear where the bar counter has a similar style but looks modern and the bar back is good but is also modern. The dado panelling around most of the room could be inter-war and there are more just post-war radiators and a number of 1930s inter-war leaded windows. The third room is the Martha\u2019s Cellar Bar / Dining Room downstairs which has a lovely semicircular wooden narrow panelled frontage and good old white marble top but the staff say the bar was changed 30 years ago from one straight across the room so is this an import? Another 1930s stained glass window at the rear.",

        "Description": "Built 1897 (in colourful plasterwork on the top right hand gable of the building) by Reffell\u2019s Bexley Brewery Ltd. (taken over by Courage & Co in 1956). Two-storey building of yellow brick with colourful plasterwork detail in the first floor and ground floor porch gables of a beehive, flowers and in the first floor one the wording \u2018The Beehive\u2019. Although now opened-up there are many original fittings remaining.  \n\nThe right hand entrance leads to the Public Bar, a large room with the original bar counter curved at both ends with the front now painted cream with black along the base and an old bar top however it appears to have been shortened on the right as there is no counter in front of the right hand section of the bar back. The original eight-bay bar back fitting survives with mirrored panels and doors in bays two and seven with good etched glass and coving possibly of anaglypta  along the top painted a pale orange. Most of the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. The dado panelling around the walls looks old but has been painted cream and on the right is a tiled, cast iron and marble fireplace that was originally in the managers office and has been moved here recently. A wide gap has been cut between the right and left hand areas of the pub. \n\nThe left hand entrance has a grand porch and leads to the Saloon Bar, another large room which was clearly sub-divided originally. In the vestibule entrance that was a modern addition there are doors with deep etched wording of \u201cPrivate Bar\u2019 and \u2018Bottles & Jugs\u2019 moved from elsewhere in the pub and there are more doors down the left hand side. There is a similar bar counter to that in the Public Bar and curved at both ends with the front now painted cream with black along the base and an old bar top. A door with \u2018Coffee Room\u2019 panel on it at the end of the bar back fitting led to a public room, but now a kitchen. The bar back fitting has a number of mirrored panels and a centre-piece of four snob screens, which may be in their original position as there was a Coffee Room behind. The small windows at the top are covered in blackboard paint \u2013 the present licensees removed the paint from the other parts of the bar back here. Some of the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. The cornice here includes English Rose symbols. \n\nThe rear part was a separate room and the entrance door was where the ladies is now. There is a good baffle / screen with a decorative etched and frosted panel situated in this area. There were three (of originally four) mirrors representing the seasons on the walls here but they were removed by owners Gladewood Taverns recently. There are two marble surround fireplaces with the one at the rear having an early 20th century red glazed brick interior and an ornate mantelpiece; the one at the front has a modern tiled interior. The conservatory-style room on the left was added possibly in the 1930s.",

It retains large Truman signs and eagles on the gables, and on the right hand Leroy Street side are three original Truman windows with golden lettering. Interestingly a fourth window in the same style advertises Courage Best, the current cask beer sold at the pub which suggests re-glazing. The front windows look to be replacements. \n\nIt has a U-shaped interior as all partitions removed \u2013 originally it was two (possibly three rooms) and off sales (the front middle disused door). Note the \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 brass plate on the corner door, \u2018Public Bar\u2019 one on the left hand door and a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 glazed panel in the rear right inner door (the right-hand side could have been subdivided in the past \u2013 but the indication of \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 from both doors may discount this?). Interestingly the right hand side retains its saloon bar carpet whilst the left is bare boards. \n\nThe original U-shaped counter has beer engine service doors and is fronted with a red and black chequer-board tiling. The central gantry is a mix of inter-war and modern work \u2013 until the late 2000s there were mirrored backings on both sides but now you can see through. At the same time a modern pot shelf was, thankfully, removed. At the rear of the servery is a former publican's office with glazed upper windows, now converted to a food servery on the right hand side.\n\nThe bar has original dado and limited panelling all round but the three vestibule entrances were added in the early 1990s. Many of the benches around the bar are former church pews with numbered seats: these were added a few years ago, but fit in well. There are three fireplaces with original surrounds with Art Deco styling but all are blocked-up \u2013 two by 1960s brick and one by panelling. Above the fireplaces at the front left and rear right (but not the rear left) are framed mirrors with Truman lettering. Excellent leaded windows to the toilet doors and also a \u2018Private\u2019 one. The Gents\u2019 on the right hand side and both Ladies\u2019 retain their inter-war cream and green tiling to dado height with white painted pebble-dash above, and original urinals in the case of the Gents\u2019.",

        "Description": "Built in Neo-Tudor style for Hoare & Co\u00a0in 1934, this is an especially well-preserved example of a small-scale urban pub, influenced by the improved pub movement. It is the work of Sidney C Clark, one of the most accomplished pub architects of the inter-war period.\nThe interior comprises two rooms which were connected, at a later date, by a corridor to the side of the servery that resulted in the latter being shortened.\u00a0\nThe public bar has picture-rail height slatted light oak panelling with vertical grooves and a fine brick fireplace with heavy lintel. WCs with original signage are positioned on the east side with their doors integrated into the panelling. The bar counter has a matched slatted and grooved treatment whilst a separate hatch counter is set to the east side. The bar back has a leaded mirror screen with emerald green border behind shelving on both sides. Above is a leaded glazed partition screen.\nThe panelling in the saloon bar is in a different (fielded) style though also to picture-rail height. There are two fireplaces, both with brick inserts with oak surrounds and overmantels; the latter integrate framed panels with original painted nautical scenes set under overhanging cornices. To the east of the counter is a snug, formerly the off-sales, which has had its partition removed. The counter itself is set on a tiled platform and has a series of recessed panels with protruding uprights set between to support the counter top.\nThe pub closed in 2017 and was under serious threat of redevelopment. In this light, Historic England listed the building at Grade II\u00a0but on the day of notification, the owners began stripping out the interior, with significant damage done to both the counters and bar-backs. Southwark Council took rapid enforcement action, obliging the owners to reinstate the serveries, using salvaged materials, and this has been done very well. The pub re-opened in February 2023.",

Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nRebuilt in 1899 it is a four-storey building of brick with a ground floor frontage having Larvikite with red granite pilasters (and capitals painted dark green). Note the elaborate lower window frames containing some etched and cut glass panels with broken pedimented central sections.  \n\nThe pub is effectively one room which retains many original fittings, including a decorative screen situated towards the rear which separated a small sung from the main bar before the double doors were removed. There is a colourful Victorian tiled floor at the front left of the room indicating a partitioned passage to what would have originally been a small bar. On the Bourlet Close side is a door that leads through a short passage to the rear part of the bar i.e. the pub looks to have had four small rooms originally. There is a wooden floor throughout. \n\nThere is a centrally placed, almost square servery with Victorian panelled bar counter \u2013 note the two different treatments with wooden decoration on the front three sides and round arched panels on the rear part. Very little remains of the bar back fitting and the pot shelf is modern.  \n\nThe screen has more etched and cut glass panels, the part over the servery has carved heads at the top both sides and a double faced clock.

In 2001 the pub was expanded into the shop next door on Portobello Road and there is a wide gap linking the two parts. \r\n\r\n(* According to 'Inn and Around London' by Helen Osborn, published by Young's Brewery in 1991, the freehold of this pub was bought by Mr H H Finch in 1890.)\r\n\r\nThere is a vestibule on the Portobello Road side which has three cut and etched narrow panels on one side. There are four other doors indicating there were five separate spaces originally but, remarkably, two full screens and some short ones still survive. Close to the vestibule entrance there is a low screen with a broken pediment at the top, a doorway and two narrow etched and frosted panels. There is another low screen on the left, Elgin Crescent side, with a doorway, good decorative etched and frosted panel either side and along the top. The room has wall panelling to about two-thirds height and along with the partitions it has been painted turquoise. \r\n\r\nThe late 19th century island bar counter has a panelled front and in recent years has been rubbed down to the bare wood. The bar back has some vestiges of the original \u2013 the top section with a broken pediment and painted turquoise remains as does part of the lower section but there is much modern work. There is an ornate ceiling possibly of Anaglypta. \r\n\r\nThe small room in the former shop part has no old fittings and there is another added-on area at the rear called the refectory which has modern tiling on the wall.",

        "Description": "A little gem hidden away in the back streets between the western end of the Old Kent Road and southern Bermondsey. Standing alone in an area that today is largely made up of industrial buildings, it is a survivor from another age. Built 1886 of brick with, on the frontage, a green glazed brick dado with cream glazed brick above and a rendered first floor. \n\nThe exterior of this small two-storey building is still adorned with old Truman signage. \u2018Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co Ltd\u2019 is painted on tiles around the top. Frosted windows still contain the Truman name. Above them is the legend \u2018Truman Burton The Victoria Brewed Bitter\u2019 in dark writing against pale tiles on the front and \u2018No.70\u2019 above the corner doors. \n\nInside it retains an island-style interior from inter-war times with the only significant change being the removal of partition walls that created an off-sales. The corner twin doors led to the public bar, the far left door to the smoke room and the centre one was the off sales. You can clearly see where it was as there is no black and white chequerboard tiling trough around the base of the counter in this area and markings on the bare wood floor indicating where the wooden partitions existed. \n\nThe inter-war bar counter remains with a number of doors for servicing beer engines and a black and white chequerboard tiling trough around the base so distinctive of Truman pubs. The mirrored island gantry style bar back remains and is noteworthy with its chamfered ends and till alcoves; remarkably all the lower shelving is intact. The pot shelf is modern. \n\nAll around the walls is a dado of inter-war fielded panelling and at the rear left is a dark red-brown glazed brick fireplace from the early 20th century. The lack of modern change is no doubt due to the present licensees having run the pub for 34 years (2017).",

Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nThree storey early Victorian building on corner of Essex Rd and Popham St.  Outside frontage of sea green marbled tiles to sill height then plain green tiles above to roof height with lintels.\n\nInside it is a pub of two halves with initial remodelling in 1930s.  The right hand part (fronting Popham St and Essex Rd) is the one that has some historic interest.  Originally three rooms now largely opened out though the front (former public bar?)  retains a partition separating it from the rest and cellar doors onto Essex Rd, plus 1930s panelling and woodwork.  Bar, curved at each end, appears to be 1960s plywood with fancy metal work supporting the pot shelf and illuminated Formica fascia, though bar top appears to be 1930s work.  Bar back again 1960s plywood construction.  Black and white chequered trough around bar.  Floor of pine boards with Stockholm tar but the parquet flooring has been removed.  Some inter-war panelling in rear section but also a modern laminate partition. Some c.1960s bench seating.  Dumb waiter in situ.  Tongue and groove boarded ceiling throughout.

        "Description": "Rebuilt in the late 1930s of brick with faience on the ground floor \u2013 two storeys and rooms in the roof above. It is named after the nearby Licensed Victuallers\u2019 Asylum. In contrast to contemporary connotations, this site was not a place where former pub landlords were hidden away; instead \u2018Asylum\u2019 is used in the older sense, meaning \u201csanctuary\u201d.\n\nWhen built the pub had four small rooms and today there are still three with some doorways cut in dividing walls so you can easily walk around all the rooms.\n\nThere are three doors on the Asylum Road side \u2013 the left one leads to the pool room; the middle one is access to the private quarters upstairs; and the right hand door was blocked up in the 1970s. The main entrance on the Meeting House Lane side leads to the large bar on the right and a wide doorway cut in the 1960s leads to the small bar on the left. Another door on the Kings Grove side also leads to the larger bar on the right.\n\nThe small pool room retains its original bar counter but in 2008 this was shortened by about two feet as the markings on the floor show. The bar back fitting is the original with two rows of mirrors and above a row of fielded panelling. The bar retains its original inlaid top. Prior to 2008 there were ante rooms for the ladies and gents toilets situated on the rear wall of this room and there was a way to access this room from the large bar by walking through either of the toilets. The panelling on the rear wall near the doorway gap created in 2008 was made to match the original fielded panelling on the dado, all of which is painted black. \n\nThe small bar also retains its original curved bar counter with doors for servicing beer engines and the front painted black (top was replaced in the mid 1990s) and fielded panelling to dado height also painted black. \n\nThe large bar retains its original bar counter with doors for servicing beer engines and a front painted black (top was replaced in the mid 1990s). The original bar back remains having two rows of mirrors and above a row of fielded panelling. Originally there was a partition with a low door in it for cleaners which was situated close to the gap in the counter for staff but it was taken away in the mid 1980s. There is a brick fireplace (age?) painted red.",

        "Address": "76 Narrow Street, Limehouse, E14 8BP",
        "Description": "Probably built between 1787 and 1797, when it was known as the Bunch of Grapes, the present fa\u00e7ade of this four- storey building is 19th century. The existence of two front doors would indicate a passageway previously existed for access to the rear room. \r\n\r\nThe front room is now accessed from the right hand door but is more likely to have been from the left hand door? It has a bare wood floor with full height old tongue and groove panelling on the left and bare benches attached which look old; also similar bare bench seating around the small bay window. The seating goes across the left hand door which suggests some re-arranging of the interior in recent years. There is a dado of oldish (possibly dating back to inter-war years?) panelling down the right hand wall and panelled ceiling painted a deep pink. The servery is situated in the middle of this narrow pub and consists of a counter that might be inter-war (the pot shelf is modern) and three sections of back fitting. The left hand part has shelves held up by pillars with a mirrored back which all look old. The middle section has a series of small mirrored panels with a few shelves and this looks genuinely old. The right hand section of shelves attached to tongue and groove panelling is much more modern. Currently owned by Sir Ian McKellen and two others, his staff from the Lord of the Rings trilogy is affixed to the bar back. \r\n\r\nA narrow passage alongside the staircase to the first floor leads to a small rear room. The counter front of tongue and grove panelling looks old but the top looks modern as does the door for staff. There is old dado panelling on the left hand wall with a bare bench attached and a 1930s (or 1950s?) brick fireplace but the dado panelling beyond is modern. There is a small balcony overhanging the River Thames and a restaurant room on the first floor overlooking the river (not inspected).\r\n\r\nThe Grapes is one of several laying claim to being the model for Dickens \u2018Jolly Fellowship Porters\u2019 in his book \u2018Our Mutual Friend\u2019. The politician David Owen lived next door from which \u2018The Limehouse Declaration\u2019, the manifesto of the Social Democratic Party, was issued in January 1981.",

        "Description": "Two storey of brick built 1923, probably by A E Sewell, for Truman\u2019s brewery. The ground floor exterior is entirely clad in cream faience above sill level, and in green tile below. \u2018The Royal Oak\u2019 in faience is on the fascia on both street sides and in a framed panel above the corner door is. Above that a panel is inscribed \u20181923 / TRUMAN / HANBURY / BUXTON / & CO LTD\u2019. There is a second double door centrally situated on the Columbia Road side with \u2018BOTTLE & JUG\u2019 etched into the glazing in both panels. \r\n\r\nOriginally there were partitions creating a public bar, off-sales, another bar, and a dining room at the rear right where the floor is boarded (which was likely to have been carpeted) \u2013 the rest having a parquet block one \u2013 but all the partitions have been removed so the interior is now open plan. The original central island bar servery with a fielded panelling front survives but only the lower part of the island gantry style bar back survives (and a lot of shelving lost to fridges), the top section having been removed. \r\n\r\nFielded panelling lines the walls to three-quarters height, and in certain areas has the names of beers inlaid - \u2018Trumans Eagle Ale\u2019, \u2018Trumans Imperial Stout\u2019, \u2018Trubrown Ale\u2019, \u2018Ben Truman\u2019, \u2018Barley Wine\u2019, \u2018Trumans Burton Brewed Bitter\u2019, and \u2018Mild Ales\u2019. However, the \u2018Ben Truman\u2019, \u2018Barley Wine\u2019, and \u2018Mild Ales\u2019 are on pieces of wood added to the panelling whereas the others are gilt lettering directly onto the panelling and look modern additions. Also on the walls lining the exterior is more fielded panelling topped with a row of green tiles under the windows, that can be opened vertically in summer. \r\n\r\nIn this rear right former dining room area there is a fireplace with a panelled timber surround (no panelling above the fireplace) and in the former public bar near the right hand entrance is a second fireplace with a brown glazed brick surround and is a less elaborate piece reflecting the lower status of the room. The ceiling is white Vitrolite panelling with timber ribs with small square bosses to the corners. Toilets are modernised throughout but do have modern light green brick shaped tiles throughout floor to ceiling. \r\n\r\nFrom the right hand door is a lobby (with a door to/from the public bar) and staircase to the first floor with a small section of panelling on the left hand side (modern handrail). The main room of the first floor has a bare wood floor, is open plan, and (uniquely in London?) retains an inter-war curved fielded panelled bar counter (modern top) and some modest shelves (age?) for a bar back. The room has two fireplaces: one has a simple painted oak surround with delicate mouldings and red tiling; the other has brown glazed brick and a timber mantel shelf. Note the old gas fitting near the top of the stairs to the first floor.",

        "Description": "Three storey late-Victorian pub of red brick with \u2018The Pear Tree\u2019 in stone relief at the apex of the building and carved heads in stone over the windows on the first floor. The ground floor has a larvikite finish and there are doors on the left and right with ornate cast-ironwork above including the wording \u2018The Pear Tree\u2019. The door on the left is now blocked so the interior was originally subdivided but any partitions were removed some time ago. The double doors to the right form the entrance into what would probably have been a small vestibule with doors leading to front and side bars. The same layout probably would have been in place to the left, creating originally a four-room pub, with the later addition of a room at the back. Markings on the bar top indicate the position of the partitions in Victorian times. Despite refits and removal of partitions, the pub has not suffered too much and retains an unspoiled feel. \r\n\r\nThe U-shaped bar takes up a large portion of the trading area and has an old counter which looks more inter-war than Victorian. Dark brown stained panels on the front may be original or a later addition. The bar back has three bays. To the left is a doorway. The other two bays contain a fine wooden stand with etched mirrors and multi-pane upper sections reaching the ceiling. A fireplace on the left has a carved wood surround and a 1930s brick interior; the one on the right has a carved wood surround and brown tiled interior that could be from an inter-war refit. The front area has recently painted widows to accentuate the pear connection. \r\n\r\nA doorway to the right that has been widened has curtains (very traditional) and leads to a small room with dado panelling painted, so difficult to date. There is a wood surround fireplace that has been filled in. A large mirror with a tarnished carved wood frame has been painted off-white. There is a hatch to the back of the servery. Opens at 5pm Mon to Fri.",

There are three entrance doors \u2013 the left one has a \u2018Lounge Bar\u2019 etched window, the middle one a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019, and a Public Bar\u2019 one on the right. These etched windows are all replacements, probably introduced when Fullers bought the pub. The centre door (with the Saloon Bar window) leads to what was the off sales, or Jug & Bottle bar; alterations to the bar counter here (where the modern snob screens are sited) show the location of the erstwhile J&B bar. But the pub now has an open plan L-shaped interior. \n\nThe panelled bar counter looks very inter-war in style with pilasters but the pot shelf with barley twist pillars is a later addition, as are the snob screens. The bar back fitting has columns and capitals painted in gold as are the brackets above. The narrow mirrored panels on the bar back look Victorian (the one barley twist looks modern) but the mirror panels along the top less so and there are modern additions; most lower shelving lost to fridges. The bar back extends beyond the bar counter on the left hand return so the counter has been shortened in recent years. Most dado panelling looks modern and painted a gastro-mushroom colour but that on the rear right and the baffles by the ladies\u2019 and gents\u2019 are old. There is a small rear left room through a widish gap that is a modern addition. Open kitchen. \n\nThe building has clearly been extended to the right, demonstrated by the different brickwork and lack of external embellishments to that found on the original part of the building. This possibly dates from the 1960s when the building was extended to form toilet accommodation.",

        "Description": "Re-built in 1955 by Watneys this is a two-storey building of brick with a roundel on the corner depicting the head of Queen Elizabeth I. It has three / four rooms with the two main bars having separate entrances and, unusually these days, it is not possible to move between the two. \n\nThe Saloon Bar on the right has an entrance in Lytham Street and there is a now disused door to the left which was to the off sales and while the counter survives the partition that separated it has long since disappeared. There is a massive Bass mirror on the wall here. The bar counter is the original with its distinct 1950s style vertically panelled front and black melamine inlaid top. On the right hand side of the counter frontage there is what looks like a cupboard. These are seen in some Victorian and inter-war pubs in London and are believed to be there to allow access to the beer engines so this looks like a rare post-war example? Around the base of the counter are red and black tiles which look modern; the pot shelf is definitely modern. The original mirrored bar back fittings with an illuminated top panel with the wording \"Welcome to this Watney House\" remains but the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. There is an original wood surround and tiled fireplace but the hearth is modern and the tiles painted red. \n\nTo the rear on the right is a further small room separated from the Saloon Bar by a two part sliding screen with glazed panels that is now usually in the open position. There is a bar counter that is more like a large hatch and behind the servery here is a dumb waiter. There is an original wood surround and tiled fireplace but the hearth is modern and the tiles painted red. The gents\u2019 off the saloon bar retains the original tiles but has new urinals; the ladies\u2019 has the original tiles. \n\nFrom the entrance on Merrow Street is a two-part Public Bar which also retains what looks like a 1950s bar counter although less ornate than the saloon bar one and has a black melamine inlaid top. Around the base of the counter are red and black tiles which look modern; the pot shelf is definitely modern. The bar back fitting is the original one with the wording \"Welcome to this Watney House\" at the top but here it is not illuminated; three mirror backed arches part may be from the 1950s however the main shelf with its black melamine inlaid top definitely is. Half of the lower shelves remain, the rest lost to a fridge; the pot shelf is definitely modern. There is another original wood surround and tiled fireplace with the tiles painted red and a modern hearth which is blocked-up. \n\nA wide gap on the left (no sign it ever had a sliding screen) leads to a small area with a wood laminate floor. The small curved counter here is the same as the main public bar one but whereas the other sections of counter (saloon bar and public bar) have tiles in front of them here there is an exposed wooden base. Either the tiles are modern additions or in the far left area the tiling was removed recently? There is another original wood surround and tiled fireplace with the tiles painted red and a modern hearth which is blocked-up. With no sign of a exterior door it is likely that this area was always like this. The gents\u2019 has lost its original urinals but retains original tiling as does the ladies\u2019. There is no obvious original fixed seating.",

The bar counter which is at two angles looks to be at least from the 1930s, (less ornate than that on the right) but painted turquoise and its position does match the bar back. The original bar back fitting has coving at the top with floral detail picked out in gold, mirrored sections and some with modern tiles. The lower shelving on the right hand side has been lost to fridges but is intact on the left side. The dado panelling is modern painted a dull green colour and a fireplace has been lost. The exterior windows have an inter-war style but most are modern replacements. There is an open kitchen in the rear section of the room. In the refurbishment of September 2016 Enterprise made a vast improvement by removing imposing pot shelves. \n\nThe right hand entrance in Codrington Hill up a terrazzo staircase also leads into a vestibule with double doors but is not currently in use. Access to the right hand bar is via a part glazed full height screen which looks original with double doors always open. The right hand bar has a floor covering of modern lino laid diagonally and the full height wall and ceiling panelling looks modern and painted a dull green colour. The curved bar counter here is definitely the original with three pilasters and the front is painted turquoise. The small section of original bar back is as that in the left hand bar and the lower shelving here is intact.",

        "Description": "Three storey of yellow London brick with a wooden ground floor frontage possibly late Victorian. It retains an interior of three small rooms formed by two screens (increasingly rare for London) around a centrally placed servery. There are signs of 4 exterior doors so an off sales on the Thornville Street side might have been lost. \r\n\r\nThe three counter fronts are genuinely old with pilasters and good strapwork along the top and if you look behind the servery there are deep drawers and cupboards of some age. Look for the cupboard in the counter front of the middle bar which are seen in some Victorian and inter-war pubs in London and are believed to be there to allow access to the beer engines. The door for staff situated at the far left end is very curved. Throughout the pub there is an old panelled dado which is painted cream and the detail in light brown. There are two island bar back fittings the lower half of which do look genuinely old and painted white but the top sections are of modern wood, possibly 70/80s? Around the base of the counter is a foot rail but here it is a rare working heated one. \r\n\r\nThe two screens that separate the interior into three bars have lower parts with wood that nearly matches that on the counter front but not quite and the wood and glazing in the top half looks modern. The screens are likely to be in their historic position but they look more modern / 1970/80s than original so possibly Samuel Smiths replacements. S E London pub guide (1988) states the screens were there i.e. they are clearly not recent Sam Smiths additions. One screen retains a door, the other has lost its door. In 1988 the pub had an upstairs pool room but now private quarters.",

It was subject to a significant refit by Charringtons in c.1936 and the glazed stone ground floor was added including the two \u2018House of Toby\u2019 ceramic signs on the far left and right of the ground floor \u2013 the Toby symbol was owned by Hoare & Co. who were taken over by Charringtons in 1934.

In around the mid 1990s a partition from the former door on New Cross Road side to the bar counter and another partition was situated in the south west corner of the pub where there was a gents\u2019 toilet. \r\n\r\nThe counter has a fielded panelled front on the rear side and one of vertical panelling that looks more like a 1950s style on the front side; the bar top has a melamine inlaid top. The island gantry looks original with the wording at the top on both sides of \u201cAles Charrington Stout\u2019 with small panels left and right with \u2018Wines\u2019 and \u2018Spirits\u2019 but most wording has been painted over but the east side main wording can be seen by the clever positioning of a mirror. Pot shelf is modern. There is a dumb waiter on the bar top, one section of original fixed seating with a wood back, and an inter-war wood surround fireplace on the front left but it has a modern interior (fireplace at ear right is modern). \r\n\r\nNear the remaining in use door on Lewisham Way are two baffles which contained trade-mark Charringtons inter-war leaded glazed panels. \r\n\r\nThe exterior of this prominent pub on an angled road junction was in July 2017 subjected to a mural called (By the Way) commissioned by Artmongers.

        "Description": "Built c.1870 of three-storeys by Watney\u2019s Brewery of London stock brick with a tiled ground floor. The ox blood-coloured exterior tiling incorporates advertisements for (on the left) \u201cReid\u2019s Stout\u201d (on the right ) \u201cWatney\u2019s Ales\u201d. Thick paint had been applied in recent times but thankfully the tiling and advertisements were returned to their original condition in 2015. Four exterior doors are evidence of the former multi-room layout. The original layout consisted of a public bar on the left (may have been subdivided); saloon bar on the front right separated from the public bar by a toilet and a short partition between the exterior wall and halfway along the east facing counter front; and at the rear right a function or billiard room. It is believed that the partition mentioned in the listing description (1999) was a modern insertion and has since been removed.  \r\n\r\nThe interior is now open-plan and through an impressive wide arch with brackets spaced regularly along it is an area at the rear on a lower level and with no old fittings. The front L-shaped part of the pub has a bare wood floor, there are two cast iron columns with elaborate capitals painted gold within the servery and some original ceiling decoration remains. \r\n\r\nThe original bar back fitting remains substantially intact albeit that there have been some changes in recent years. It faces two-sides with five bays on the right including some very old aged mirrors, a couple of Watney\u2019s stag logos (which look modern), cut and etched glass and gilded glass advertisements for \u201cwines\u201d and \u201cliqueurs\u201d. There is a suspended clock with a carved surround including \u20181874\u2019. On the left hand side there are four bays with some deep cut mirror panels some of which look modern. Two-thirds of lower shelving has been lost to fridges.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter is the original although two small sections on the far right (one served the rear function room) were lost in changes in 2000 to create an upstairs hotel. A section of the bar counter that protruded in the south east corner was removed in 2000 and re-instated in 2015 as part of re-instatement works as listed building consent had not been obtained for the changes in 2000. The original bar top had been removed in recent times and replaced with one of chipboard covered in a white plastic material however in 2015 a replacement mahogany one was added. The wood surround fireplace on the left is old but moved from elsewhere and now painted a gastro grey colour. \r\n\r\nMuch information obtained from  Listed Building Consent application No. DC/16/095391 on Lewisham Councils website",

The interior is just one room now but the existence of three entrances (the right one has a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 frosted glass window) show it was originally split by partitions into separate rooms. \r\n\r\nThe room has deal boarding to the dado painted battleship grey, two marble fireplaces (cast-iron interiors look modern), a late-19th century island bar-back with engraved and faceted glass in the top part, and a bar counter probably of the same period. The listed description states the bar counter and bar back have probably been reset and possibly altered. \r\n\r\nThe counter front has ornate brackets and is painted black with parts (new panels added?) painted in gold. The island back fitting has columns holding up the main shelf, a door for staff, and it still retains a good part of its lower shelving. Note the stranded dumb waiter on the right which add weight to the theory that the bar counter has moved. A good vestibule with star burst in panels at the top has a door with \u2018Toilets & Box Office\u2019 in deep cut glass. \r\n\r\nThe internationally renowned Kings Head Theatre Pub was founded in 1970 and run by one family for 41 years. With 110 seats it is one of the largest pub theatres in London and now home to an Olivier Award winning opera and theatre company with shows nightly. The theatre is situated at the rear and until recently there was another small room used for dining between the public bar and the theatre. \r\n\r\nFor years after \u2018Decimal Day\u2019 prices here continued to be quoted in pounds shillings and pence using an ornate Art Deco till which has \u00a31 as its biggest figure so you used to hear lots of 'rings' for most transactions!

        "Address": "58 High Street, High Barnet, EN5 5SJ",
        "Description": "This ancient and very beautiful inn, dating originally from the seventeenth century, contains four separate drinking areas.  The two front rooms are the oldest, although the partition between them has been partially removed, creating a wider opening between the two.  The original front door, opening into the snug area, has also been closed and a more modern (although still old) opening created into the longer front side bar.  The L-shaped bar counter, made from varnished wood and probably Victorian, opens into both these spaces, and the bar incorporates a fireplace of some antiquity, with an original crazed tiling surround.  The back of bar appears to be more recent.  Old wooden wall panelling in the side bar has been cut to fit the uneven ceiling, and small hinged windows with modern glass open into the carriage passage running alongside the building.\r\n\r\nBehind the two front drinking spaces is a lower bar which appears to have been refurbished more recently, although the outer walls are faced with what may be early 20th century panelling.  Half timbering on the interior wall appears to be more recent.  The flagged floor is partly covered by a modern carpet.  The layout of the room may have been modified, with a curved half wall next to the seating area appearing to have been added to separate a corridor space leading to the rear of the building. There is an original serving hatch opening from the bar area.\r\n\r\nBeyond the lower bar is a lengthy corridor which leads past the toilets to a rear room which was once a stables and more recently has been used for storage.  It was converted into a drinking space in 2013.  Many original features from the stables remain \u2013 including two thirds height, still functioning doors with the upper half barred which originally opened into the main stables area, and the original paved floor.  Doors into the garden appear to be modern, presumably replacing half doors originally opening into stables compartments.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to recognize many of the original features in this inn, particularly in the two front rooms.  There have been some changes to the layout, however, principally the removal of partitions to create wider door spaces, the moving of the front door originally leading into the snug, the probable alterations to the lower bar, and the recent renovation of the stables area.  Nonetheless this is a highly attractive and congenial place to drink and eat, and well worth making a detour to visit.",

Chiswick 1910\", and two oriel windows held up by a cartouche of mauve tiles. \r\n\r\nDouble entrance doors with stained glass panels in Art Nouveau style and brass plates. Left hand door is now bricked up. The lobby on the right hand side has a blue glazed brick dado with cream tiles above having swagged motifs. On the right is a three-bay glazed screen with a door in the third bay which led to public bar at the front which retains a good wood surround painted gastro-grey colour and cast-iron fireplace. \r\n\r\nA 1930s plan shows a layout of a partitioned corridor running all the way to the rear where there is a skylight (now covered over) and a four room pub. A public bar at the front, off to the left were two private bars and a saloon bar at the rear. \r\n\r\nA plan from 1966 plan shows that two of the rooms had been amalgamated by 1966, with two further rooms being amalgamated as part of the 1966 refurbishment i.e. the whole of the rear section had been opened-up as a result of removing most of the partitions with only one separating the public bar remaining. The plan also shows new lavatories were installed in the public bar, replacing the left-hand vestibule and closing a second entrance to the public bar. Down the right hand wall from the interior doors (that are relatively modern) is a dado of original fielded panelling now painted gastro \u2013grey. \r\n\r\nThe three-sided bar back looks to be the 1910 one but originally there was an office around which were two parts of bar back \u2013 one facing forward and the other on the return. Probably in 2009 (a planning application was submitted in that year, but is not available for inspection) the office was removed and the two pieces of bar back now make the return section \u2013 note how they have wooden pillars at the top i.e. different to the other part of the bar back. The bar counter looks to be an inter-war one with a lino inlaid top however there have been changes \u2013 having removed the office creating more space in the servery the counter on the left has been shortened and moved back to give more space for customer. The plan of 1930 shows the return part was level with the fireplace \u2013 note the change in the bare wood floor. The changes in c.2009 also saw the removal of a further length of the side passage, leaving only a vestibule next to the remaining entrance door; and the removal of the 1966 lavatories from the public bar. \r\n\r\nAt the rear in what was the saloon is an original ornate wood surround fireplace with a mirrored mantlepiece all painted a gastro-grey colour. Fielded panelling at the rear is painted a deep pink colour. The skylight at the rear remains but the part glazed screens are modern. \r\n\r\nThe late Queen Mother visited in 1989 as Patron of the London Garden Society to inspect the floral display.",

The bar back fitting looks like a island-style one but abuts the counter so again where was it positioned originally?",

        "Description": "1930s fittings. Of particular note are the two brick fireplaces, one with a wooden Tudor arch, and another with a brick Tudor arch. The back room with its skylight certainly looked like an old billiards room (the landlady didn't know), and the doors leading from the back room with their Tudor arched tops certainly look inter-war. The bar back looked more modern, but the counter front and wall panelling also looked inter-war. Also of real interest is the matchboard panelled ceiling in the front room (seen in one of the attached photos). The front room would originally have been divided into three areas - a small bar (possibly public) on the right; a jug and bottle bar in the centre (unused doorway still in evidence); and a slightly larger bar (possibly saloon) on the left.  \r\n\r\nSubject to a quality refit in the inter-war period. The doors to the original coaching arch on the right look older but presumably 1930s? There are three front doors \u2013 Public Bar, Off Sales, and Private Bar from left to right but they all lead to the one space now. The bar counter could date to the inter-war period with the front recently painted teal blue but the bar back is modern. The Victorian-style wood surround and tiled fireplace is out of place.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear is what was a separate \u2018better room\u2019 which is lit by a fine skylight (with modern glass). There is a splendid large Tudor Arch-shaped stone fireplace with an inter-war brick interior. The three-bay over mantle has diagonally set 1930s brick. There is a dado of inter-war fielded panelling around the room / area and an ornate cornice.  \r\n\r\n\r\nLPG Crawl says description is: -  \r\n\r\nA pub on this site was a coaching inn for those heading north from London. Inside there are several (inter-war probably) heritage features. The fielded wood panelling on the walls is old, as is the bar counter front, and the unusual Tudor arch topped doors at the back are an interesting feature. There are brick built fireplaces on both sides of the main bar area which are clearly original, as is the rare diagonal (grey-painted) matchboard panelling on the ceiling. This room would once have been divided into three - what was probably the public bar on the right; a jug and bottle bar leading from the now unused door in the centre; and a saloon bar on the left. There is a fairly large room at the back which has a large skylight which suggests that it may have been a billiards room. On the right, behind the large double doors leading from the street is a \"function room\", which is effectively a small outside conservatory. Past that is an outside area with an outside toilet and storage buildings that may have been stables; then a large covered seating area with its own bar counter; then a large garden at the back. \n This history  states the pub was bought by Meux the brewers in 1837.   \r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, states the stone outside The Griffin public house which is commonly known as the Whetstone, is in fact a mounting block.  \r\n\r\nRex Ward email 5th Sept 2017 \r\n\r\nI managed to get up to the Griffin. I had a chat with the landlady, who had only been there a short while, but gave me some information. She said that it used to be a coaching inn for travellers heading north out of London; that the pub itself was not listed, but that the building at the back behind the pub (ex stables I would surmise) is Gde II listed. Not had time to check the listing yet. She said that there had been a fire in the late 1920s which possibly preceded and necessitated the 1930s fitting mentioned by John.  \r\n\r\nOf particular note are the two brick fireplaces, one with a wooden Tudor arch, and another with a brick Tudor arch. The back room with its skylight certainly looked like an old billiards room (the landlady didn't know), and the doors leading from the back room with their Tudor arched tops certainly look inter-war.

        "Description": "Built in the apex of a stone built terrace of houses in c.1836. It retains four rooms and is little altered due to the long serving landlady Irene Spencer (1955 to 1997) and still in the same family. The only change is in the room in the apex which was a snooker room and in c.1955 Mr & Mrs Spencer decided to to block up the original door on the left of the fireplace in the bar and on the right cut a wide opening to make it easier to get into the room, which retains fixed seating. However, that on the left side is only dated from 2003 as previously there was a dart board in this area. The fixed benches are an example of the excellent work Samuel Smiths do that can make modern work appear like it has been there for years! The main entrance leads to a tiny, colourful tiled floor lobby with a hatch for off-sales still with a display of bottles in glass cases all around it, but which has been moved back 2/3 feet into the entrance lobby. \r\n\r\nThe bare boarded small main bar on the right has a U-shaped 1890s carved wood counter and part mirrored bar-back fitting. The cast iron fireplace replaced an old range fireplace in the mid 1950s. On the main road side there is an unusual cupboard in the panelling which is presently the storage are for domino table tops. It original reason for being there is not known but it is situated close to the drop to the cellar outside and the manager would welcome any explanation. \r\n\r\nLeft of the lobby is the small smoke room with a fine tall bar-back fitting with narrow shelves and multiple mirrored panels, and another fine panelled and pilastered two-sided bar counter The fixed seating and tiled & cast-iron fire surround is no doubt contemporary with the main bar work. The fourth room is the pool room from which the fixed seating was removed in the mid 1990s. Service to the fourth room would have been via the glazed stable door to the servery with its tiny window (now sealed up). It is situated in the passage that runs from the left bar around the back of the servery to the main bar, and has an open staircase with carved Newel post.",

Match-board panelled ceiling but the fixed seating is also modern. \r\n\r\nThe back area (named as 'Buffet and Lounge' in the etched glass on the left-hand side) retains its semi-circular segmental-shaped mahogany bar counter with heavy detailing and a Queen Anne style fine bar-back fitting with a pair of high-level glazed cupboards and bevelled mirror panels. The inevitable fridges have replaced the lower bar back shelving. Also there is a splendid fire surround with classical detailing but reproduction tiled and cast-iron interior. there is a fine rear curved window featuring stained and leaded patterns.

The fixed seating and the baffles/screens with glazed panels in the top are all modern. \r\n\r\nNote the water taps on both front and rear bar counters - that on the front bar still works (the rear bar one is not connected). Water taps are rare in England (but there are many in Scotland) as whisky is the only spirit that benefits from a little water. At the rear are the former stables - note the coaching arch on the left of the pub. A building on the rear left might looks like it may have been a brewery in the past.",

The bar counter, bar-back, fireplace and panelling are of good age and supplemented by an amazing collection of nautical artefacts collected over the last 90 years or so. The former commercial room was converted into the 'Cabin Bar' in 1954 and is untouched since with ply panelled walls, bar counter front, Formica top bar etc. Part of the private quarters are now a reception and dining rooms.",

The public bar with 'Select Bar' on the door from the corridor is virtually unchanged since then with a tiled fireplace, high-backed fixed seating and a bar counter which was a hatch in a screen until the early 1970s and 70s ply panels cover old wood on the front. \r\n\r\nOn the left is another public room also with 1950s fireplace and more high-backed fixed seating which creates a passage from the entrance. Note the tiny corner Formica top tables in the seating. There is no till just a drawer. The corridor on the right has a hatch which acted as the reception for the hotel. Across the corridor there is a lounge, formerly the dining room which is used for meetings, functions etc. and has another 1950s fireplace. Famous visitors include Ramsey MacDonald and his daughter Isabel in 1931 (there is a photo in the kitchen) and Ted Heath visited in 1971 (and 1982?) - see the photo on the bar back.",

The main servery is to the public bar (front left), a smaller one to the lounge at the rear while the room to the right of the central corridor has a small, three-sided counter front which steps forward as it rises. This is clearly 1930s work and part of what seems to have been an extensive 'brewers' Tudor' refit from the time - see the mock half-timbering, beams, chunky rustic tables (three cut from elm), red brick fire surrounds, and two inglenook fireplaces. The two counter fronts were the work of former landlord, Charlie Abbey, who, as a skilled joiner, fashioned them from old country house furniture and installed in the 1950s: he is buried in the churchyard. \r\n\r\nThe front bar with a figure '2' on the door has a 1930s brick fireplace painted red, the fixed seating could be 1950s or later. The front right small room with a figure '1' on the door has a brick fireplace in a 1930s inglenook but the fixed seating looks more post war. A red and black tiled and panelled passage to the rear widens out and there is an off sales hatch complete with rising window but always open, also a table and chairs for passageway drinking. The rear bar has another ornately carved bar counter installed in the 1950s and there is another fine brick fireplace from the 1930s in an inglenook, fixed seating is post-war.",

The same idiosyncratic High Victorian spirit is found in the aggressively detailed bar-back with its decoratively carved brackets and mirrored panels. Stylistically all this looks like work of the 1860s or 1870s and, if so, is very early in terms of surviving pub fittings in this country but such things are notoriously hard to date since they could often be a decade or two behind the latest fashions. The counter is contemporary and also has very individual details including more decorative brackets. \r\n\r\nAll this is set in an L-shaped bar with a Victorian tiled fireplace and tongue-and-groove ceiling. Look on the Beech Street side and you will see two disused doors and on Hanover Place side another door as well as the main corner one so there were originally partitions dividing up this space. The rear door on Beech Street was possibly the door for off sales and the present modern rear partition replacing the original partition and with service from the doorway in the rear passage. \r\n\r\nThe small room at the rear through an arch inserted in modern times (or down passage from other end of the bar) has a Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace with a mirrored mantelpiece and a hatch to the back of the bar. Half-height wall-panelling throughout. Note the removable screens in the lower parts of the windows: these provided customers with both privacy and some protection from draughts and can be individually removed to increase the light from the windows - very rare. panelled ceiling throughout. The glazed stained and leaded screens are new. Look for three tables with bells in the centre for table service and some fold up seats from Roker Park 1898-1997.",

The fixed seating indicates this could have happened in the 1960s and there is an Art Deco-style wood surround fireplace which is difficult to date and may well have been imported from elsewhere. There is a splendid small room at the rear with older fixed seating and a hatch to the back of the bar. On the right is the games room, which also has a hatch for service. Sadly, the wall between the rear and right rooms was removed in the last century. \r\n\r\nAcross the road the Tap & Spile is run on very traditional lines with four small rooms and a passageway with hatch. There are few old fittings \u2013 indeed, the present counter is in a different position to the original one \u2013 but there is a wide choice of real ales in this Durham CAMRA Pub of the Year.",

        "Description": "The Centurion Bar on Newcastle Central Station is one of the most spectacular buildings you can visit in the city. It was not built as the busy bar it is today but, rather, was created in 1892-3 by the North Eastern Railway\u2019s architect, William Bell, as the first class refreshment room. The walls were clad with full-height faience (glazed earthenware) by Burmantofts of Leeds and given a faience clad lantern. Even the columns have this ceramic cladding. Quite a place to start your train journey!",

The left recessed entrance porch (brought back into use by new owner) has a mosaic terrazzo floor, original 'Bar' etched and frosted panels in the twin doors and unusual brown ceramic niche. Sadly, original etched and frosted curved windows with a railway theme have been replaced with plain ones. Originally the interior was of four rooms; however, many old fittings remain. In 2015 it was purchased from brewery owners by a private individual who has sensitively restored it (and re-introduced real ale).  \r\n\r\nThe left hand side of the pub interior is little altered with a bare wood floor, the original curved Edwardian mahogany bar counter, and the old fireplace has been sandblasted, re-lacquered and has a modern stove fire. The original curved bar back fitting is of 5 bays and is little altered with only one fridge having replaced some lower shelves, two other fridges have been sensibly placed under the bar counter. The original fixed seating  - curved in the front bay window and along two sides at the rear - has been recently re-covered. The colourful skylight looks like it was added in the 1970/1980s.  \r\n\r\nIn 1980/1990s a new bar counter on the front right and new bar counter and bar back at the rear right were added to create an island servery - if you look carefully you will see the left and right sides are of similar design but different wood. At the rear there is some more curved original fixed seating which has recently been re-covered. The rear right games room and front snug are opened-up and have no old fittings.",

The front door leads direct to one of the original rooms, but only the fireplace is of any age.  However, the back wall has been removed so it's now open to a staircase and two corridors.  On the right is the characterful main bar which has a sturdy, plain bar counter (1950s?) with simple shelving behind.  The slate fireplace is modern.  The 'back bar' and restaurant are both recent converts to pub use and contain nothing of interest. A framed 'for sale' leaflet from 1896 describes the building as having 'two front rooms, a large kitchen and bedrooms over'.",

Entrance is through the original farm house door, then a short corridor and a stone arch into the pub. On the left is what was the snug while on the right was the main bar - it's all one room now. The snug section has good panelling (possibly old) and a curious small door to the non-public area. In the main bar area the long bar counter is a real mish-mash, constructed from bits of old churches, which is where a lot of the furniture and fittings came from. Part of the ceiling sports a superb moulded section which apparently came from a four-poster bed! The cast-iron fireplace pre-dates the renovations. A small, low corridor leads to the back room, at a lower level; this was formerly a Blacksmith's shop - not sure when it was incorporated into the pub. It has rough cast walls, slate floor, a good timbered ceiling and ex-church stained glass windows. The Hole in't wall is between this room and the main bar and was supposedly used by the landlord to pass pints to the blacksmith.",

Rear lounge is a large room opened-up with modern fittings having originally been three rooms. The splendid decoratively tiled, cast iron and marble surround fireplace could be an import and the fixed seating in two areas modern? \r\n\r\nOpen staircase has a good carved newel post. Good Art Nouveau windows on the half landings between both first and second floor and second and third floor. Upstairs has quality dado panelling along the passage and at the rear is the Billiard Room with lots of original windows but the good quality bar fittings were probably added by Holts? Has a dumb waiter , vaulted ceiling, a dome covered up and a '9' button on the door.

Through the left-hand door is a passage with tiled floor and attractive dado tiling. Halfway down, a hatch still offers service from the back of the servery. Inside are two small rooms on different levels with a widish gap between them. As noted, the public bar with its bare wood floor and fixed seating, has seen post-war changes. Much of the rear saloon d\u00e9cor is from the 1930s: an Art Deco fireplace with  bevelled mirror in the mantelpiece, dado panelling, baffles and (probably) the \u2018ladies\u2019 stained glass panel. Another wooden floor here but the fixed seating seems quite recent.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nFormed out of a pair of late 18th century terraced houses in a area that has been redeveloped. The original layout and fittings were well preserved in the expansion of this now tucked away pub that received the Joe Goodwin Conservation Award in the 1985 CAMRA Pub Design competition. The highlight is the screened servery serving both the L-shaped lobby bar and the bare wood floor creaking wooden floor, attractive wood panelled and half glazed partitions with some coloured glass embellishment. \n\nOpposite the lobby servery is a small snug with doorway in part glazed partition wall with draught screens either side. It retains original fixed seating with bell pushes in a narrow strip of panelling above and a tiled, cast iron and good wood surround fireplace. What is now the bare boarded pool room is formed of a glazed partition off the lobby with a door, the part glazed bar back and two other walls all with dado panelling, and there is a small Victorian cast iron fireplace with some tiles at the top. The bar back is therefore shelves on the partition that is one wall of the pool room which has a split doorway for staff and two small hatches.  \n\nAt the end of the passage with old dado panelling on the right and the glazed partition wall around the pool room on the left leads to a larger room with the figure '4' on the door. The room has unusual fan-like panelling down one side, seating bays that may be post war and an early 20th century tiled, cast and marble surround fireplace. there is a figure '7' on the door to the cellar. In 19XX an extension was built overlooking the crown bowling green that was in existence in 1842 and the pub was built alongside it. During redevelopment of the area in the early 1980s it was re-aligned to its present position at the rear of the pub and is still in regular use and available for parties. One former exterior window is now a hatch for service.",

On Shaw Street (left hand) side are double doors with \u2018Outdoor\u2019 in stone above.

All the panelling is modern as is the bar counter and bar back. A brick fireplace at the rear is about the only remaining original feature here but the gents\u2019 does have its original tiled floor and four big urinals (the wall tiles are modern). Ladies not inspected. \n\nRight hand front door has \u2018Lounge\u2019 in stone above and leads to a large room that was at least two.

It appears to retain its original bar counter and original bar back fitting with Tudor rose symbols. On the right side is more original fielded panelling to picture frame height but a dumb waiter near the door looks like a later addition. The panelling here looks similar to that on the bar counter so may have come from the former counter in the public bar? On the far right a wall has been removed to open up a room with more original fielded panelling to picture frame height, a large stone fireplace with Tudor arch interior, bell pushes, good plasterwork detail on three sections of the ceiling. There is a modern raised area near the windows. \n\nAt the rear a doorway leads to the snug with original fielded panelling to picture frame height all around the room, a Tudor arch stone and inter-war brick interior fireplace, original fixed seating, bell pushes in the panelling and it is served via a counter which looks like a modern replacement for a hatch and the counter front looks like it could be a re-use of the former lounge bar counter? The room has a good decorative cornice, a plasterwork floral pattern in four corners and Tudor rose symbols in plaster relief all around the edge of the ceiling. There is more plasterwork decoration below the cornice. The name comes from the 9th hole of Hoylake's Royal Liverpool Golf Course.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020. Owners Punch Taverns have replaced all the 1930s fittings with modern ones. This pub has therefore been re- categorised as Interior Ruined. The former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nRebuilt in the 1930s it still retains a much of its original interior some recent erosion of layout and fittings. It is a good example of an interior with a centrally-placed shuttered bar servery serving a number of rooms. The interior porch has a black and white tiled floor covered by carpet and inner doors with leaded 'Hop Pole' and 'Hotel' panels on them leads to a hall with a new tiled floor. The floor-to-ceiling island servery has a series of service windows and in recent years replacement panelled counter fronts have been painted brown and all the structure above painted cream. The upper fixed glazed panels remain but all the lower rising panels have been removed: the bar top is modern and a small section of modern bar-back has been added. \n\nOn the front right the tap room / public bar has a red tiled floor and retains original fixed seating in two sections. Originally the door from the lobby led into an off-sales but the partition was removed in the mid 1990s. It extended as far as the first two windows of the servery and had its own bench seating. The panelling on the servery within the public bar matches the dado panelling on the walls but is different to that on the counter front in the lobby and may be modern wood but being painted it is difficult to be certain. The original glazed brick and wood surround fireplace was replaced by a modern addition in 2012. The public bar door on the right side of the building is still in use and has its own lobby probably with a black and white tiled floor but covered by carpet and through the inner door is a baffle / draught screen.  \n\nThe front left room is in two distinct parts - the first has low baffles / screens as you enter and fixed seating in bays to the front and rear with bell-push remains in a panel above. Through a gap between the bays a larger area now houses a pool table but up to 2012 there were another two bays of fixed seating here. Also, a 1930s brick, Tudor-style stone and rough-hewn wood surround fireplace has been replaced by a modern one.  \n\nThe rear left room retains most of its original fixed seating in bays and in two distinctive parts - the first area has two L-shaped pieces of fixed seating with bell pushes and is different to that in the second area with its two bays at the front and one at the rear so there has been changes to the fixed seating in the first area of the room. In the second area a 1930s tiled and wood surround fireplace has been replaced by a modern tiled one. The room on the rear left has seen the wall between it and the hallway removed in modern times and also three holes have been cut in the upper part of the wall between the two left rooms 'for supervision'. Note the leaded screen above one of the rear seating bays - originally these were to be found on top of all the bays - many were removed in 2012 and only a bit remains.  \n\nModernised gents'. Function room upstairs has modern fittings. Active bowling green at the rear. Crewe Modelling and Engineering Society have their HQ in the upstairs room over the garage - the club meets every Wed at 8pm. Opens at 1pm Mon to Thu; 12 Fri to Sun.",

        "Description": "A three-room, timber-framed, thatched former farmhouse built 1793. It was held for many years until 1999 by the same family and thus experienced little change. Originally there was no counter and one stood by the door to the servery to order drinks which were fetched from the cellar in the past. A piece of wall in the passage around the servery was removed in early 2000 and a small counter installed. A small new bar-back has replaced old shelves. A latch door with \u20187\u2019 on it leads into the front bar which is barely altered with a screeded floor, an old continuous fixed bench all around the room with a baffle / draught screen by the original front door, a 1930s brick fireplace, almost inglenook in style and with a log fire. What looks like originally a window is now a tiny counter /hatch and scrubbed tables with drawers add to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTwo other small rooms are retain a historic ambience. The front lounge has \u20181\u2019 on the door, a 1930s brick fireplace and post-war fixed seating and disused front door. Up two steps is the snug, a small room with half-timbered walls, which would have been an over-spill room in the past. The former living room on the rear right, with a latch door, has been converted into a lounge and in a new extension is a dining room. The outside gents' has been converted to the cellar and a new gents' (still outside) built.",

        "Description": "Dating from 1621, this remote hillside pub went through a few ownerships in the early 1950s and a newspaper cutting on the wall dated 1955 details a number of refurbishments to bring the pub 'up to standard'. To the left of the entrance porch is the snug which incorporates a former pantry for making and storing cheese, some remnants of which can still be ascertained. The distinctive bar counter does look like it could date from the 1950s and some of the bar back shelves are of glass which became popular in around 1960. This tiny room has an original stone-flagged floor and a Victorian fireplace.\n\r\nThe middle bar has been enlarged at some time in the past by the removal of a side corridor - you can see the markings in the ceiling. This very small room has a small quarter circle 1950s counter entered via a split door, another stone-flagged floor under the carpet and fine old beams. The rest of the corridor survives and off to its left is a cosy parlour, again with excellent beams but nothing else of note.\n\r\nSteps lead down to the cellar which was the extent of the original building. Then in the late 1960s the cowshed was converted into a dining room and contains nothing of interest. In 2006 it was further extended in conservatory style to double the size of the room. Outside gents' and ladies'. The PVC windows are no doubt very practical in this exposed position but are architecturally unfortunate.",

The right-hand front door opens into the public bar with has a 1920s bar counter, and possibly 1920s bar-back fitting. The right-hand wall has some Jacobean full height panelling which may have come from the previous inn. A short partition creates an area to the left of the public bar door with what may be 1920s fixed seating and a more modern fireplace. On the far left there are two small seating areas - the front one has more fixed seating and a covered up fireplace, and the rear a large 1920s brick fireplace. On the far right of the public bar two doorways lead to a single room with a good wood surround fireplace which may be modern. \r\n\r\nAt the rear right, and possibly in the older part of the building, is a small room with a red and black quarry-tiled floor, a large brick fireplace, fixed seating from the 1920s, and a small bar counter made of barrel staves which would suggest a 1960s build and which may have replaced a former hatch.\r\n\r\nOn the rear left up a short flight of steps is a function room with a parquet floor which may have been extended and had a new bar and bar back in the 1960s .\r\n\r\nThe pub is locally famous for possessing a three-legged chair on which King James I is said to have been seated to sat and watch a cockfight.",

The lobby on the left still has its off-sales hatch but a piece of Victorian bench seating was lost in the flood in 2016. Bar on the left has a screened bar counter with two tiers of stained glasspanels. There was a small draught screen affixed to the counter which was removed about 30 years ago. The walls are half-height panelled, there is an inter-war tiled fireplace, a small piece of old Victorian seating, but the mirrored bar back is modern. \r\n\r\nThe snug has a partition wall on the bar side, an old hatch, old half-height panelled walls, bench seating which could be inter-war and just one table.  At the rear is the lounge with old half-height panelling and an interwar glazed brick and cast-iron fireplace. On the external windows are various inscriptions - one dated 1824. The bar counter and bench seating are recent additions. Beyond is a small dining room on two levels has been brought into use recently.",

The bar fittings probably date from the 1960/70s as does the fixed seating in the front left area. There are three little altered rooms. The front right room is slightly opened-up and retains original fixed seating, Edwardian tiled, cast iron and marble surround fireplace with lovely mirrored surround mantelpiece. \r\n\r\nThe rear right room has a doorway, wood backed old fixed seating and a baffle but has lost its fireplace. The rear left room has a doorway, more original fixed seating, a plain baffle by the door, a large inglenook-style fireplace has lost its fire and there is a hatch to the back of the servery, which looks like a later addition. It still retains its outside gents. Lots of Edwardian cut-glass windows remain.",

There were cupboards where the door to the tap room was.  \r\n\r\nWide doorway on the front left into the dining room where the fixed seating is possibly inter-war, but looks more post-war and there is a 1950/60s stone fireplace. The impressive servery has intact rising panels on the lobby side but has lost all but one in the front bar. The counter top is a copper one all the way around it. Note the 'bar' deep etched panel in a closed position. One door has a 'No 2' deep-etched panel in it. Excellent 'Grimshaw's Ales & Stout', 'Crooked Billet', 'Grimshaw's, and 'Wine & Spirits' windows at the rear. The toilets have been modernised but the passage to gents' has dado tiling and a etched and frosted panel declaring 'food'  in the door from the lobby bar. Ideally we need to see some plans - it maybe that the rear right opening up took place in the 1930s?",

The pub was kept from 1934 to 1976 by Mrs Macluskie and is known locally as 'Ma' Macluskie's. \r\n\r\nThe pub occupies a couple of cottages and used to serve as a hotel for Victorian and early 20th-century tourists. The star feature here is a shuttered servery (cf. the Agricultural Hotel, Penrith) in the main bar. It has three bays and, like the Penrith pub, what is remarkable is that the sliding sashes are still in full working order. How and when they were used in times past is not clear but they were presumably lowered when time was called. It's hard to imagine them being raised and lowered during times of normal service. The bar back fitting was replaced by Thwaites in the late 1990s but the room retains its old fixed seating re-upholstered. The main bar has a Victorian coloured tile floor. That in the main bar is interesting in that it shows how there must have been a screen and door between the entrance and the bar.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the public bar is a room, now an area following the removal of a wall in the late 1990s, that has a Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace. On the walls there was an amazing collection of collages titled 'Eggs of British Birds' in display cases on the wall. Amazingly, these have been restored to the pub and can now be found in the upstairs function room named in honour of Ma' Macluskie. \r\n\r\nBeyond the left hand entrance door with its colourful glass panels is a separate room with a sliding door, old fixed seating re-upholstered and a fireplace. Until its closure there were three ancient cast-iron tables inlaid with tiles - two with 4 pictorial tiles of sailing ships anf the third of flowers - which can now be found in the Morecambe Hotel, Morecambe. On the far left is a games room which was formerly Ma McLusky's living room and has a Victorian coloured tile floor.",

At the rear left is another room with a small piece of old curved fixed seating, old dado panelling but the brick fireplace looks modern. The room on the right on Hollingsworth Street side has more old fixed seating but the room has been opened-up to the lobby and the brick fireplace is modern. Upstairs is a function room with a figure '6' on the door which has a 1960s bar counter and old cast-iron and wood surround fireplace. Note the carved architrave above doorways. A number of holes have been cut into walls and windows added in recent years 'for supervision'.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020.  A refurbishment has recently been carried out which requires a re-assessment.  Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nImposing three-storey pub of red brick and terracotta on a corner site rebuilt around 1900 with good decoration in stone on the ground floor. It retains a largely intact plan of lobby bar and three (originally four) rooms and many original fittings including colourful dado tiling. The entrance lobby on the right has a Victorian tiled dado now painted over in brown and inner twin doors in a floor to ceiling screen. There is a large island bar but it is only some ten or so years old. An open plan on the street side has new fixed seating but old draught screen with a stained glass panel in the top. The dado panelling in the left area is old indicating two rooms at the front in the past - what is a door on the exterior is now a window. \n\n The main left-hand entrance lobby has a Victorian dado tiling (now painted brown) and a twin inner door in a full-height screen. A passage runs to the staircase at the rear and has a dado of colourful Victorian tiling which continues up the stairs. The front left small pool room has a doorway, bare wood floor and retains the original bench seating all around and some bell-pushes, and has a black painted wood surround fireplace (now blocked). \n\n Further down the passage a doorway on the left leads to another small room with fixed seating in four semi-circular bays - two each side - with carved arms, also a good marble surround fireplace with a modern interior. The tiling continues around the walls to the toilets at the rear right and to the right-hand entrance lobby. The front-right small room has a doorway, original fixed seating, a wood-surround fireplace painted black but now blocked. Apart from this room, all others have a decorative cornice. The tiling is in dull yellow and patterned relief tiles in alternate claret and dark green topped by a row of relief tiles with a circular pattern. \n\n Go upstairs and you will find more dado tiling around the walls of the passage throughout the first floor which has a small bar on the left (all modern fittings) and a large function room on the right with a good cornice. Note the dumb waiter with two ropes to move the cage. The tiled dado even continues up the staircase to the second floor. There are good newel posts on the ground and first floors. Toilets on the first floor have 1930s fittings but the tiles have been painted over. There is an active bowling green at the rear.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2020.  Converted into four flats and therefore been re- categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before it closed \n\nAn early 20th century red brick pub retained much from an ornate interior in a lobby bar and four rooms. The star here is the rare if not unique ceramic bar counter front believed to be by Pilkingtons and one of thirteen such ceramic counters remaining in the UK. It has a wooden top but is believed to have been moved within the pub. Behind it are two original bar back fittings topped by broken pediments. The pub is trading as a music venue (Fri, Sat and some Wed & Thu evenings) and in the rear left corner, formerly the kitchen, is a stage.  \n\nFrom the front door is a largish lobby with a colourful dado of floral pattern tiles in green and yellow on a turquoise background and above is a strip of other coloured tiles with cream painted tiles reaching up to the ceiling where there is one row of colourful tiles. The inner door has a star burst symbol in circular panel and in two oval/elliptical side panels and in three panels above. What looks like a former hatch is now a window and may have been an off sales. The tiled dado continues into the lobby bar on the back wall; also in panels on the four sides of the base of two columns that hold up the ceiling; and up the open staircase \u2013 all of the a floral pattern.   \n\nOpened-up to the front right is a largish room with original fixed seating with bell pushes above and a narrow strip of panelling, a fine tiled and wood surround fireplace with bevelled mirror in the mantelpiece and some original etched front windows remain. A door with a star burst etched circular panel in it leads to the rear tight small room with original fixed bench seating all the way around the room, another tiled and wood surround fireplace, bell pushes situated unusually in the top of the seating rather than above it, and a draught screen as you enter.  \n\nIn the rear middle is another splendid small room with a draught screen with damaged leaded panel in the top, fixed seating around most of the room (one wall has none) and bell pushes above also a narrow strip of mahogany panelling. Another tiled and wood surround fireplace, a door with a circular starburst etched panel and there is a piece of part wood \u2018window\u2019 cut out of the upper part of the wall on the lobby side \u2018for supervision\u2019.  \n\nThere is a wide gap into the front left small room which has more original fixed seating and a tiled and wood surround fireplace, two fine draught screens with leaded panels in the top, one wall has lost its fixed seating. Leaded lights in most windows. Opens at 5. \n\nOther Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n\nOther examples can be found at Horse & Jockey, Wednesbury, West Midlands where a small part on the left has been lost;  Castle, Manchester City Centre; Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant",

        "Address": "9 Turton Road, Tottington, BL8 4AW",
        "Description": "Re-built 1904 in brick and stone by the Bury Brewery with an imposing exterior featuring the wording \u201cOld Dungeon Inn\u201d and \u201cBury Brewery Co. Ales And Stout\u201d in stone at the top. The name comes from Tottington's 'Dungeon' - actually a lock up built 1835 and situated just around the corner. The entrance porch, architraves around doorways, the walls going upstairs and around the upper landing, the end of the corridor and the entrance room to the Gents' are tiled in the most magnificent colourful Victorian glazed tiles by Pilkingtons which are in excellent order. The tiles are of the same design as at the Hark to Towler, a stylised sunflower, and the way that they have been placed on the diagonal joins is just brilliant. The upper frieze of fruit and swags was probably designed by A J Kwiatkowski at Pilkingtons. The pub also has faience door surrounds. \r\n\r\nThe inner door is situated in a screen with etched side panels and stained & leaded panels at the top. The bar is situated on the left in what was originally two small room that have been combined with the corridor and the bar fittings are modern, as is the tiled and wood surround fireplace in the rear part but there is some old fixed seating in the front part. \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is the front right snug where all fittings appear to be intact - benches all round, two draught screens, panelling above with bell-pushes, and an unusual old fireplace. The spectacular feature is the area above the picture rail, which has wall paintings highlighted by floodlighting, and is a remarkable feature. An artist, who was living in Tottington as an evacuee, was commissioned to paint the mural/frieze in about 1945. It depicts life in Holcombe and Tottington in the 1940's showing local villages, landscapes and horse racing events. Over the decades, this has become rather brown and it desperately needs some TLC to bring back up to its former glory. The snug is not 100% intact, as there is a rectangular hole in the wall to the corridor.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear right is the games room with original bare fixed seating all around the room but plain windows replaced original etched ones in 2013 as the frames were rotten. The gents at the rear right has plain original wall tiling throughout and old urinals, but there has been some damage to tiling and present landlord hopes to be able to replace them with good replica tiling. The ladies was originally a store room and also has tiling around the doorway. \r\n\r\n Some information from Angela of the Pilkington's Society.",

The lobby bar has a splendid screened servery still complete with lower sections that can be raised and lowered including a curved one.

The left part of the room has a large gap in the wall that separated it from the passage and there is another Victorian-style fireplace, fixed seating but part of a partition wall with a row of glazed panels remain, and another 'Bar Parlour' window. There is a modern hatch/small bar counter added for service to the back of the servery. The ladies' has an old etched panel. Gents' largely old with four big urinals, tiled floor (some new tiles near urinals) and inter-war tiling on the walls.

It is of brick with some stone-mullioned windows and \u2018Brewers' Tudor\u2019 first floor. The entrance leads into a large drinking lobby with ornate sash-window screening to the servery (note the swirling decoration in the glass). There are three narrow bays on the entrance passage side, wider corner bay and very wide bays at the rear - all retain their rising panels which are permanently open. Note the row of carved blue bells in the wood between the bays. The entrance lobby has a door on the right with attractively detailed woodwork that once led to the off-sales (removed when a replacement bar-back fitting added). A lounge on the rear right in an extension is opened-up to the lobby bar and has good quality (date?) fixed seating. Open staircase.\n\r\nThere is a separate snug on the front left with old/original fixed seating with mahogany draught screens at the end near the door having frosted starburst feature; also a good carved wood surround fireplace featuring two columns and bell-pushes. The vault on the right has a lino floor, another two sections of screened servery with one for service and the other an entrance to the servery for staff but does have a flap across it for service. Both bays have intact rising panes in the open position. The fixed seating is modernised but the old mahogany draught screens with glazed starburst feature remain. The short passage between the vault and the lobby bar has one wall with an inter-war tiled dado (but painted over). The brass panel is one of about sixty WWII war memorials in pubs around the country. Function room upstairs.",

        "Description": "The Duke of Wellington is well worth a visit to see the splendid baronial-style lounge which is largely intact from its creation in the 1930s. It lies through a doorway to the right of the public bar and it is entered between two fine timber and glass screens. All around the room are benches with bench ends featuring barley-twist columns and some old panelling above. The room appears to have completely panelled walls but actually the top section is a clever design consisting of strips of timber on plaster walls that have been painted brown. Over the \u2018panelling' either side of the fireplace is what looks like inglenook-style canopies. What seems to be a plaster frieze with decoration of fruits and leaves is actually a plastic mould - just tap it and you realise it is hollow!\n\r\nThere is a fine plasterwork ceiling, and a 1930s timber fireplace with ornate canopy-style mantelpiece which, unfortunately, has a reproduction Victorian-style fireplace. The original stained glass windows remain at the rear but those at the front have nearly all been replaced with plain windows. The light fittings are recent and rather over the top while the carpet is truly horrid but perhaps protects something interesting. Recently a TV screen was bolted onto the panelling but they're relatively unobtrusive and could easily be removed.",

In the front middle right a doorway leads to a small original parquet floor room with what looks like old/original fixed seating (but this is a Samuels Smith's pub!), a cast iron fireplace looks modern but the tiles on the floor and the wood surround aloof old; it has replacement 'Bridge Inn' etched windows.\n\r\nOn the front left a doorway leads to a small room with carpet on a screeded floor, what looks like old/original fixed seating (but this is a Samuels Smiths pub!), the wood surround and cast-iron fireplace is a recent addition but the brick shaped floor tiles and wooden border do look old and there are modern bell-pushes. The rear left small room also has a doorway, old/original fixed seating re-upholstered, a hatch to the side of the servery which looks more modern than old, new bell-pushes, and has lost its fireplace. On the front far right a doorway leads to a small room which has been brought into pub use with no fixed seating but original 'Bridge Inn' window, old cupboards in the corner, and no sign of a fireplace.

It has a four rooms and also a further room upstairs and it very little altered with only the off-sales removed \u2013 it looks like it may have been replaced by a disabled toilet?  \r\n\r\nThe entrance on Kingsway retains its original revolving door and mosaic floor. It leads to a large lobby bar with parquet floor, plain skylight, original fixed seating at the front on either side of the revolving door. The bar counter is the original with a distinct mainly horizontal panelled front, a top that has been replaced at some time, and the original 1938 bar back fitting with etched and frosted glass panels.

There is an odd space on the left hand wall with no fixed seating and now contains a radiator - there was a dart board here in the past. There is a disused door on the Milnrow Road side which leads to a passage with mosaic floor, then a parquet floor.  \r\n\r\nOff the passage the rear right room has a \u2018Public Bar\u2019 in an etched and frosted panel in the door, a parquet floor, original fixed seating, a tiled and wood surround fireplace, a small original bar counter with vertical panels, the bar back fitting looks like the original - the mirrored section at the top certainly does \u2013 but it is not in use.

The right hand door leads to a passage with mosaic floor as your enter and in this area is a disabled toilet with a \u2018Disabled Ladies Toilet\u2019 panel in the style of the original 1938 ones elsewhere. Upstairs there is a function room with a parquet floor and a counter that is similar in style to the others but looks modern;  the bar back fitting is also modern and there is lots of 1930s frosted windows.

It is little changed since a refit just after it became a Robinsons pub in 1926. The restored Huddersfield Narrow canal runs along the rear of the property. From the panelled inner porch and through a door with stained glass panels is the drinking lobby with an untouched servery in the rear left corner. There is a oak panelled counter, a bevelled mirrored bar back fitting with the only change is the loss of a few shelves for a fridge, and a split door for staff access which has a leaded panel. This lobby area has inter-war panelling to picture frame height, a door at the rear has a 'Private' colourful stained glass panel at the top, and panelling continues up the open staircase.  \r\n\r\nOn the front left is a small area which was originally the tap room but it has lost a small piece of wall that separated it from the lobby bar, possibly in the 1960s. It has 1930s or older fixed seating and is served from a hatch to the side of the servery - note the figure '3' on the beam in the lobby bar area. Until 2015 there was a small separate public bar with a figure '2' on the door but the Robinsons tenant took off the door and knocked a large hole in the top part of the wall between the lobby and the public bar. It retains the fixed seating from c.1926 around the room and a stone fireplace from the 1960s. Do visit the gents - locals explain it's the biggest room in the pub! The table and chair in the gents' was put there for a local called Dick who smoked a pipe. Although he died in c.2005 the table still remains. There was no till in the pub until 1998. The car park is across the road.",

The vault in the centre has an old bar counter (painted blue and cream) but the bar back is modern as is the pot shelf. It is opened-up off a passage on the left with a brown and white tiled floor and retains one original etched window. Original central door no longer in use. \nFront left room has a narrow opening from the passageway, bare wooden floor, old fixed bench seating all around the room, an early 20th century tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace and bell-pushes. Further along the passage is a narrow opening to the rear left room with more original fixed bench seating, an early 20th century tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace and bell-pushes in the wood panel above. \r\n\r\nBehind the servery a narrowish gap leads to a slightly larger rear room with a bare wood floor, more old fixed bench seating, two plain baffles by the doorway, a wood surround  with cast iron interior that looks modern but a large plain mirror above which is old. More bell-pushes in the wood panel above the seating. Through a gap from the vault is another bar on the right with modern fittings.",

        "Pub Name": "Griffin",
        "Address": "552 Didsbury Road, Heaton Mersey, SK4 3AJ",
        "Description": "Built in 1831 by the local Thorniley family, it was acquired by Joseph Holts in 1921. CAMRA helped to save the Griffin from demolition in the 1970s. It is well worth a visit to see two ornate shuttered bars - one being a modern copy of the original. On the right-hand side is the old multi-roomed layout including a lobby bar with a splendid carved mahogany screened servery which is complete apart from the removal of the lower sashes that raised and lowered. Off the black and white tiled floor lobby are a small room to the front right with old fixed seating and a Victorian (style?) fireplace; a room on the left with lovely fixed seating and an early 20th-century brown-glazed brick and wood surround fireplace; a tiny narrow room on the right which looks like a conversion of a passage; another small room at the rear right with a marble fireplace and old fixed seating, but opened-up to the lobby; and an area behind the servery with more good fixed seating. \r\n\r\nWhen Holts decided to extend the pub in the 1970s they created an open-plan bar of three areas on the left with a servery that is an accurate re-construction of the original one and using the lower sash screens in the upper part. A wide doorway connects the front section to the old part of the pub. Lots of 'Griffin Hotel' etched windows and etched panels throughout, though, no doubt, some are replacements.",

        "Description": "When the Crown was built in 1820 it was set back from the neighbouring buildings because of three poplar trees. These were felled and in 1930 the pub was extended by building forwards to line-up with the adjacent buildings and it retains much from a quality refit of that time in four rooms. It has a plain brick and rendered exterior and until 1963 it was part of the estate of Clarke\u2019s Reddish brewery. The inner front door lobby has tiled walls and floor and sizeable vestibule with lots of frosted and plain panels. A sliding hatch in front of you looks appears to be as if for an off-sales but there is no servery behind it! The small snug on the front right has a door with leaded panels, 1930s fixed seating, bell-pushes, by the door is a draught screen with a leaded panel in the top and a 1930s brick fireplace. Service is from a small bar counter which might be a replacement for a hatch. The gents' here has inter-war tiled walls and two old urinals.  The main bar on the front left has a door with leaded panels, 1930s bar counter, 1930s fixed seating, bell-pushes, a draught screen, 1930s brick fireplace and a skylight with colourful stained glass panels. The bar-back fitting is an island 'gantry' with mirrored panels and topped with an unusual large canopy featuring mirrors set an angle with star burst centrepieces (date?). At the rear is a part-glazed screen that reaches to the ceiling and has two panels removed. Beyond the screen is a passage with new black and white tiled floor leading to the ladies' situated through a cut made in the left-hand wall and has modern tiled walls. The rear left room behind the screen has fixed seating (date?), an old bar counter, two draught screens at the rear with frosted panels in the top but no fireplace; also here is an entrance to the servery with a flap at the other end.  The vault at the rear right, which can still be accessed by a door down the passage on the right of the pub, has an old counter, old fixed seating, a draught screen, old dado panelling but no fireplace. The gents' at the rear is intact with inter-war tiled walls and three old urinals. Open 2 to 11 Mon to Fri.",

It was refitted in the 1930s and the three room and lobby bar layout remains but was subject to a careful extension in 1999. This saw the rear left room almost doubled in size and the toilets brought inside. From the front door a panelled passage leads to the lobby bar on the right which retains its 1930s bar counter and bar-back fitting, but has a new tiled floor. On the front right a doorway with the figure '1' leads to a very small room with original fixed seating, a draught screen by the door, and a hatch was added in 1999.\n\r\nOn the front left a doorway with the figure '2' leads to a small room with 1930s fixed seating with bell pushes all around that until c.2008 were in working order and not too many years ago they were actually responded to! The rear right room was originally just half its present size with fixed seating but was extended back in 1999 by absorbing a private room. Note the leaded rear windows were the external ones prior to 1999. An extension to bring the toilets inside was added then.",

        "Description": "Old-fashioned Cheshire farmhouse pub of mellow red brick, creeper covered, and with a number of outbuildings on the left. Acquired by Robinson\u2019s in the 1920s, it is attached to a 40 acres of grazing farmland and has been run by four successive generations of the Hallworth family for 80 years \u2013 the anniversary being in February 2012. The family ran a riding school from the stables in the 1940s and diary farming was carried out until the middle of the 1970s. It is better known to many by its previous name the \u2018The Thief\u2019s Neck\u2019 as the tree outside the pub was used to hang wrongdoers in the distant past! The layout consists of a panelled passage across the front of the building between a tap room on the left and a snug on the right; also the main bar at the rear with a small lounge area to the rear right and it has not changed since a refurbishment in the 1950s.  \r\n\r\nOn the front right is a door with the figure \u20181\u2019 on a brown button which leads to a cosy snug which has a draught screen with a stained and leaded panel in the top part, and old fixed seating around the room. This small room has an early 20th century tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace, some half timbering on the walls, a small piece of inter-war dado panelling and a collection of plates and water jugs on a high shelf round the room. The front left small tap room has a modern door, old draught screen, old fixed seating around the room, early 20th century tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace, and some dado fielded panelling.  \r\n\r\nThe main bar at the rear left looks like it was refitted (or created?) in the 1950s with its sloping bar counter and bar back fitting with some glass shelves \u2013 former landlady June Hallworth came to the pub in 1957 and the only change since then has been the addition of the feature above the counter that has reduced the ceiling height above the servery. This area is popular for vertical drinking with only the odd stool. There was a hatch in the back of the servery to serve the two small front rooms.  \r\n\r\nOn the rear right is an area that was until the 1950s a private room and has a good tiled and wood surround fireplace from xxx and fixed seating that looks post war in style. A wooden aircraft propeller suspended from the archway leading to it is a reminder of Woodford\u2019s long association with aircraft manufacturing as the factory down the road in the past produced the famous Lancaster and Vulcan bombers. The outside gents were modernised in the past few years and now there is a covered walkway to them.",

Has a layout similar to the Stork and the Lion, but much plainer. The bare boarded vault and servery are separated from the other parts by an L-shaped corridor. The bar on the corner is dominated by a spectacular mirrored bar-back with carved pillars and decorative capitals, with a central pediment with carved wood decoration and clock; what makes it particularly special is a glazed gold-coloured fascia, starting on the left-hand wall and running along the bar-back, with decoration and elaborate lettering which reads: 'D.HIGSON. WINE MERCHANT & SPIRIT MERCHANT.' (on the return) and 'BREWER. CHEAPSIDE BREWERY. LIVERPOOL' on the bar back fitting. Higsons occupied the Cheapside site until 1912. Having a fitting under which customers can walk is a very rare feature in a pub. There is also a massive original bar counter with match strikers on the bar front and an original water tap on the left end of the bar counter top. There is some original fixed seating on the front wall side. The corner entrance is now blocked up and there was a small snug on the right now combined with the public bar - look for the markings on the counter to indicate where the partition was situated until removed in the 1970s. \r\n\r\nTo the left of the servery is large room (now used for pool) which has the kind of wide opening that characterises other Merseyside pubs (e.g. Primrose, Liscard; Guest House, Southport; and Volunteer Canteen, Waterloo). This room retains original Victorian benches all round with carved bench ends, bell pushes in a wood panel above but the brick and part marble fireplace is more recent. The rear passage has a small square hatch, and off the corridor at the back is a separate snug with original Victorian benches all round. Pub is getting a bit scruffy and would benefit from some attention.",

There is a bar-back-like feature facing the servery which may indicate the original position of the servery but locals say it was at the rear? \r\n\r\nThe pretty friezes in both rooms, at least, are original, but the Victorian-style fireplace in the rear room is also an import. The fixed seating and short partitions/baffle date back to the 1920s. Note how the front room floor slopes towards the street - there is a drop of some 4 feet from back room to front door - it seems that those building the pub simply followed the lie of the land.

A disused door on the right of the vestibule is possibly the original door to the public bar and a partition that separated it from the passage has been lost. (Or it could have been an off-sales as there is a disused door on the right that may have been the public bar entrance). The public bar retains its original counter, but has a new bar-back, new bar top and new pot shelf. It has interwar panelled walls but the seating appears post-war. The inner door has a letter 'B' on the inside and there is a letter 'C' over the doorway to the lounge on the left - these were a requirement of the licensing magistrates but are unusual for being letters, not numbers. \r\n\r\nOff to the left and entered through a wide opening is the lounge with on either side baffles having 1930s leaded glass panels in the top. This largish room has a 1930s brick fireplace, 1930s fixed seating re-leatheretted with bell pushes all around in the wood panel above. Note the detail of the upper parts of the screen separating the room from the passage are repeated elsewhere in the main area of the pub \u2013 hence suggests a unified scheme. Mary Egerton, born in Ireland in 1863 took over the Eagle Hotel, as it was known. She encouraged the stars from the nearby Empire Theatre and on the walls of the lounge are many autographed images of legendary figures of stage and screen. \r\n\r\nRefurbishment 2012 saw the removal of the interwar brick fireplace, replaced with a reproduction Victorian one and the fixed seating was re-leatheretted. The pub advertises itself as 'Ma Egerton's Stage Door as the Empire Theatre is next door - they also state 'Pre & Post Theatre drinks but no orders are taken for 'interval drinks'.",

        "Description": "The fa\u00e7ade bears two dates, 1675 and 1887, the latter indicating a Victorian rebuilding. The great tragedy is that that the pub was opened in 1975;\u00a0before\u00a0then this ornately decorated pub had no less than five separate bars / areas. Although opened-up, it is worth a visit for the quality of what remains - the least-altered parts being the two rear areas which have oblong skylights. All the walls are covered by one of the finest display of Victorian glasswork as can be found in any pub in the country. The walls are lined with glittering mirrors and other screenwork also has fine embossed glass. The glasswork which formed the screens between the different areas was put around the walls in 1975. On the rear right is an original partition dividing it from the rear left area with lots of mirrors in panelling, old fixed seating and an old marble fireplace with modern Victorian-style interior. The rear left area retains original fixed seating, mirrors, and a dado of light brown and other Victorian tiling.\n\r\nIn the rest of the open plan pub is a Victorian semi-circular bar counter and bar-back but these replaced the original fittings in 1975\u00a0having been imported from another pub. The original bar was ceramic-fronted one between two doors, one of which led to the public bar and the other to a lobby bar leading into the back areas. Note some tiling covered by a food bar. There is a dado tiled passageway behind behind the seating areas on the left. In the front section is a fine cupola with grapes and vines decoration and a very ornate plasterwork ceiling. Note how the partition at the front left sits awkwardly compared to the ceiling, indicating it has been pre-sited. Fixed seating beyond the partition is old, but that in the front left area is modern. Fixed seating in the front right section is old but dado tiling is modern.",

Perhaps the most impressive feature is the window glass which is both embossed and curved \u2013 an impressive feat of glass making. Copper straps across the middle advertising Walkers of Warrington. The right-hand strap indicates the buffet for the hotel and this area, as the most prestigious, has a good display of panelling and mirrorwork. This area was originally separated from a large lounge and beyond this was a further, separate public bar. There is some remarkable glazing over two doorways and at the rear of the former buffet.",

        "Description": "Ye Cracke has a delightful collection of rooms, having expanded piecemeal into two houses over the past century. It was the Ruthin Castle and only nicknamed Ye Cracke. Note the unusual tiling outside on the frontage and old 'Marstons Ales' and 'Bass' illuminated hanging signs. The original part consisted of three rooms on the right - the small front bar, the War Office, and what is now the main bar was originally the lounge. There were changes in the late 1960s/early 1970s. The small front public bar has a servery that takes up a large portion of the space and has a plain boarded counter front and copper top possibly on the original counter.  \r\n\r\nAcross a corridor that runs the length of the pub is a snug which goes under the splendid name of \u2018The War Office\u2019 (as the glass over its entrance proclaims). This snug is divided off from the rest by a timber and glass screen and is unchanged with its old fixed seating. The name arose, it is said, because room was the scene of discussions among the locals about the progress (or otherwise) of the Boer War (1899-1902). The window at the rear of the War Office marks the back of the pub before the addition of the rear extension. Two hatches to the servery in the corridor \u2013 one large and glazed, the other tiny and open. There was a corner bar in the lounge (now the main bar) which was removed in the late 1960s/early 1970s and the present large old-looking bar counter was installed then. The far left room has no old fittings. It is said John Lennon drank here when a student at the nearby Liverpool Art College.",

Door at the rear leads to passage with inter-war dado tiling and floor tiles. Wide opening to rear snug with original 1930s fixed seating, bell pushes and 1930s wood surround fireplace with bevelled mirror in the overmantel but a Victorian-style tiled, cast-iron interior added but is old. Wide opening with decorative brackets to the left room with original fixed seating all around. A very good fireplace but it is a reproduction Victorian one with a mirror in the overmantel. \n\nBell pushes all around the room, two good draught screens at end of seating near entrance.

The public bar has a tiled dado with tiled panels partly covered by bench seating. The bar counter looks like it dates from the 1950s and has recently been painted maroon. Half of the bar counter top is of Carrara Marble. The dado panelling is modern covering a painted dado. Originally there was a snug at the front, left of the vestibule. Across the corridor two rooms seem to have been amalgamated into one. The front parlour has some old fixed seating with bell pushes and short screens, a Victorian tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace that may be an import and the low baffles are all modern copies. The rear news room has fixed seating that has fixed seating may be old, bell pushes, the baffles look old but only one from the passage is original with three others modern copies.

Two rooms - the front one containing the servery and a smaller snug behind. The old bar counter came from a pub in St Helens in about 1988, the bar-back and all the screens are new. Two vestibule entrances have old etched glass panels and the fixed seating in its own semi-screened-off area appears genuinely Victorian.

Superb Bass mirror in rear room (recently smashed) (signed J. R. Dunning & Son of London) was brought in c.1988 when a sloping wall at the back was converted to a straight wall! The back room of the White Star was used by Bob Wooler and Alan Williams to pay all of their groups including the Beatles and a brass plaque indicates where John, George, Paul and Ringo were paid! - the famous Cavern Club was situated in nearby Matthew Street. Under the liner sign is the original mosaic sign of a White eight pointed star.

This is a fine pub and one to compare with other excellent Heritage pubs on Merseyside - the Stork; in Birkenhead, the Lion; and Prince Arthur; in Liverpool with an L-shaped corridor surrounding the public bar and rooms leading off the other side of the corridor. A difference from the Lion is that there is no glazing between the lower parts of the screen and the ceiling.  \r\n\r\nVestibule entrances on the left and right with part glazed partitions/screens reaching to the ceiling. A few tiles from the c.1900 refitting are visible but most have been boarded over, probably in the 1930s when Victorian and Edwardian work was deeply unfashionable. In the public bar the pot-shelf is modern. The lobby bar back has two narrow bays with rising lower windows firmly fixed in the open position these days with an arch over the hatch for service; then two wide bays with the first one permanently in the down position and the second one is permanently open i.e. is a hatch for service. The two narrow sections on the corner have lost their lower rising panels; then there is a doorway and arch for service; and another two narrow bays - first is open for service and the second is permanently closed.  \r\n\r\nNear the corner door is an unusual piece of bar which has a radiator on either side which has been cut down in size and this is all that remains of the former off-sales area. The L-shaped bar has a wood-block floor, dado panelling around the walls which, locals say, covers the original tiled dado, a side window has a window screen of one main decorated etched and frosted large and two smaller panels and the front window has two similar window screens.  \r\n\r\nLobby on the left has a dado of tiling. This lobby goes around the bar to the right and has fielded panelling to two-thirds height on the left and rear wall. 'Gentlemen' in gold on decorated etched and frosted window in the door to toilets. On the left is the Blue Room with doorway and fixed bench seating all around with new bell pushes in the wood panel above - this room did advertise 'Waitress service available at your table' until a few years ago.  \r\n\r\nIn the porch on Jubilee Street side is tiling to dado height, a door with good centre circular 'Walker's' decorated etched and frosted panel and four others, 'Public Bar' in gold on door to the left, a decorated etched and frosted 'News Room' in gold on the inner door. The large rear room was the result of an extension to a smaller one, probably in the 1960s and has some fixed seating at the front that looks to date from c.1900 with the rear section being modern.",

Note a good display of etched glass \u2013 the name of Higsons the brewers in the front windows and the names of rooms in several other windows. The public bar and snug are excellent intact survivals. Front right entrance leads into a vestibule with both etched and frosted and stained and leaded panels and a 'Snug' etched and frosted panel in the door. The door from the left of the vestibule originally led into the off sales - the ceiling indicates where the partitions were originally so the hatch on the front was the off sales one. The snug is entered from the right-hand doorway and is an intimate, L-shaped space with 'Higsons Genuine Ales' exterior windows. It has an Edwardian bar counter with match striker and over it a screen containing both etched and frosted panels left and right, and three stained and leaded ones above an arch shaped opening for services similar to that at the Prince Arthur. The snug has old dado panelling but locals say the fixed seating was added in recent times, and there is a 'Snug' etched and frosted panel in the rear door.  \r\n\r\nA part-glazed partition separates the snug from the public bar on the front left. The screen has both decoratively etched and frosted panels and stained ones above. There is another smaller opening in the screen on the street side. The public bar has a 'Bar' in the vestibule door and the one from the passage at the rear. It retains the original counter (but modern pot shelf) and fixed seating, an 'Higsons Genuine Ales' exterior window.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear a passage ran all the way along and in the 1970s a partition was removed to open-up the two rear small rooms to the passageway. There is old fixed seating in both areas and a Victorian-style fireplace in the right hand area. The rear right room operated as a 'Men Only' space prior to the 1970s and the left hand room was used by women. Down the left side of the pub are both 'Parlour' and 'Lounge' etched and frosted exterior windows - in this part of the country 'Parlour' is the local word for 'Lounge'. The present glass and woodwork over the corridor is modern work. Service to the rear rooms is from a doorway and flap to the back of the servery. In this pub you can still get table service in the rear right lounge most days, but not when busy, particularly not on Fri and Sat - only a handful of pubs still do this regularly including the nearby Volunteer Canteen, Waterloo.  \r\n\r\nThis is one of the last pubs using a filtration system to return beer to the cask. Using tight sparklers means that froth as a glass is filled runs into a deep tray - separate ones for each beer. Every hour or so beer is carefully placed into marked and clean stained steel buckets and put back into the cask using a filter. This system has been in operation here for many years. The outside gents is still in use.",

The original and notable seven-bay bar back has extensions beyond the bar counter to allow for door to rear corridor at left and passage to rear corridor porch at right. The bar-back is glazed to allow for borrowed light in rear corridor with the exception of one bay which has been replaced, crudely, with plywood. In contrast to many other pubs the bottom part of the bar back has been retained and modern fridges etc are sensibly accommodated under the bar counter.  \r\n\r\nBehind this is a central passage with a floor of the corridor of floor tiles with blue five-sided tessellations, which have been repaired in places. The rear corridor is lit by electric light and borrowed light from the bar and there is a tiling up to a dado rail of cream and blue tiles with a central tulip motif, The tiling is repeated on the exterior walls of the public bar. There is a serving hatch to the back of servery opposite the doorway to a large room with an early 20th-century tiled fireplace.  \r\n\r\nAt the right hand end of the pub is a large porch area some of which has been incorporated by new screen-work in the style of the old (pity the work does not seem to have been finished off \u2013 the wood is untreated) into a back room where a dividing wall with a double door has been removed. The front part of the porch, presently being used for storage has also has a tiled dado and a tessellated tile floor. The right hand side room and\u00a0the front part of the back room have a tessellated floor below a skylight dome, currently not lit. The back part of the back room, formerly the lounge, is now used as a breakfast room by guests in the thirteen letting bedrooms and has a fine, original very ornate fireplace. This plan closely resembles that at the Royal, Wavertree.",

Look for the old mirror attached to the main entrance porch - in olden times customers drinking in the main bar could spot the tram as it came across the bridge over the Manchester Ship Canal and heading for Warrington centre so they could drink up and get to the tram stop across the road in good time! There are stables at the rear. Upstairs room ??

        "Description": "17th-century pub converted from two cottages which were rendered in the 1940s, just after Greenall Whitley took over. It originally consisted of three rooms \u2013 the bar, small snug to the left and the far left lounge. It is not clear how the servery worked originally but it might have been a cellar as there are signs of walls having openings created in them. The snug on the right is of most interest with old fixed seating, good wood surround fireplace in inglenook, old panelling on the exterior wall and service from a hatch to the servery. A door on the left leads to the lounge with a 1930/1950s brick fireplace, mostly full-height panelling which was only exposed recently. Two other small rooms at the rear have been brought into use.",

The vestibule entrance has two doors indicating the bar was two rooms separated by a partition in the past. On the right hand side there is a low screen (with no glass left in it) that separates the bar from the former off-sales (now used as a store). There is the original fixed seating in three sections including some at the rear left, which looks like it could have been a separate room in the past, and has a newish cast fireplace. A passage round the back of the bar leads to the lounge on the right which was two small rooms. It has bar counter and bar back dating from the early 1970s (?) and more old fixed seating.",

The two left hand rooms have been combined with walls removed in c.2006. There is a small section of 1930s fixed seating to the left of the entrance, then more inter-war U-shaped fixed seating. The parquet floor confirms changes to the layout. Another Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace (but must be a later addition). The bar counter could be from the 1930s, the bar back fitting certainly looks like 1930s with some post war changes such as mirror backing. The wall above two sections of fixed seating was removed by Marstons builders on police instructions and the licensee replaced most of it to create two cosy corners.

A doorway leads to the small front left bar with a 1960s lino tiled floor, a bar counter front with barrel staves brass straps and a copper top - a popular early 1960s style. The bar back fitting has a Tudor shaped arch central section and display cases with leaded glass windows which could be from the 1930s? The fixed seating could well be at least 50 years old but the dado panelling could be more modern.  \r\n\r\nFrom the passage a wide gap on the right leads to two small rooms that may have been combined in the 1960s. It has fielded panelling to two-thirds height all around both areas, good fixed seating (dated?), and a small fireplace on the right hand wall. Further down the passageway on the right is a snug with a door, more good fielded panelling to two-thirds height, and what looks like a 1950s radiator.

Front left small room has a doorway, old dado panelling painted black, fixed seating around the room could be inter-war but likely to be post war, small possibly Victorian cast iron fireplace \u2013 next is a passage with a large old plain mirror.  \r\n\r\nOpposite the servery is a door with the figure \u20183\u2019 on it leads to a small room with more possibly inter-war but likely to be post war fixed seating with baffles by the door and another cast iron fireplace that looks old.

Note the \u2018Powder Room\u2019 sign over the door to the ladies. \r\n\r\nIn the main bar the bar counter is of 1930s fielded panelling painted black but the bar top dates from 2009 and most of bar back shelves look old with mirrored back but it is difficult to date. At the rear is a 1930s brick and wood surround fireplace that reaches the ceiling, inter war fixed seating in parts \u2013 one area has old baffles either side \u2013 one very large but not that old, possibly 1960s \u2013 also 1960s timbering on the walls. Look for the \u2018Gentlemen Only\u2019 sign at the rear right of the main room. Door from main bar to the gents\u2019 is in a floor to ceiling part glazed (at top) partition and the gents\u2019 has five large urinals from the 1930s. \r\n\r\nThe bowling green is at the rear of the garden and is still in regular use - Magazine Bowling Club rent it from the Pub Co. The pub is famous for selling a large volume of Draught Bass \u2013 currently 10 x 10 gallon casks a week - and have sediment filters on the cask end of the line and this helps to indicate when a cask is about to end. When pulling the handpump there is a noticeable change in the pressure and this indicates a change of cask is required, which is done immediately, and rather than run beer through they serve it straight-away. So some pints of Bass could be half from the old cask and half from the new!",

        "Description": "Built 1611 of timber-frame with brick infill panels on stone base and with a thatched roof. It is well worth a visit to see the old snug created by settles around a large table situated in front of a large brick fireplace. From the front door there is a passage created by the settles of the snug and on the other side there is an old piece of furniture displaying old bottles. The snug has an entrance gap between an otherwise continuous settle at four different angles. One of the settles has a row of five glazed panels between the top and the ceiling. Another very old settle has a highish back with fielded panelling. One near the window has a lower back. There is a short section between the gap and the fireplace. There are no other fittings of any great age. \r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Makeney, Derbyshire; Malt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Clent, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; and Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nThe main bar has a red tiled floor, a bar counter of large stones with a wooden section on the top which could date from the 1960s as does the bar back with its Formica shelves. A doorway leads to the room on the right also with a red tiled floor, the fixed seating looks post-war, it has a small brick bar and modern stone fireplace with a coal burner. On the far left a door leads to a small room with a range fireplace indicating it has been brought into use as it another small room at the rear with a flagstone floor. An old cattle barn has been converted into the Cowshed Restaurant.",

It is of five bays, with gables to bays one, three and five increasing in size; each has a design which incorporates applied timber framing and barge boards carved with the national flowers of Ireland (shamrocks), Scotland (the thistle) and England (the rose). There is a lantern tower with Gothic windows and a lead dome to bay two. A stone porch sits to bay four with a triangulated pediment displaying the name of the pub and the date. Once multi-roomed, it was opened up into one large room served by a single bar in the later part of the last century - the ceiling plaster indicates the original layout. The mosaic floor is now covered over but is visible at the top of the cellar steps. The main entrance porch incorporates Art-Nouveau style dado tiling, although this has been painted over in brown. To the rear of the bar is the original wooden staircase to the upper floors with substantial square newels, panel balustrading and tiling to the wall, although painted over.  \r\n\r\nThe splendid high ceilinged former billiard room has full height wood panelling to all walls, with a colourful painted plaster frieze above depicting mythical creatures around three sides. The ceiling is plastered with a geometrical pattern, surrounding the rectangular skylight with wooden geometric tracery and stained glass depicting foliage and fish-scale patterns. A fine fielded panelled fireplace sits to the north wall; this incorporates a mirror flanked by Art-Nouveau wooden reliefs, and a marble surround and tiles painted with foliage and butterflies. The grate is original. On the opposite wall there is a recessed niche housing the radiator. There is a wooden window seat to the east. The room is used as a function room and by the local Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes. There are two colourful stained and leaded glass windows in the former billiard room and one at the top of the staircase.",

The left-hand door to the Smoke Room' is not now used. The \u2018Bar\u2019 door is part of a three-sided screen whose upper portion has leaded windows with ornate Art-Nouveau patterning. Inside, the bar and the next-door snug (formerly the smoke room) comprised the original pub part of the building. The bar has lots of superb pine woodwork. The solid panelled bar counter has its original top plus a leaded screen at one end and a hatch at the other. A terrific bar back has a multitude of shelves with mirrors behind. The L-shaped bench seating is un-upholstered whilst the bottom section of the windows sports an attractive leaded design, carried through to the snug. The only significant change is the modern tiled floor. \r\n\r\nIn the snug, there's a baffle next to the external door and sturdy leather-covered bench seating all round with bell-pushes above. The latter still work though the landlord normally keeps them turned off to prevent over-usage by younger visitors. The bell-box is in the bar, above the snug door. The tiled fireplace has an imposing wood over-mantle topped by an operational clock. The wood-block flooring is original. \r\n\r\nPretty dado tiling can be seen in the corridor from the bar to the toilets. \r\n\r\nOn the right is the present lounge bar in two distinct parts \u2013 the right hand end was a tea room when the pub was built and still retains the original green glazed brick, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace with a mirror in the mantelpiece and there are bell pushes around the walls. The doors and bench seating also date from 1911. The small red-tiled area in front of the servery was converted from the domestic kitchen in 1984 - the range came from a demolished house in West Kirby. The two areas were originally separated by a staircase as well as walls. \r\n\r\nThe bar back fitting here which looks very similar to the one in the public bar was actually only introduced in 1984 \u2013 it has come from a pub in Liverpool and owner Ralph Leech found it for sale in a warehouse - he then added the glass panels to it prior to installation.",

From left to right it reads \"INDIA PALE ALES & MILD ALES\", \"LAGER BEER & STOUT\", \"WINES SPIRITS & LIQUEURS\" (also, under the covering signboard it says \"HOWARD ARMS\", \"SIR RICHARD HODGSON'S OLD BREWERY\"). The tiling was covered over when the pub became part of the Carlisle State Management Scheme in 1916 and only revealed again in 1979. \r\n\r\nOn the front right is a small room with a bar counter from 1979 and the rear wall looks like it is the remains of a Victorian bar back fitting. It forms part of an old wooden partition with mirrors in the central section and late-Victorian glazed panels at the top under a canopy. Part of the partition on the right has been removed to give access to the rear room. The wall panelling in the front room is not old. \r\n\r\nThe small rear right room has late-Victorian panelling  to picture-frame height on most of the walls, but changes in the rear right corner where there is no panelling and it has lost its fireplace. However, two old short baffles have survived and the fixed seating looks more 1979 than older. \r\n\r\nThe small front left room has a bare wood floor, but the bar counter and fixed seating look to date from 1979; the fireplace could be an original Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround one. The rear left room is a bit opened-up with more fixed seating from 1979. As you enter there are remnants of the off sales above new dado panelling.",

The core is a lobby bar with a black and white tiled floor and off which three rooms and one area lead. The servery at the rear has a quarter-circle counter which looks old with modern panels on its front. Above are four etched and frosted panels so this may have been a shuttered bar in the past. All four were covered over for many years and re-exposed in 2015 - the third panel is a replacement. The bar back fittings may be old. The wood panelled space at the rear right has been opened up as there is some modern wood block strips indicating there was a wall / partition here originally. This area has lost its fireplace.   \r\n\r\nThere are two rooms at the front and at the rear left is a delightful small snug. The front left-hand room has a widish doorway still with an etched panel above it, old fixed upholstered bench seating all round and a simple fireplace with modern red tile surround. The curved edging to the lobby tiled floor indicates a circular entrance to the room originally. The front right-hand room (used for pool) has a doorway with an etched panel above, fixed slatted wood bench seating (with padded seats), parquet floor but the fireplace appears to have been removed at some stage. \r\n\r\nThe small rear left-hand room has 'Snug' in the top panel in the door, old fixed upholstered bench seating and what appears to be a retro metal surround fireplace.

Above a picture shows its Victorian predecessor. The new pub, built of brick with a rendered upper floor, was very conservative in style. The two bars are rather austere affairs but they do retain a large amount of original fittings, notably the bar-backs and counters. The detailing of the woodwork is very chunky in the supports to the superstructure over the counter in the left-hand bar and the bold ribbing on the right-hand counter. Note the rather delightful sliding door to the rear of the left-hand part of the servery. Some modern change has also taken place, chiefly noticeable in the dado panelling and the loss of an off-sales facing the front entrance.",

        "Address": "56 Whittle Street, Walkden, M28 3WY",
        "Description": "Built in the late 1950s to serve a large new housing estate. It has a most unusual design of a single-storey with a three-storey tower at one end on stilts all of which is of red bricks. This community pub is named after James Brindley, the canal engineer famous for building the nearby Barton Aqueduct which carries the Bridgewater Canal across the River Irwell. When built there was an off-sales shop in the ground floor of the tower part but this closed some time ago (mid 1980s say locals) and is now used for storage. However, the split-level lounge bar and separate public bar survive with little change.  \r\n\r\nThe left hand door leads to a lobby with a cleaners cupboard and double doors leading to the lounge bar \u2013 note the unusual door handles with brass \u2018Pull\u2019 and \u2018Push\u2019 in relief. The bar counter with a panelled front looks the original as does the bar back with mirrored panels and only two fridges have replaced some of the lower shelving. There are two large curved bays of fixed seating and originally a glazed screen used to sit between the two areas. Up three steps is a smaller area with more fixed seating and a cast-iron fence across the divide. Note the very 1960s door with narrow vertical glazed panes. \r\n\r\nThe right hand door is not currently in use but leads to a passage with terrazzo tiled floor and the toilets off. On the rear right is the public bar with another very 1960s door with narrow vertical glazed panes and the figure \u20182\u2019 on it and four steps down. At one end is an inglenook-style fully ply panelled area with wall benches either side of a stone fireplace painted black. Note the inscription above declaring 'Red Rose Stout' with the lettering now painted white - Salford based brewery Groves & Whitnall brewed a Red Rose Stout and could therefore be the builders of the pub. The counter is the original wooden one and the back fitting shelving also dates from c.1960 as might the blue tiles; the large lino tiles on the floor look replacements. There are two sections of original fixed seating and there is a pool table and a number of domino tables.",

The L-shaped servery with its low counter straddling the two brick arches is known from photographs to have been like this by the middle of the twentieth century. But the screen adjacent to the servery with its warped and twisted glazing bars may even go back a couple of centuries (in contrast to the neat modern work parallel to it).",

        "Description": "This pub is included for the original public area that amounts to just a single tiny bar, 5ft x 9ft 6ins, and, as such, it was one of the smallest pubs in all Ireland. It is barely altered but in recent years it has been joined by more rooms including a new bar at the rear and a room on the right converted from living quarters. \r\n\r\nThe pub was first licensed in 1849 and owned by Baron Cushendun who, when he died in 1934, bequeathed the village to the Ulster Land Fund, who later passed it onto the National Trust. \r\n\r\nMary McBride took over in the 1950s and died in 1983 but the bar and Mary continued to be included in Northern Ireland Tourist Board publications well into the 1990's! She never drank herself and would not serve women in the bar. The Trust closed the pub in early 1995 and spent money on the exterior and then looked for tenants to run it and spend up to \u00a3100,000 on the interior and it reopened in 1997. \r\n\r\nThe porch has a modern tiled floor and there is a passageway that runs to the rear. On the left is a latch door that has a painted-out figure \u20181\u2019 and leads into the tiny bar. It has no tables or chairs and just very simple fittings \u2013 a plain bar counter, simple shelving and a basic bench round two walls. The floor tiles and seating are relatively modern. As part of a St Patrick\u2019s Day competition the total number of customers who could be crammed in was found to be 42! \r\n\r\nOn the front right the former parlour has a wood-block floor, an old cast-iron and wood-surround fireplace and is the venue for live music (or karaoke). At the rear left the new bar has a modern flagstone floor and beyond this is a conservatory-style room. Also an upstairs restaurant. The recent changes, although creating a pub of viable size, have taken away much of the overall sense of what a basic, one-room Irish pub was like. Something of that flavour can be recaptured at McKee's in Dungannon in Co. Tyrone. In winter the pub opens at 5pm Mon to Fri.",

There are another four taps which dispensed soft drinks. Wood-panelled ceiling and two rather oriental-looking cast-iron columns supporting the building above. There was, sadly, a thorough-going refurbishment in 1967 when the snugs were removed.",

        "Description": "A former hotel in the centre of this historic town overlooking Strangford Lough. It still retains most of its old layout on the right-hand side with a small public bar (known as 'Gervis's Bar' after a long-serving barman, now retired), a pair of tiny snugs either side of a passage and beyond a larger room. There was a small snug accessed from the staircase in the entrance hall. Other rooms have been brought into service, including those downstairs for a restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe last major changes occurred in the public bar c.1960 when veneered panelling was applied to the tiled counter front thus hiding a row of colourful Victorian tiles: locals say that the lower part of the counter front is covered in mainly plain green tiles. The bar counter top has a noticeable slope. The bar-back shelving is old with one section on the left-hand wall sloping down to the right. This cosy bar has basic furnishings and some unusual arched panelling behind the wall seats. Look for the old bell box on the wall opposite the servery. \r\n\r\nThe tiny snug on the right has bench seating on three sides: there is a small hatch to the servery with a semi-circular shelf in front of it. The snug on the left has benches down both sides of a fixed table above which is a bell-push. Each snug has a three-quarter height screen to the corridor. There are differences in the woodwork between the two snugs: that on the right seems to belong to two phases as close inspection will show. \r\n\r\nA door leads into the rear room which had a refit in c.1960 when some wall bench seating was replaced by the present fixed seating and a new fireplace was added. Note the old bell push with the word 'Service' above on an enamelled plate. At the rear the gents\u2019 toilet has a terrazzo floor and three large Adamsez urinals. The raised area on the left was created after the banning of smoking in pubs in 2007 to give access to the outside smoking area. \r\n\r\nThe small entrance hall has a staircase down to a dining room and new bar. Halfway down was once a small snug, now reduced in size and used for storage. The small dining room on the left  has been brought into use and has a marble surround fireplace Beyond this a small modern snug. Accommodation is now offered by the adjoining Dufferin Arms Coaching Inn, part of which was the Ulster Bank, as still shown on the windows (028 4482 8229).",

        "Description": "A single-room bar that shows so clearly how thousands of many small Irish pubs would have looked and worked. You will easily see a change in design half way along the bar counter: Originally the room was split in two by a partition / screen as the front part of the premises would have served as a grocers while the rear part functioned as a bar. This useful type of institution survives at a few places in the Republic of Ireland but in the north they were abolished in 1923 on the puritanical grounds that they were leading shoppers into disreputable ways! The rear \u2018bar\u2019 section present counter height is the original, but the left hand grocers bar would have been lower and then raised when combined bars became illegal in Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nThe counter itself and the bar-back are Victorian or Edwardian (with a few 1950s embellishment such as ribbed hardboard on and around the bar back fitting and the Formica top on the counter). The seating was revamped in the 1960s but the rear compartment is the reworking of an old snug. On the wall are framed posters of various bottled Guinness \u2013 some relate to the Guinness bottled on these premises \u2013 another is an old one from a bar in Ennistymon, Co. Clare \u2013 on it is a number \u2013 the last 6 digits is actually the date of bottling. Guinness would arrive in pubs in Ireland in 18 gallon casks originally wood until 1963, then aluminium until 1970 \u2013 it was tapped and spiled and as it arrived fresh the bottles were filled and then allowed 10-to 14 days to settle and mature in the bottle. \r\n\r\nNote the tiny hatch from the servery to the corridor behind: this would have also been used by customers drinking in the now little-used rear room and those not wishing to advertise their presence at the pub. Note the three window bell box on the rear wall \u2013there were two more public rooms upstairs, now private quarters. Outside gents (modern), now covered over on the rear right.",

        "Description": "The public bar has an old bar back of five bays and no loss of lower shelves. The sloping bar counter of ply with a wooden top is only 10 years old \u2013 actually two counters with one in front of the old bar back and left one having only some lower shelving behind it. The fixed seating looks to date from the 1960/70s. Look for the old bell box above the window on the Young Street side which still works.\n\r\nBehind the public bar is a small room that was formerly the family kitchen with 1960s fixed seating around a large table. On the right Young Street side is a small room that acted as the ladies snug also with 1960s fixed seating around a round table.\n\r\nUpstairs the lounge is a rare survivor from the early 1960s in three sections being a conversion from living accommodation. The area with the servery has ply panelling to picture frame height. The bar counter has a button leatherette front and Formica top. The back fitting is of shelves, the top ones being of glass with a feature of 3 mirrors on more button leatherette (padding). Through a wide gap with more ply panelling on the walls and above the gap are four classic 1960s fixed seating bays of leatherette \u2013 note the metal leg chairs. Some full height ply panelling on the walls. Doorway to the third area at the front left with more 1960s fixed seating and one wall of ply panelling. There is also a large function room on the far left of the first floor which is still regularly used for parties and live music. There is a separate bell box upstairs for the three areas that was installed in the 1960s.",

        "Description": "Prior to 2003 this was a simple, one-room bar with a red diamond quarry tiled floor and newer ones on the left where the shop counter was situated. There is a 'Gillistown House' frosted and etched front window - note the '1' on the back of the front door - the bar back is a splendid carved and mirrored affair with a ballustrade - the bar counter front was covered up with the original underneath - had some old benches from a bank. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 the  Bar was expanded sensitively by extending to the right by removing a small store room and is now some 25% larger than previously but clever use of old quarry tiles means this is not obvious - there is a tongue 'n' groove ceiling throughout - dado panelling on the left and front is original on the right (store room side) is new. The bar front (possibly inter-war) is now exposed, but has a new bar top; the bar back has some additions e.g. modern finishes to shelving, also one fridge replaces some shelving. \r\n\r\nA door at the rear goes into the  New Bar which was Mrs O'Neil's kitchen and living rooms and still has the old gas fitting hanging from the original tongue 'n' groove ceiling which is now painted yellow.  This small room has reused red diamond quarry tiled floor, a small cast fireplace with a log fire, a small bar counter is new, but the bar back has reputedly been imported from elsewhere, as has the rear stained and leaded window and the wood backed fixed seating is modern. Good to see the original Guinness bottling equipment retained in the back room.",

        "Address": "121 Gallowgate, Aberdeen, AB25 1BU",
        "Description": "The Blue Lamp has a rare virtually intact interior from c.1960 featuring distinct fittings of the time on two floors. A three storey granite building in the same family since 1949 it was refitted in c.1960 and is virtual unchanged since with rooms on two floors. In 1989 the former soap factory built in 1850 to the right was converted into a music (lounge) bar. This led to the only loss of the 1960s fittings when new toilets were installed on the ground floor. Front door leads into a small carpeted lobby and on the right is a staircase to the first floor lounge. The interior door ahead is one of many in a very 1960s style with a couple of vertical glass panels and leads to the U-shaped public bar. \r\n\r\nThe servery is in the right part of the U with a lino floor and has a ply panelled bar front with a black Formica top that extends over the top part of the front. The gantry consists of glass shelves on a mirror back. The left and rear walls have floor to ceiling ply panelling and only some bar stools here, no tables so mainly stand-up drinking. On the left as you enter the public bar there are two door-width gaps with a ply covered square pillar between them leading to the carpeted floor seating area in this part of the U shaped room. Around most of the room the walls have floor to ceiling ply panelling. Typical 1960s red padded leatherette fixed seating runs all around the room. At the front left is a dart area (?) and on the bench end here are vertical wooden slats reaching to the ceiling. \r\n\r\nThe lounge is on the first floor and has more 1960s doors and a carpeted floor. On the far wall the wall is covered in panelling laid horizontally. The servery is in the rear left area which has floor to ceiling wooden struts as a wall on the right hand side, Another very 1960s feature is the false ceiling over the servery which is of strips of wood laid vertically and horizontally with a mesh within the squares. There is a bar counter with a plain ply frontage and cream Formica top; the gantry is of glass shelves on a mirror backing, the main shelf is of Formica, and lower shelving is almost intact with only one fridge. Around the room is blue leatherette padded fixed seating \u2013 very 1960s. The gents\u2019 and ladies on this floor are unchanged.  The lounge is available for private functions and occasional music performances. \r\n\r\nThere is a separate entrance to the popular music venue on the right which hosts the Aberdeen Jazz Festival each March. Through a revolving door is a large room with modern but good quality fittings including a three bay bar back and modern dado panelling, also a stage. The local folk club meet here on a Wednesday night, jazz on some Thursdays, and there are usually bands (rock, blues, folk-rock) playing on Friday & Saturday nights at which there may be a charge for admission. This is one of few pubs still selling (one) real ale from a fount. Opens at 4pm (2pm Sun) - opens at 12 if Aberdeen are playing at home. The music lounge hosts Jazz on Thu, music most Fridays, and comedy on Sat.",

A small sitting room was lost in the 1960s by the removal of a short glazed partition on the left. The pub is very busy when football is screened.",

Grade C listed in 2008 as part of the Historic Scotland Public Houses Thematic Study, it is sad to report that in 2020 Scottish Borders Council agreed to the owners request to remove the wall that separated the public bar on the right from the smoke room on the left. The Council insisted on the retention of the small lobby and its inner doors with etched glass bearing words 'Bar' (right) and 'Smoke Room' (left). \r\n\r\nThe left hand smoke room was originally served by a hatch, which was replaced by a small counter in 1990. On the right hand bar side the 1910 panelled counter abutted the wall \u2013 the position of the removed wall can be easily spotted by looking at the ceiling. In 2020 the counter in the right hand \u2018bar\u2019 side was carefully extended to the left by about a third in the now combined room to make it look like the whole counter dates from 1910. You need to look very carefully to spot the changes. The counter front has been painted in a light rust colour and the 1910 counter top on the right hand side has been saved at the insistence of the licensee and the left hand section created so as to not make it obvious that it is modern. \r\n\r\nThe fine 1910 three bay gantry remains with its integral clock and three etched mirrors partially covered by shelves held up by slender columns; the detail on the central one is of crossed brooms (besoms) and thistles. Changes were proposed to the shelving but this was also stopped by the licensee. The bar side has some old dado paneling painted a grey colour and a wood surround fireplace with a modern interior. \r\n\r\nThe pub was extended to the rear in 1954, and through a wooden archway on the rear left is a room with full-height ply panelling, a number of bell-pushes around it, and Coldstream Guards memorabilia, including a visitor\u2019s book. \r\n\r\nTo the right though a two-leaf door there is a small separate room brought into use as a pool room in recent times, it is now a dining room with a wood laminate floor and a brick fireplace of no great age.",

The panelled walls are original, as are the Victorian tiled fireplace and the bench seating opposite, but the island gantry was replaced in 2003 and other seating renewed. Other original features include a large frieze of Fleur-de-lys and thistles all around the room, two large Geo.

The idea was to control the consumption of alcohol by workers in the munitions factories at Gretna and, under the scheme, the Blue Bell was refitted and is not much changed since. This former coaching inn, where Hans Christian Anderson is said to have stayed, dates back to 1770, but the red sandstone building is now mainly mid 19th-century, although it still retains its stables at the rear. The main change in the last 50 years has been the removal of a sliding screen on the left of the entrance which  gives the pub an open-plan feel. All the walls are covered in inter-war panelling, as is the bar counter, but the counter top and back gantry have been replaced in the past 30-odd years. There was a tiny snug on the right-hand side until the 1970s. The gents' is intact with its panelled ante-room, tiled inner room and original Shanks urinals.",

If you sit in it local custom states that you have to recite one of is poem's or your forfeit is to buy everyone in the pub a drink! \r\n\r\nThe Burns bedroom upstairs has etchings on two windowpanes that have been authenticated as being written by Burns. If you want to find out more about Burns visit the nearby Robert Burns House, which is on the way to the Ship Inn.",

Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description is one written before the recent changes. \n\nSituated opposite St Michael's churchyard, where you will find Burns' mausoleum, is this small three-roomed pub that has been little altered in 40 years. It was converted from an early Victorian house into a two-roomed pub with snugs in c.1900. A vestibule entrance leads into the small public bar, which has an original mirrored back gantry with a modern top section. The original bar counter has a panelled frontage probably added in the 1960s and a new top. Prior to 1960s there was a row of three small snugs down the left side and another on the front right. Horizontal panelled walls probably date from the 1960s.\n\nContinuing to the rear, you will find a lounge with fittings from the late 1960s including panelled walls and fireplace. Both the public bar and lounge retain their highly decorative Victorian plasterwork cornices and ceiling roses. Beyond the gents' is a small panelled room brought into use in recent years. Sadly, the good stained and leaded 'ship' front windows have been lost recently.",

        "Description": "A shadow of its former self is how some local people describe the Diggers, the name coming from its position between two large cemeteries. However the layout of the bar is much as it was. Situated in the ground floor of an 1889 five-storey tenement block, the pub was owned by the T W Innes Trust from 1899 and remained unchanged until purchased by Scottish & Newcastle in the early 1990s. The changes in recent years include the replacement of the bar counter, a new bar top and in 2002 the removal of the partitions that formed the separate jug bar and private bar, as well as the solid wooden screen from the top of the bar counter and a set of three tall fonts. Only the back gantry of sturdy well-carved wood and the small island gantry of oak are original as is the screened Publican\u2019s Offices area created by two low partition walls at the rear. \r\n\r\nAway to the right, separated by a glazed screen, is the small back room with tongue-and-groove timber dado and brass service bells. The pub gets packed for Hearts home matches and rugby matches at nearby Murrayfield. \r\n\r\n It was internationally famous for serving cask McEwan's 80/- or Heavy at lightning speed from 11 tall founts by up to 15 red-jacketed barmen. It is one of only a handful of pubs in the city to have always sold real ale and in the past customers would raise their fingers as they entered the pub to indicate how many pints they wanted which were poured ready by the time they reached the bar. As the then landlord Bill Farmer remarked, \"The person coming into the pub needs a pint more than the person in the bar that's already had a pint!\" It has probably the largest number of working Aitken tall founts (eight) serving cask ales by air pressure generated by two electric air compressors.",

There are still working water taps on the bar that were replaced in the 1980s and some attractive coloured glass advertising various drinks.

It is situated in the base of a four-storey terrace tenement built in circa 1818. It is notable for its impressive Classical style decorative scheme by respected local architect, John M Forrester in 1898-9. The work was commissioned by the trustees of the estate of a Mr Sinclair, a deceased wine and spirit merchant. The pub wraps around a florists shop on the corner and has an attractive ground floor frontage of teak, and above a balustraded, ball-finialled parapet. On the front right-hand side note the wrought iron lifting mechanism used for beer barrels in the past. Now a L-shaped interior, it did originally have a couple of snugs at the rear, and the right-hand front door led to a jug and bottle. The doors on the left and right now lead to a single space with a bare wood floor. In the front bay window there is old fixed seating with leather cushioning, bench ends and a large oval shaped table.  \r\n\r\nThe dado of the L-shaped interior has tiling around most of the walls. It includes 11 tiled paintings showing Scottish rural scenes, nine of them featuring lochs. Many were covered by benches but recently more have been revealed by replacing some benches with chairs so now only a few are hidden. Around the paintings are turquoise tiles, then two narrow strips of light brown and golden yellow embossed tiles separated by an even narrower strip of turquoise tiles. Then larger light brown tiles and full sized cream coloured ones. Among the cream tiles are some brown embossed tiles with a leaf pattern; also some narrow vertical panels of turquoise tiles \u2013 some three tile width, some one, with a narrow strip of golden yellow embossed tiling, another narrow one of brown, and a wider light brown tiles around them. At the bottom are rows of cream, a narrower one of dark brown, and a narrow one of claret. At the top are six vertical strips of tiles in claret, light blue, golden yellow and orange colours including two of embossed tiling topped off at dado rail height by a dark brown ceramic moulding. Above the dado on the left hand wall are two massive ornate mirrors which lean away / angled from the top \u2013 both have the wording \u2018Finest Old Scotch Whiskies Wines & Brandies McLaughlan Bros Proprietors\u2019 \u2013 the left hand one has the Scottish crest of a red lion on a yellow background in the centre and the right hand one has the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom. Around the corner on the wall in the far L-shaped section about the tiled dado is a \u2018William Younger & Co\u2019s India Pale Ale Edinburgh\u2019 mirror.  \r\n\r\nThe ornately timber panelled bar counter of oak from 1899 remains. It curves on both left and right sides with pilasters and quasi-consoles all along it. The ceiling-height 1899 seven bay back gantry of oak has four protruding bays whose top sections are held up by two square pillars at the front and two pilasters at the rear. Bay four is taller with a modern \u2018The Barony Bar\u2019 bevelled mirror in the top part. Bays three and five are topped with ornamental balustrades and ball finials. Bays one and seven are pedimented and have mirrors, ornamental balustrades and ball finials. Bays two and six have oval mirrors backing, detail in the spandrels, and topped with split pediments and ball finials. Good lower shelves intact on the left-hand and right-hand ends and only the central half has then replaced by fridges. On rear wall are two Victorian carved wood surround, cast iron & tiled grates. They both have ornately carved over- mantels with pediment, bevelled mirrors and topped with a ball finial. The compartmented ceiling has a decorative plaster cornice painted gold with egg & dart and foliate mouldings. Regularly spaced along the ceiling are pairs of decorative consoles painted gold.",

A separate snug-sized TV room shows the usual TV sports. \n\nThe former description is shown below.

The entrance leads into a small lobby which, no doubt, used to have a jug bar hatch for service. The U-shaped counter has reeded panelling of the same type that lines the walls. The island gantry looks wholly modern. At the rear right is a sitting (now games) room with plainer dado panelling. The lounge to the left is physically separate and currently closed.",

A door from Gowan Street leads into a passage that has an intact off-sales hatch with its two sliding windows. In the gents toilet the WC did have a working penny in the slot on the door until recently but this now resides on the wall of the lounge upstairs, which has a post-war bar counter, new bar top and new shelves for a gantry.",

Situated in a building dated 1927 it has a U-shaped bar counter and island gantry, which are believed to have come from the original Old Wine Store pub situated 100 yards up the road. The splendid island gantry has four tall upright casks and the third one on the left is still in use and dispenses Whyte & McKay's Blended Whisky. Note the tiny 'Doctor's Special' mirror on the lower end of the gantry and the small till drawer. The pub still retains a working off-sales on the left but the partition that separates it from the bar has been replaced in recent years. On the right side of the room are some new low partitions and fixed seating. Up to 2003 this area consisted of three tiny snugs. The games room at the rear is a conversion of a former ground floor cellar. The ladies' toilet was added in the 1970s.",

A popular drinker's pub, it still has many fittings from c.1900, and is one of a handful with an original horseshoe-shaped counter still with the old terrazzo spittoon trough around the base, which, unusually, has a drain. At the rear right where the terrazzo trough finishes, the counter has been turned through 90 degrees to create more space for customers. \r\n\r\nThe pub retains its original quarry-tiled floor, panelled walls that run all around the room and two Edwardian red-glazed brick and wood surround fireplaces. Note the Art Nouveau stained and leaded panels in the original vestibule entrance around the right-hand door. On the left are two open snugs separated by a modern partition. The upstairs function room has an old crescent-shaped bar counter and a back gantry originally from the Marine Bar in Ayr, which was demolished in the 1990s.",

        "Description": "Built c.1900 pub of red sandstone, this pub originally consisted of the public bar, family department, sitting room on the right and lounge on the left. The public bar still has its original, decoratively carved quarter-circle bar counter and a splendid near full-height, two-sided back gantry made of rosewood. It is pleasing to see that the lower shelves of the gantry remain intact and a new fridge has been placed within the servery instead of replacing shelving, as usually happens. Judging from the photograph taken 70 years ago that hangs in the bar, the only change has been the removal of small spirit casks and the replacement of the clock.  \r\n\r\nPart of the screen that originally separated the family department was removed in the mid 1990s. The high-ceilinged room has a Victorian-tiled fireplace, a good old McEwans mirror, decorative cornice-work and good ceiling roses. Note the unusual resting place for the flap allowing staff access behind the counter. Normally it is lifted up and a catch holds it in place to allow entry but here it drops down and fits into a recess into what looks like a wooden case. On the front right, the small sitting room has some old fixed seating.  \r\n\r\nThe narrow lounge on the left has been refurbished but there is still hatch service. There have been some additions in modern times including a new snug behind the bar and two games rooms at the rear on the right. In c.2009 the small modernised lounge on the left was replaced by an ultra modern Riva Restaurant.",

Back in 1958 there was a snug at the street front which has been removed in recent years and the whole counter moved to the right to meet the window; originally the counter had a side for the snug. \r\n\r\nOn the left side of the public bar are two sitting rooms created by floor to ceiling wooden partition walls with high level glass panels and separated by a passage from the side door. Each snug has a sliding door from the passage, leatherette fixed seating and bell-pushes but the panelling on the walls was renewed in the mid 1990\u2019s. The bells are still working \u2013 one in the passageway is for off sales \u2013 each snug and the passage bells have a different pitch and licensees / staff know which is which and some table service still occurs at least daily.\r\n\r\nAt the rear is an intact lounge created in 1960 from former private accommodation. The lounge has a post-war style bar counter with four ply panels attached, a mirrored gantry at the rear, fixed seating, two tiled fireplaces with timber mantels all of 1960s vintage. \r\n\r\nGents\u2019 looks older than 1960s so possibly former outside ones?

In 1980, the bar was reduced by 2.5 m (8 ft) on either side - a new floor makes it difficult to spot the extent of the bar originally but take a look at the island gantry and you can see how it is curved at the lower shelves level on the right but on the left hand side it finishes abruptly. The inner portion of the vestibule on the right hand side has been lost otherwise the room is largely intact with four cast-iron columns with florid Corinthian capitals supporting the beams for the upper floor. The rear snug and office are no longer in use. The large lounge upstairs was turned into a flat in the mid-1980s.",

A row of snugs across the room from the servery is rare in Scotland but is seen in a number of pubs in Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nThe back gantry, which is modern, and bar counter are arranged on the right-hand side, parallel to the snugs.

The high-ceilinged public bar has original full-height panelled walls and a horseshoe-shaped counter that could be of 1950/60s vintage, both of which have had their dark stain removed in recent years and replaced by a light one. This pub not only has an old carved back gantry but also a modest island gantry, possibly a 1950/60s addition, which is on wheels and has to be moved to gain access to the cellar below. Good 1930s windows including one etched 'Afternoon Teas' and three old window screens - one is in a frame on the wall and another reads 'Breakfast Luncheons High Teas'. Nowadays only crisps and nuts are available! The small pool room has no old fittings.",

The small public bar retains an old gantry with drawers and four whisky mirrors. The bar counter was replaced in the 1960s, as were the fixed seating and brick fireplace, but the panelled walls are old. Markings on the floor show that originally the area behind the bar was actually greater than that for drinkers. The games room on the left has a small bar counter, back gantry and fireplace from the 1960s. On the right are two small rooms brought into use in recent years. The first, Which is the venue for musicians on the first Tuesday in the month, has a 'John Wright & Co's India Pale Ale' mirror. Has an outside gents'.",

The rooms seem to have been mostly refitted in an inter-war scheme with basic, three-quarter-height wall panelling in the public bar on the corner. Formerly two separate rooms until the wall between them was removed in 2006, it retains a 1930s panelled, U-shaped counter, modest island gantry and low window seats. In the small middle lounge the bar counter appears to the only survivor from the 1930s with a gantry and Victorian-style fireplace dating from a late 1980s refit. Carrying on down a passage to the rear and you will find the Reuben Butler lounge, named after the character in Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian. This two-part lounge, which can also be accessed from Kirkgate, is only open in the evenings and at weekends. The counter and stone fireplace could also be from the 1930s but the gantry is more modern.",

The entrance on the left has a curious vestibule-style entrance closely resembling that of a revolving door one with its curved timber partition, and has two exits indicating there may have been some division of the room in the past but there is nothing else to suggest this. \r\n\r\nThe public bar has a bare wood floor, old panelling on the walls to almost 2/3rds height, a panelled bar counter that could date from 1884 and a gantry of similar age with barley twist columns holding up a canopy which is filled with bottles of wine; there is no loss of lower shelves for fridges here. On the left is some old fixed seating that could well date back to 1884 comprising of three bays big enough for two people to sit, but there are markings on the wall of the front section of the room which could indicate removal of some other fixed seating? In the rear left is a fireplace that looks to date from at least the early 20th century with its glazed red brick interior and there are cupboards in the panelling to the left of it. On the rear wall is a floor to ceiling plain mirror that makes the room much bigger than it is and two more plain mirrors above the seating. This small room has a fine boarded ceiling with lattice pattern. \r\n\r\nA door with a lovely colourful stained and leaded panel above (of fruit?) leads to the room on the right now set up as a restaurant. It has a recently laid laminate floor, panelling to 2/3rds height with bell pushes all around the room, another at least early 20th century fireplace with a glazed green brick interior, wood surround with a modest bevelled mirror in wood surround above but the fixed seating here is more recent than other fittings \u2013 possible pre-war or even just post-war? There is a screened-off office in the rear left corner formed by a timber and glass partition that is of a different era to the panelling on the walls and a door at the rear has frosted panel with \u201cPrivate Parlour\u201d etched on it.  This small room also has a high boarded ceiling with lattice pattern, a curious old cabinet high up in the rear right corner, and another large plain mirror on the rear wall above the seating.",

        "Address": "803 Govan Road, Glasgow, Govan, G51 3DJ",
        "Description": "Built 1894 in Scots Baronial style with a tower its first floor was originally the Cardell Hall, named after John Cardell who used it as the local headquarters for the Rechabites, a charitable organisation which espoused the virtues of Temperance. However, by the 1900s, the Temperance Movement was on the wane due to stricter licensing laws and a more enlightened attitude towards strong drink and now it is a public house with bars on two floors. Near the tower's conical roof is a stone plaque which features a shield with the date 1894, two semi-clad men, a crown and a lion; its motto \"Sans peur\" means 'Without fear'. High up on the southern side of the building is a stone carving of the legendary Govan Cat, immortalising one prolific rat-catcher who killed large numbers of rodents which had been brought to Govan on vessels carrying flax for the local weavers. The interior has a public bar and separately screened lounge on the ground floor and a former lounge on the first floor, now only used for functions. \r\n\r\nAll the fittings could date from c.1960 with very little changes since. The ground floor is mostly taken up by the public bar with walls of ply panelling to picture frame height. The bar fittings could well be from c.1960 with a ply and Formica panels island bar counter with four short partitions attached, an island gantry with more ply panelling and a feature above it not dissimilar to that at the Laurieston Bar, and square pegboard panels on the ceiling (painted cream). Fixed bench seating covered in red leatherette in the alcoves as well as in the small sitting room - created by a low partition with a row of ribbed glass windows all along the top, it has a hatch to the servery and still retains its door. There are 4 exterior doors \u2013 one leads to the stairs to the first floor. \r\n\r\nUpstairs is the former lounge, which is now used as a function room. It has c.1960s wood panelled walls, a classic 1960s canted bar counter with a Formica lined section above and with a hooped stool for waiters (others at Steps Bar and Viceroy, both Glasgow) and a Formica top. Has a number of red leatherette fixed seating areas around the room. The mirrored three-bay gantry is of c.1960s. The gents\u2019 are unchanged - they look more 1930s \u2013 but the ladies\u2019 have been modernised. The staircase to the first floor has panelling all the way up with looks to be of c.1960 . \r\n\r\nSome information from \u2018The Glasgow Guide (1999) by David Williams ISBN: 9780862418403.",

It was re-fashioned in 1957 (date on the fireplace) and is a now-rare example of the kind of theming that was then so popular. In this case the theme is rugged stonework. But beware! The only real rocks are around the fireplace. The rest is fake, created by applied concrete, pointed to look convincingly rustic. The \u2018rock\u2019-faced counter also incorporates segments of imitation brass-strapped whisky casks with and the gantry also features similar work. The original lower shelves have been replaced by a fridge and some modern shelves. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a quadrant-shaped screen at the entrance with a Perspex centre amid the \u2018rocks\u2019. The flooring is of terrazzo. In the rear alcove a door leads to the former games room, now a kitchen. Crittall windows, with coloured glass panes, survive. The exposed beams are thought to be original as they extend into the roof space. On the hotel side there is a short passage with dado panelling (again of 1957? and repeated in the hotel reception area) and an arch leading to a small tiny snug. Its hatch to the servery is now blocked. \u2018Cuilfail\u2019 (pronounced \u2018cool-fail\u2019) means \u2018sheltered corner\u2019 in Gaelic.",

The back gantry, which could be of a similar age or even older, consists of two separate fittings \u2013 the left one set back a foot or more further back from the right hand one. They are of identical design \u2013 three bays with mirrored top sections but the left one with a couple of drawers being narrower than the one on the right. The tongue-and-groove wall panelling and panelled ceiling are from Victorian times as is the tiled and cast fireplace with good mirrored mantelpiece. New seating and floor.  \r\n\r\nBehind the servery is what was the snug (now used as the office) with old dado panelling and which still has some old fixed seating. In recent times it was very popular with the occupants of the nearby Linburn Centre for the Scottish War Blinded who were served via the stable door to the back of the servery which has a ledge on it. The passageway near the snug has full height panelled walls and at the end is a door leading to the gents\u2019 with two old frosted glass panels advertising  \u2018Murray's Oatmeal Stout\u2019 and \u2018Murray\u2019s Famous Ales\u2019 and old 'Urinal' enamel plate above. Tongue and groove panelling continues beyond the door.  \r\n\r\nThere was a lounge bar situated above the public bar with access via a staircase where the door to the ladies toilets are on the right. It held about 20 people and had a tiny quarter circle counter but is now used as living accommodation. About 50 years ago the present lounge on the left was created from a former house. The lounge and the function room at the rear are completely modernised. Access to the new lounge is via a passage to the left of the public bar. The public bar is open Mon to Thu 5-11; Fri 3-1am; Sat 11-1am; Sun 12.30-12.",

The semi-circular brick fireplace also dates from the 1940s with wooden seats either side but the carved mantelpiece including a central mirror and carved eagle may be over 250 years old having come from the aforementioned Spottiswood House. The fixed seating dates to the 1940s and there is a display case on the counter.

There is a small lounge / pool room at the rear in a 1960s extension - you will notice the small bar counter is a good copy of the counter in the public bar. There are dining and other rooms in the hotel section to the right. There was a serious fire in c.1970 (poss. 1968) so unlikely there are any other old fittings.",

Presumably the bar counter has been changed and would have been in front of the two left bays originally whereas now it is situated in the front of the two right hand bays only.",

Dado panelling painted red, old tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace, more wall benches at rear look original but other seating is post war. On the wall is a \u2018John Haig Whisky\u2019 mirror. \r\n\r\nThis pub built up a reputation as a folk venue and Billy Connolly, The Clancey Brothers, The Dubliners, The Corries, Gerry Rafety and Barbara Dickson all played here early in their careers.",

        "Address": "6 Duke Street, Brighton, BN1 1AH",
        "Description": "Built 1854. A highly striking tiled frontage in two-tone green tile with Tamplin\u2019s livery and a tiled picture over the front entrance depicting Nelson\u2019s ship. This work probably dates from an Edwardian remodelling (c.1910?) for Tamplins Brighton brewery with which no doubt gives the extensive etched, cut and painted glass in windows, the elegant sloping bar counter with sunken panels and 3 bay mirrored bar-back with 3 shelves and turned balusters, entablature and scrolled pediment to centre with modern clock - most of the top part may be modern? On the left is a good late C19 fireplace with bracketed Ionic columns supporting mantelshelf and overmantel mirror flanked by pilaster-panels with brackets over, and deep pedimented entablature. Early 20th century Lincrusta ceiling. The two sets of doors and 'Private Bar' glass show the public bar would have been two separate drinking areas originally but the partition has been removed. Look for the small pull-up section of wall for cellar deliveries.  \r\n\r\nThrough a modern opening on the right is the former 'Smoke Room' as can be seen from the names on the etched, cut and painted door and window glass - it retains an old small bar counter and the plain cream-tiled fireplace could be from the inter-war period, which is the date of the toilets and match-board panelling. The embossed ceiling and frieze could be Victorian. There is an opening at the back of this into a further room being a former shop. Upstairs is a series of three small room with wide openings between them. Two have small Victorian cast-iron fireplaces. The bar in the third room is modern.",

        "Pub Name": "Pump House",
        "Address": "46 Market Street, Brighton, BN1 1HH",
        "Description": "Late 18th century building in The Lanes with a Regency-style bow windowed frontage, possibly reglazed. The pub originally occupied 46 Market Street (first recorded as such in 1854) and in 1954 was combined with 45 Market Street to the left and a restoration by Kemp Town Brewery created a three small room layout with a central servery (with some modernisation). The restoration was confirmed in a December 1962 article \u201cBy their pubs you shall know them\u201d, by Miriam Maisel who stated that the Pump House was \u201ccompletely restored in 1954\u201d. A 1960 book by Charrington's brewery (who took over the Kemp Town Brewery in 1954) states that the 1954 restoration was undertaken for Forfar's (Owners of 44 Market Street) and the KTB by Rings and Braybons. A refurbishment in the 1980s was mainly confined to creating more trading area at the rear left of the pub so it now has four rooms, and later refurbishments have taken place since, the latest being c2001.\n\r\nThe front left bar has old floor to ceiling fielded panelling in light wood with fluted pilasters and toothed and diamond lozenge decoration. The Charrington book says the wood was taken from the first floor of the building when the pub was refitted in 1954. There is a vestibule into this bar using more of the old panelling seen on the walls. There is a curved bar counter of a distinctive 1950s design and it and the panelling appear in a drawing by Alan Roulstone signed and dated 56 (1956). The bar back fitting appears more modern work and the gantry, with large supporting pillars, over the bar counter is modern. The stone fireplace has 'ME 1766' (Miss Elliiot who bought the building in 1766) inscribed in it but it could date from Edwardian times as it does resemble an Arts and Craft design. There is a fine fireback in the disused hearth. Modern wooden floor.\n\r\nA doorway leads to the front right hand public bar which also has more old floor to ceiling fielded panelling in light wood with fluted pilasters and toothed and diamond lozenge decoration. There is another bar counter identical in design to that in the left hand bar so installed in 1954; the bar back fitting looks to be a mixture of 1950s and more modern work. There is another Tudor-style stone fireplace (also not in current use). Modern wooden floor.\n\r\nAn old door on the rear of the front right bar leads to a passage and the rear right small room which has a radiator grill of a distinct 1950s style. The small curved bar counter is a copy of the 1954 front ones and there is a modern screen on top including a set of three snob screens and a hatch.\n\r\nFrom a doorway at the rear of the front left bar is a room created in the 1980s. It has some floor to ceiling panelling that is a copy of that seen in the two front bars but is less ornate. The curved bar counter closely matches those seen in the front bars but you will notice there are no leaf shaped brackets. It has a Victorian-style fireplace. Upstairs is what is called Miss Elliot\u2019s Dining Room that has modern fittings.",

        "Pub Name": "Cricketers",
        "Address": "15 Black Lion Street, Brighton, BN1 1ND",
        "Description": "The Cricketers is the least altered pub in The Lanes, the collection of late 18th century narrow lanes and alleyways and now popular for their range of shops. This three-storey double bow-fronted Georgian building was a coaching inn - the carriage entrance and former stables have been converted into a drinking area with a modern bar counter. Look for the original securing chain - mentioned in the listing description. There is a now-disused door on the left with fine vestibule which gave access from an alleyway into the hotel accommodation. \r\n\r\nNote the old brass plate of the main doors 'R. W. Pitt, Brandy Merchant' - Robert William Pitt was landlord from the 1880s until he died in 1945 aged 93. He was responsible for the pubs refitting in 1886 of which much survives. There are etched glass, a panelled bar counter divided by thick pilaster, and the bar-back fitting has etched glass and spirit advertising panels in glass at the top of the bar-back. The 'Bonder of Spirits', 'Foreign Brandies' and 'Choice Brands' on the return are all original, but the panel on the right with the 'Cricketers' panel is a modern addition - note how the other sections are behind the counter (which has a notable slope). In this area there was originally a snug but the partition that separated it was removed some time ago.  \r\n\r\nA rectangular opening at the rear of the servery functions as bar counter to the rear lobby where an old pair of timbered archways separate side-by-side snugs. That on the right has an interwar brick fireplace while the older, red tiled fire in the larger left side has a sturdy flecked and fluted marble surround. In 1949 the drinking area here was expanded when a former kitchen was removed. Pity about the addition of pseudo Victorian clutter. An old carved cross-gantry with etched glass and small projecting counter screen have regretfully disappeared from this end of the bar since the 1960s. \r\n\r\nA curving staircase leads to three modernised first-floor function rooms. These include the Greene Room, with a set of exhibits dedicated to Graham Greene, author of Brighton Rock. Other material on view relates to Jack the Ripper (who  it's claimed, would you believe, planned his murders in the pub!). Also up here survives a sturdily segmented Victorian bar counter with raised and fielded panels but with brand new back cabinets. Staff claim the upstairs rooms were bedrooms until recently - if so, the bar counter was imported from elsewhere.",

        "Pub Name": "Colonnade Bar",
        "Address": "10 New Road, Brighton, BN1 1UF",
        "Description": "The Theatre Royal, BrightWebb& Co., on, built in 1807 possibly by Edward Hide or Hides, with 1866 auditorium by C J Phipps, re-fronted c.1894 by C E Clayton when the theatre was extended into 8 & 9 New Road and the Colonnade Bar created; the auditorium was re-decorated in 1926-7 by Sprague and Barton. The green-painted elegant Victorian fa\u00e7ade is recessed under a flattened archway with decorative spandrels and pilasters topped with Corinthian capitals. It has a small timber projecting bay with Victorian deep-etched glass each side and above, and a door in each corner - the left-hand one now disused and the skylights above are inset with deep-etched glass. On each side are colourful tiled panels - each carries a thistle design in turquoise and rust on cream with the centrepiece advertising The COLONNADE HOTEL in the top section with tiles in brown and turquoise below and signed by Webb & Co, 294 Euston Road, London NW. \r\n\r\nThe single-room interior has depth but is narrowed by the Victorian servery down the left-hand side. The padded panels on the front possibly added in the 1960 and brass rails line both top and bottom of the carved counter. The fine carved Victorian three-bay bar back has arched framed mirrors and a small glass panel at the centre painted with a Britannia figure trade mark. Research at the East Sussex Record Office shows that in 1952 the whole floor and joists were removed due to woodworm attack. This necessitated the removal of the counter and back fittings. Both were shortened by about 10ft before their being replaced. It is possible to see where they once extended to as there is cheaper quality arched timber each side, framing a mirror. There was at that time a partition running from the corner of the shortened counter to the still existing portion of partition at the right side door. This created a long Saloon Bar and a smaller Private Bar then entered by the now defunct left door. (Perhaps the most remarkable plans for this bar date from 1936, which proposed a complete refit and re-fronting in a modernist style with neon sign (!), The Colonnade Long Bar. No reason is given for this work not being carried out.) There is a good red decorative plaster ceiling with moulded cornice at the rear and by the entrance door there is a short partition with more etched glass in the top section. Timber dado all round, and along the wall opposite a row of illuminated timber-framed mirrors which make the room appear larger than it is. At the front and back is upholstered bench seating, probably from 1952. There are theatre posters and numerous photos of actors. As a theatre bar interval drinks are ordered and ready for you in the break. \r\n\r\nAt times, such as during matinees,it is possible to wander into the unspoilt Theatre Royal and see the 1894 box office still in use today and its three bars. At the rear of the ground floor is the stalls bar consisting of an 1890s panelled  mahogany bar counter and mirrored shelving. On the first floor late C19 double doors with stained glass panels lead into the larger Royal Circle Lounge Bar which retains the 1890s mahogany panelled counter, mahogany and mirrored shelving with central swans neck pediment and a mahogany fireplace with reeded pilasters. The adjoining Phipps Bar contains a later C19 black marble fireplace with tiled cheeks. There is another bar in the gallery which dates from the 1960 but is not always open.",

The bar counter may have been re-positioned - note how close the fireplace is to it! There are a number of etched windows, some replacements, featuring birds such as swallows and finches. The corner door has 'Public Bar' and 'Bottle & Jug Dept.\" and another set of twin doors has 'Private Bar' panels. There is a 1930s brick fireplace and on the right an office-like structure with 1930s glasswork. There is a separate room at the rear now opened-up. Note the dado of Art Nouveaux Lincrusta.  \r\n\r\nThe Heart and Hand, 75 North Road, on the opposite street corner is notable for the distinctive ground-floor green glazed tiling and leaded windows denoting the now-defunct Portsmouth and Brighton United Breweries. Based in Southsea, Hants, the company added \u2018Brighton\u2019 to its name in February 1928 after acquisition of the Rock brewery here at 61 St. James Street.",

        "Description": "Occupying a landmark position opposite the Clock Tower, the Quadrant was under threat of demolition a few years ago. Saved by its Grade II listing and a local campaign it reopened with its interior thankfully unscathed.  \r\n\r\nThis is a mid 19th century three storey building which was refitted in c.1900 and still retains some fine Victorian fittings. The 'Tom Bovey, Wine & Spirit Importer' exterior signs, however, seem modern: Tom Bovey was the landlord of the Quadrant at the turn of tthge start of the twentieth  century when the lower bar was fitted. This wedge shaped pub has two ground-floor bars on different levels.  \r\n\r\nThe small bare boarded lower bar has a moulded ceiling, panelled semi-circular chunky Victorian bar counter and excellent carved bar back with unusual central arch with scrolled brackets and ornate pediment over, mirror-panels to either side flanked by fluted Ionic columns and mirror-glass to toplights. There is a Victorian glazed brick and wood surround fireplace, also a panelled and bowed screen to the stairs leading to the rear exit in Air Street with a pair of etched glass windows divided by pilasters with Doric capitals, one a replacement. The panelling and fixed seating are not that old. (The change in level - three steep steps - runs through the centre of the servery, resulting in hearty exercise for the bar staff.)  \r\n\r\nThe small bar in the apex has a bar counter that is a post-war copy of the lower bar one and the dado panelling is modern. There is a plain triangular-shaped room upstairs. Watch the vertiginous descent to the gents, hazardous enough when fully sober. Just visible on the right-hand side rounded window to the door facing Boots store is outlined: The Quadrant Saloon Lounge Choice Wines and Spirits Bass\u2019 Pale. The etched and cut glass below features a bird which could be a kingfisher, the motif of Tamplin's brewery.",

The attractive etched windows \u2013 \u2018Smoking Room\u2019, \u2018Wines', 'Spirits\u2019 - each feature a pair of dolphins, the one-time brand and motif of Brighton\u2019s Kemp Town brewery, taken over by Charrington in 1964. Harveys bought it in 1980. There are also 'Public bar' panels in the two central doors. This pub retains the footprint of two small front bars and many of its old fittings with evidence of an inter-war refit.  \r\n\r\nThe former front bars each had their own vestibule entrance and were separated by a rare low partition screen but in 2014 the top section of the partition was removed by Harveys and replaced by glazed panel to ceiling height but even that was removed in a further refit in 2016. The glass panel advertises Kenward & Court Brewers and Bottlers of Hadlow. In recent times changes at this central entrance were to remove the former off-sales and the matching vestibule to that remaining on the far right. The two former bars have an old counter (curved panels look to be of the inter-war period) and very good genuine old bar back shelves, tiered with slender columns. There are rebuffed old floorboards while the embossed wall and ceiling paper is typical of the 1930s. At the left is a Victorian-style tiled and cast-iron fireplace. There are aged half-height dados and old panelling on the walls with benches attached in the right hand bar.  \r\n\r\nDown two steps through an archway at the rear right is a modern bar counter (1970s/1980?). The dado panelling and fixed seating is not easy to date and there is another Victorian-style tiled and cast-iron fireplace. Several years ago a further room was created at the rear. A conservatory was added in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nIn 2016 the pub was extended to the left into two former shops. This area is decorated in a nautical style and is accessed down some steps to the left of front bar. Two new windows have been inserted into the wall between this extension and the wall of the former left hand bar.",

Just inside is a striking six-sided stained glass Art Deco skylight in red, lime and gold. The exterior doors indicate it was built as three separate bars but today there is a long gently curved counter, the two end sections run through the line of original dividing walls.  \r\n\r\nIn the 1960s it would appear that the counters in the public bar on the left and smoke room on the right were moved through 90 degrees and the central bar counter truncated at both ends by some feet - note how the bar fronts are more decorative on the left and right with a plainer panelled central section. The bar back is mostly original apart from the insertion of a window on the right hand side. There are 4 original Art Deco grey marble with good quality wood surrounds fireplaces - three of which have a horse-rider panel in relief. The Art Deco looking banquettes actually date from the 1960s - the original seating ran along the exterior wall and that in the right hand side runs across the original doors into this room.

The gents' toilet on the left retains its original wall tiling, two large urinals and sink, the ladies also retains original tiling. The modernised gents toilet on the right was also used by customers of the Saloon Bar hence the disused exterior door (locals call this the busman's toilet as this was a terminus!)  \r\n\r\nOn the right is a free-standing brick-built function hall with barrel vaulted roof which has lost its folding partition wall that divided it into two equal sized rooms. It retains its original 1930s bar back, the bar counter looks like the original superstructure but was re-ronted in the 1960s and has a modern top. The seating looks 1960s. The front lobby and toilets have terrazzo floor, toilets retain original tiling and sinks, there is a 'Penny in the Slot' on the ladies WC but the partition in the gents is a puzzle - did the ladies and gents change sides in the 1960s? Lots of original doors in Art Deco design with brass handles. There is no obvious signs of an off sales.",

The narrow middle room has fittings from c.1947 - the date on the handpumps - the bar back shelves on fielded panelling could date from c.1947 but two fridges have replaced most of the lower shelving.  Note the small swivel leaded window between the left and middle bars; there is a model railway over the bar counter! It has old dado panelling and the two 'Public Bar' etched windows only date from the early 2000s - note they face inward, not the normal, outward. \r\n\r\nThe left hand bar has fittings from the 1930s - a three sided 1930s counter with a apron of green tiles around it, parquet floor on the staff side, dado panelling looks 1930s. The room was extended to the far left in 1969 and the fireplace in the original part was replaced then It has modern 'Bar Parlour' windows. The right hand bar has an old looking counter but is it? In 1986 the room was extended into a former private room by a wide gap in the wall. Marginal. Near the main entrance between the public bar and the right hand room are a number of doors as there was an off-sales here in the past. Outside gents on the right of the pub.",

        "Description": "Built 1924 as a tearoom and shop selling cigarettes, sweets, minerals and teas, it obtained a licence in 1928. It is of half-timbered Tudor style and was owned by Rock Brewery of Brighton, which was were taken over by Portsmouth United Breweries in 1928 who then became Portsmouth and Brighton United Breweries. It was much altered in 1968 and remains an interesting mixture of 1920s and 1960s work, complete with original Crittall metal windows. The pub is in a 1968 time warp as that was the date the present licensee took over.  \r\n\r\nThe L-shaped lounge was originally three small rooms and has imitation Tudor timbering on the walls. One area, near the toilets, is served from a hatch still retaining its glazed top half door. There is a classic 1920s inglenook fireplace here with fitted seating both sides. The main central section of the lounge has the servery consisting of rounded counter from 1968 with leatherette padded panels and a Formica top; the bar-back fitting with barley twist columns is also from 1968. The third section retains its original dado panelling and a section of fixed seating but has lost its fireplace.  \r\n\r\nThe small public bar retains its 1924 bar counter, bar-back fitting with a bevelled mirror central panel, dado panelling and one section of fixed seating. It has a typical 1960s tiled fireplace and lino floor. There was a small room, originally a shop, on the Steyning Road side. The whole ensemble comes with period display of old plates on a high shelf, old implements/firearms plus a display of model toys. The gents' is fitted with 1960s green tiles, some with flower motifs, whilst the ladies' is identical except for being pink.",

There are cast-iron canopies with stained and leaded glass panels at the top leading to the main hotel entrance and the public bar on the corner, the latter being more modest. The corner entrance has a three-sided vestibule leading to a large room with Lincrusta ceiling, two Tuscan columns painted to represent marble and mahogany dado panelling all around and a large wooden clock. The one big room was created some 30 years ago by combining the public bar and saloon; also the floor of most of the room raised. The stained glass lighting feature in the middle of the room is modern.  \r\n\r\nBy the disused door on the right there is a full height partition of three bays with engraved glass panels with floral designs and plain glass arched panels at the top. This forms a passage to the toilets. The mahogany bar back fitment almost reaches the ceiling and is of five bays - the central three protruding and the outside two angled - with round-headed arches and mirrored backing. The heavily detailed bar counter is the original one and there is a Victorian tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace. There is more original panelling and glass in the hotel lobby - two interior doors have 'Hotel' deep cut glass panels. Exterior frosted glass windows and stained glass fanlights with leaf decoration. Pity about the conservatory extension.",

Until c.1965 the pub consisted of the right hand side only where there were two small rooms and an off sales at the rear with the original entrance being at the front and all this was merged into the present public bar. The oldest fittings are the dado panelling on the left and front walls with some bench seating attached on the left which may be Victorian. The front section had fully panelled walls but in 1987 the top part was cut back. The counter looks old but could be from c.1965, the bar back dates from 1965 but could be 1980s and there is a panelled ceiling in the front section.

The interior was three small rooms divided by flimsy partitions. The front bar was accessed via the right hand door. The public bar was in the centre and a passage created by a partition ran from the left hand door into the rear smoke lounge. The pub has what looks like a 1930s (maybe 1960s?) bar counter, which has lost its dark stain and has a modern replacement top; the pot shelf is also modern. It retains a 1930s bar back fitting with leaded mirror panels, fielded panelled walls to picture frame height all around the room (some of the dado is different so may be older) and there is a 1930s brick fireplace at the rear. In 2017 the panelling was painted various shades of blue and the fireplace grey. Ceiling panels and cross beams in mock Tudor fashion. Ladies toilet has a terrazzo floor and the gents' downstairs has three big Doulton urinals but modern tiling.\r\n\r\nThe pub re-opened in the summer of 2017 after a 3 month closure for internal refurbishment. The old red carpet has been removed and the floor boards stripped bare. The \"old\" pot shelf has been removed to be replaced by a new one. Back bar also looks modern. The old 1930's furniture has been replaced by more modern chairs and bar stools. Modern fixed bench seating at the rear. Wall paper covers much of the left hand side panelling. Liberal amounts of grey paint have been applied with new d\u00e9cor and lighting. The fireplace remains as do the ladies and gents toilets. The leaded glass windows at the front look to be new too.",

        "Description": "A four-storey corner building from the early 19c, previously known as the Saint James Hotel and Piggott\u2019s after the owner.  Probably a former Kemp Town Brewery pub. \r\n\r\nOriginally two rooms as evidenced by the two external doors and the marking on the floor inside the side door in Madeira Place, now one bar with a long bar counter but with two separate bar backs either side of where the lost partition was.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand side bar back (set back at 45 degrees to the room) is the more impressive, being full height with a central bay flanked by two half bays with square columns and arched top with carved details at the top of each corner. All bays have a wooden shelf running across them at half height with cut and etched glass backing. Interestingly the two half bays have a small relief panel (carved wood?) at the top in an orange colour. The bar back is late Victorian in appearance as is the cut and etched glass panes with a florid floral design.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand bar back is very similar in design and looks, and there are some crucial differences, the most notable being the height which is about two to three feet short of the ceiling (with a ventilation shaft running along the top of the ceiling) and longer with the central bay being twice as wide as the two end bays. Again, all three bays are divided half way by a shelf supported by square columns. However, the detailing in the wood is less elaborate than the right-hand bar back. Cut and etched glass panes at the back but with a different design to the other bar back. The look and appearance are again late Victorian, but I think that this bar back is a reproduction as the wood looks to be a lot newer and the fitting to the back wall isn't quite right (it looks to be attached to some older wood too).\r\n\r\nThe bar counter top could be late Victorian, but it has clearly been re-fronted at some stage and painted to look like old wood.  See the left-hand corner return to see the damaged angled panels. There is an old fireplace at the back of the room with a wood surround but not original, I fear. The only part which looks original is the hearth. Exposed floor boards throughout and covered in black pitch/tar. There is half height tongue and groove panelling throughout, but they look modern (you can see where the nails have been inserted) and so too is the wooden fixed bench seating to the right of the side entrance near the fireplace, which is an import.",

In the conversion from public house to a Two Bulls Steakhouse restaurant (pub licence not renewed) the former servery area now contains a kitchen but the original bar counter (new top) remains in place and the bar back, which only dates from 2001, was turned through 90 degrees. Two original fireplaces remain (the rear one has been heavily restored) and original panelled walls to picture frame height all around has been painted grey. There originally was a small private bar at the rear and internal screens have been removed. Ceiling beams and friezes have plaster trail of vine leaves leaves and bunch of grapes. On the left is a function room (currently being restored) with a flat barrel vaulted roof which was modernised in 2001 involving the removal of the panelled walls and only the parquet floor and high ceiling are original.",

        "Description": "A typical terraced building, Georgian or Victorian, its Facebook site states it was once an old posting inn called the Venus Ale House, later renamed the Rising Sun. When its licensed premises were larger, encompassing the next door Queens House, it was known as the Cinque Ports Hotel. Much evidence remains of an interwar refit with half-height tongue and groove panelling all around the interior. Entrance is through a central vestibule with doors once leading off each side. Only the top half now remain as windows, the lower dados being matching but cruder replacements (photos 1 & 2). There is a central arrangement of pillars and posts before the bar counter, denoting the division of two main front bars and perhaps the site of a jug and bottle (photos 3 &4). Central floor area is of old boards and the counter is of tongue and groove panelling with brass foot rail (photo 5). The central part of the bar back also appears to be an interwar original, although the flanking shelving is either a matching replacement or an add-on. Front-right public bar area has 1930s red tile floor and modest wood surround fireplace (photo 6). Front windows here are replacements. Ladies toilets have tongue and groove panelling and 1930s windows. External door to left side is now blocked up. This side of the pub has much depth and was once probably three successive rooms: (i) front, a carpeted area; (ii) middle, an ex-lounge with larger 1930s fireplace (partly obscured by \u2018specials board\u2019 \u2013 photo 3) and fixed wall seating; (iii) beyond the gents toilets, a rear room with no interesting fittings or fixtures but a good view into the old back of the servery and stairs. Perhaps enough here to warrant R.I.",

Tamplins Brewery or the owner in the late 1950s carried out a refitting and the interior is little changed from then. The tenant/owner also owned the famous racehorse Mill House, born in 1957, which won the Gold Cup in 1963, and the Whitbread Cup in 1967, and named the main room the 'Mill House Bar'. In around 1957 a brick and tiled roof was added to the front left and at the rear left an extension added to bring toilets inside.  \r\n\r\nThe original front public bar was converted to a small snug bar with a wood block floor, a distinctive curved 1950s counter front with a Formica inlaid top, a 1950s bar back fitting with Formica on the main shelf and glass shelves and 1950s fitted seating. The original stone fireplace remains with an old fireback and log fire.  \r\n\r\nThe main bar has a wood block floor, the large wavy curved bar counter is of a classic 1950s style with a Formica inlaid top, the 1950s bar back is as the snug one - all the lower bar back shelves are definitely 1950s with just a couple of fridges replacing part. Note the number of (Tamplins) barrel seats which date from the refitting. The small dining room at the rear also looks of a 1950s style and the seating is arranged in a stable-like way.",

Objections against redevelopment were lodged by the South East Sussex Branch, but the Parish Council of Chiddingly proposed to Wealden Council planners that the conversion should go ahead! Viability was cited as the reason behind the closure and subsequent planning application, although it is felt that this free-of-tie pub should have been much more thoroughly marketed, to sell or lease as a going concern. This pub is therefore re-categorised as Permanently Closed. The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\r\n\r\nThis 19th century pub with its 1950s refit has recently been 'gastro'd' but is otherwise little changed - possibly saved by its grade II listing?.

On the right the saloon bar also looks like it would have been two rooms in the past and has old dado panelling at the rear and the brick fireplace could be 1930s or 1950s. However, the bar counter is a much more modern now painted grey one as are the bar back shelves which is very modern - it could be that the off sales was lost for these newer fittings. At the rear a red and black quarry tiled floor passage leads to he former function room now a dining room in a wood clad extension which would appear to have been added in the 1950s with floor to ceiling panelling, brick fireplace and some fixed seating.",

        "Description": "Late 16th-century timber-framed Old Town pub with a Victorian frontage. After it was sold by private owners to Brode's Brewery in c.1900 changes were made, and by 1907 the pub consisted of a public bar on the left, bottle & jug in the centre, and tiny bar parlour on the right with a small servery in the centre - hence the two front doors. The layout today is as a result of a 1952 refurbishment by Fremlins Brewery. The bar parlour, bottle & jug and public bar were combined by removing partitions to form the present front bar and a new bar counter with black Formica top installed on the left hand side (the new licensees have since replaced the Formica top with a wooden one and installed a mirrored glass backing to the back bar). The unusual three bay bar back with three drawers - one a till - looks to be an inter war one but installed in 1952. The old Tudor shaped stone surround fireplace has a brick interior from 1952, the panelled walls are painted red (now painted white by the new licensees ) and fixed seating is from the 1950s (or later). Note the mummified cat in a case on the wall.  \r\n\r\nWhat was a Club Room at the rear became the Smoke Room and a small servery added in 1952 - note the handpumps have a lead drip tray. It has an old Tudor shaped stone surround fireplace with 1930s brick interior and panelled walls are painted red (now painted grey & white by the new licensees ) . The present toilets date from 1952.  In 1983 a customer, Mark Pennington, recreated an old pub game called Loggetts which is played out of doors and is a variation on bowls. Loggets is played on the 2nd Sunday in August at the end of 'Old Town' week.",

Thousands of pubs throughout the country had similar internal refits but virtually all of them have subsequently been refurbished. The Ship still retains 2 small bars as the locals refuse to allow the owners to make changes! The Ship is a 19th century building which was also refurbished in the 1930s. The public bar has old panelling on the walls and ceiling, a 1930s brick fireplace and it was only the bar counter and bar back that were changed in 1963. the bar back fitting has an illuminated red barrel insignia and the wording 'Watneys' and 'Tamplins'. The curved bar counter has a Formica top and the front has a nautical-style rope at the top. 'The Bisset Automatic Darts Scorer', from the 1930s which requires you to use a finger to mechanically reduce the score from 501, is no longer used and has been attached, for some strange reason, to the bottom of the wall behind the door! The former leaf (swing door) entrance now made into one door but retaining original leaded glass 'Public Bar'.  \r\n\r\nThe saloon bar was completely revamped and slightly extended in 1963 and has floor to ceiling ply panelled walls completely covered in nautical items. The bar counter is of panels joined by strips of copper so as to resemble a straightened barrel and has a Formica top with copper edging. the bar back has the wording 'Watneys' and 'Tamplins' in the illuminated top section and only part of the lower shelves is missing having been replaced by fridges. The stone fireplace is from the 1960s which is the date of the nautical-style circular windows in the doors. In 1963 new toilets replaced the former outside ones. All the windows on The Twitten (south side) were replaced in 1990s with double glazed ones but with old style lettering proclaiming 'Tamplins Ales', 'The Ship Inn' and 'Cask Ales' (saloon window). The panelling in the entrance lobby to the saloon bar is from 1990s. All bar furniture is quite modern. The building was 3 cottages until 1890's.",

There is a hatch in the passageway for service.  \r\n\r\nThe small rear bar has a counter with old glazed panels in the partition above it so service is through a wide hatch. The wood panelling may be 1930s work, now painted deep pink. The left-hand room has dado panelling on the tiny front section and could have been amalgamated with former private quarters at some time to create a larger room. The rear section has a Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace and there is a toad in the hole game in the front section. An upstairs room, formerly two small rooms, has been brought into use in recent years and has a Victorian tiled and cast-iron fireplace and on the walls is some dray horse tack from Beards Brewery stables.  \r\n\r\nThe Lewes Arms controversy - an entry on Wikipedia - details the protests by locals at Greene King's decision in December 2006 to remove Harveys Best Bitter from sale involving a 133 day boycott of the pub. The pub is famous for playing the most unusual of all pub games - Dwyle Flunking - just outside the pub. Also, an annual pea throwing contest, pantomime and poetry; and Lewes is famous for the largest celebration of Guy Fawkes Night with its 'Lewes Bonfire' which attracts 80,000 spectators.",

The public bar is virtually unaltered with its parquet floor, original and distinctive bar counter front (new top), 1950s brick fireplace and some dado panelling but all that remains of the bar back is the cabinet work - originally it did have beer served from cask ends and a mural. It is a pity about the overpowering addition of a pot shelf.  \r\n\r\nThe left hand bar is a conversion of two rooms in 2003 when one third of the bar back was removed to create a gap into the rear dining room and the majority of the original bar counter turned through 90%; the bar top is new. Both areas retain their original brick fireplaces, parquet floor in the front area remains but new tiles added to cover the former servery area and added over the parquet floor in the rear area. Dado panelling in the rear area has been painted and original gents retained. There is a distinct original bench in both the right hand bar and the rear area of the left hand bar.",

All these areas have match-board wall-panelling and seem to have undergone a refit probably in the 1920s \u2013 for example the addition of the adzed beams to add to the antique air: with these go the external, mock Tudor remodelling bay on the right. Right of the old servery (modern bar-back) a further beamed snug with old fireplace, then a further couple of rooms which contain what is probably 1920s panelling and period fireplaces. Considerably extended to the rear in 2004 when Mitchells & Butlers removed a garden bar and added a new lounge bar and more seating areas to the rear right.

        "Description": "Situated in the heart of Broadstairs this was originally a shop and public house from the late 19th century of brick with granite faced pilasters. It was refitted in c.1882 and retains most of its plan form and fittings from that date. On the front far left is the tiny bare wood floored private bar with a Victorian mahogany bar counter with deep detailing and at a lower height to the other counters, also a Victorian bar back fitting with mirrors, delicate columns holding up the shelves and at the top a coved frieze with swags. It has full height panelled walls and ceiling, just one table, an old bench and the odd bar stool. \r\n\r\nA doorway width gap links the private bar to the public bar on the front right also with bare wood floor, a panelled Victorian mahogany counter with fluted pilasters with scrolled tops and the three-bay bar back fittings as the one in the private bar. Sadly lower shelves here have been replaced by fridges. It has full height panelled walls and bare slatted benches attached to dado panelling on the front window side. The front left window is curved and there is a \u2018Public Bar\u2019 etched window in the door. A canted, full-height partition wall / screen with double doors that are permanently open and glazed panels at the top leads to the rear lounge. \r\n\r\nOn the front right a door with a modern \u201cPrivate Bar\u2019 panel leads to a passage created by the partition wall. What is now the saloon bar was originally an off sales at the front and a smaller saloon bar at the rear. You can still see traces on the ceiling of where the partitions that created the off sales compartment were. It is hard to believe that the double doors in the remaining partition existed originally since off-sales customers weren\u2019t intended to mingle with the rest of the pub. \r\n\r\nThe saloon bar retains its semi-circular Victorian mahogany counter with fluted pilasters with scrolled tops and a small bar back fitting with bevelled mirrors and at the top a coved frieze with swags. This L-shaped room has old bench seating and a Victorian cast-iron and wood surround fireplace. Hanging from the ceiling in the lounge is 'The Glue Pot'. The story in a frame tells of locals who lingered so long in the pub after work and before dinner led to several drinks and inevitably the men were late for their meals, \"Sorry I got stuck in the Neptune\" was their reason for being late so one year the wives got together and presented to the men 'The Glue Pot'. \r\n\r\nA set of double doors on the front far left lead into a passageway with a door on the right into the private bar. A door at the rear of the passage leads into the dining room at the rear left and was the access to rooms upstairs for guests. A room on the right has been brought into use and has been both a games room and restaurant in the past. It was Grade II listed in 1999 after locals and landlord created a storm of protests about proposed changes.",

It is served from a split door with ledge which is usually kept open as from here you can reach the rear room by walking through part of the servery area but we recommend you ask for permission first. \r\n\r\nThe rear bar was extended back in 1948 and has a panelled bar counter at least 70 years old, possibly a 1930s bar back fitting also a 1930s style brick fireplace. On the counter is a water clock which a 1965 paper cutting confirms is not the original which announced the hour by striking out the first four bars of 'Little Brown Jug' on eight glasses sitting on the base by electrically activated hammers. In the past water would pour out of the tap into the copper jug. but now operates at about 9am and 9pm and only plays 'on the hour' rarely. The revised version no longer pours water and little Smurfs play the tune by hammers onto xylophone-looking metal panels over pipes, each labelled with a letter for the note. It features a Cobbs of Margate cask front and was converted to work electronically and red lights indicate the time. A corner cabinet has been added to store Boules - the pub has a Boules Pitch taking up most of the garden. A further curved one from the 18th century was added later to store more balls!

The modest island 'gantry'/bar-back fitting may be original but the pot shelf is modern. In 2005 a false ceiling was added. A number of good etched windows remain though some may be replacements. The small areas of fixed seating in the bay windows are also original. There is a fine dado of brown tiling on the right-hand side wall, a ceramic fireplace and Art Nouveau stained glass window.

An outbuilding on the left has been pressed into service as a games room. Behind the servery was a small snug but this is no longer in use.",

        "Description": "This pub gives an excellent idea of how pubs were laid out and fitted up c.1900. Plans were drawn up for it in 1893 but the Art Nouveau details of some of the internal glasswork suggest work was going on in Edwardian times. The sense of separate rooms is conveyed by the different room names in the door and window glass, and a screen still with its door dividing the main bar into two. On the right is a large \u2018Lounge and Tea Room\u2019, evidently planned with holidaymakers in mind.\r\n\r\nThere are 'Billiards' etched panels on the two doors from the smoke room from which it may have changed. An excellent refurbishment by owners, Shepherd Neame, in 2005 preserved the old work and created a small snug in the left-hand part, using a formerly redundant office space. Modern counter: the bar-back is from 2005 replacing modern work. There was an off-sales shop (in addition to the jug & bottle) which was later turned into a private bar, wording still on inner door. The room behind the bar brought into use after the refurbishment was originally an office and has tall wooden doors hatch for service. Note the penny in the old slot on a toilet door in the gents.Retains the old snob screens in the cellar. Shepherd Neame wanted to remove the screen but the Landlord preserved it. Has a 'Ladies Gin Room' window.",

        "Description": "Two-storey brick and half-timbered inn which may have parts that date back to Tudor times but has seen many changes over the years. The entry on this inventory is for the room created by a spectacular settle whose back bulges out into the entrance corridor. The original pub consisted of the settle room, corridor, front left room (first part) and rear left room. The remaining parts of the building to either side of the bar were used as store rooms. Now it is an extraordinary amalgam of nooks and crannies and lots of exposed timber-work. In 1963 there was a number of changes including the installation of some quality fittings but with the removal of parts of partitions. This has meant that all the various spaces are interlinked apart from a room at the rear left, which does retains its door. \r\n\r\nLeft-hand door leads into a corridor with an old, very worn red-tiled floor, the right hand side of the corridor being created by the mighty bulging settle. Just before the settle there is the original door into the settle room. The room has a red tiled floor, an old brick, tile and wood surround fireplace with a log fire, the bay window of this room was added in 1913 \u2013 the floor indicates the change \u2013 and the old wall benches here and the cabinet, were added at this time. Above the impressive curved settle are old wood panels that reach the ceiling. Sadly, the partition at the rear is lost creating a widish gap into the room. \r\n\r\nOn the left of the corridor a doorway (gap reduced by the positioning of a high backed settle) leads into a small two-part room with new flagstone-like floor, also with a bay window also added in 1913. This was originally a small saloon bar according to old postcards in a frame on the back of the settle and therefore has been doubled in size by knocking through to another small room in 1963. The snug part at the rear has a brick fireplace with an old fireback now situated above it which does look like 1963 work. \r\n\r\nAt the rear left is another small low, beamed room with a door and screeded floor \u2013 this is another original room (called the Candle Room?). The entrance passageway continues with a red brick floor and leads to a piece of bar counter made of ancient timbers and brick and dating from 1963. Beyond the settle room is an area in front of the servery with a flagstone floor having been moved back to create greater space. The original serving hatch was approximately 4ft from the back of the snug \u2013 the bar fittings date from 1963 or later. \r\n\r\nOn the right is the King Charles Room, a large \u2018barn-like\u2019 room with open rafters and nooks and crannies which were brought into use in post-war times \u2013 see a newspaper article on the back of the settle which indicates it was in use in the 1950s. Some of the stained glass was procured from the Blitz, however this will soon be relocated to a new dining area. It had an old brick fireplace but this was lost when this room was sympathetically extended to the right in 2017 and modern fireplace added as well as new toilets at the rear right (also lost was three big urinals in both gents). The fielded panelled bar counter dates back to 1963 but the bar-back was replaced much more recently. \r\n\r\nFor some unaccountable reason the main bar back sports a wooden carving of the Last Supper! Equally unaccountable is their website's imaginative and unverifiable claim to be the oldest free house in England. In 2017-18 the building was being extended to double it existing size to add 12 bedrooms and a new dining area.",

The pub was named after the Nore sandbank at the mouth of the Thames, just off Sheerness, which provided deep anchorage for the Royal Navy in Napoleonic times. \r\n\r\nLeft hand lobby has a red tiled floor and 1930s fielded panelling to picture frame height (blocked-up door on the right) with a left hand door having \u2018Lounge\u2019 etched narrow panel. The left hand bar retains a wood block floor and 1930s fielded panelling to picture frame height all around. On the left is a brick fireplace that might date from the 1930s or later. It is believed the bar counter is the original fielded panelled one but the front is covered over in a very modern finish and a new top added. The bar back fitting is a replacement \u2013 a photo of the original can be found at < http://www.dover-kent.com/2014-project-c/Nore-Sheerness.html>. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a door with a narrow 30s glass panel \u2018Cloak Rooms\u2019 etched panel which leads into a lobby with a red tiled floor and a dado of fielded panelling. On the left of the lobby is the ladies with a red tiled floor (wall tiles modern) and \u2018Ladies\u2019 etched panel in the door. On the right is the gents\u2019 with a \u2018Gents\u2019 narrow etched panel in the door, modern red floor tiles and wall tiles; WC has old floor tiles. \r\n\r\nA doorway sized gap leads to the middle room still with its original wood block floor and 1930s fielded panelling to picture frame height. The middle room has been opened-up to the right hand room. \r\n\r\nThe right hand exterior door leads into a lobby with \u2018Public Bar\u2019 on the window in the door, red tiled, brick shaped floor and 1930s fielded panelling to picture frame height. There is a blocked up door ahead and the right hand door has a narrow \u2018Public Bar\u2019 etched panel. The right hand room has a wood block floor and 1930s fielded panelling to picture frame height all around. It is believed the bar counter is the original fielded panelled one but the front is covered over in a very modern finish and a new top added. Alos, a small section in the middle has been removed to insert a buffet dispenser and the stained and leaded glass above looks modern. The bar back fitting could be the original but much modernised. The fireplace looks more modern than 1930s. On the rear right is a door with \u2018Bottle & Jug\u2019 showing there was an off license at the rear originally but the partition which separated it from the bar has been lost.",

        "Description": "A building in decidedly two halves: the painted early nineteenth-century brick structure serves as the restaurant but what is of interest to us is the large red-brick block designed in 1898 for Shepherd Neame by Edward Pover & Son of Faversham (who drawings are displayed and who also worked at the Bear). What remains is much window glass and the spacious, elegant L-shaped servery (with impressively curved bar counter) and wonderful full-height back fitting divided up by tall columns: especially notable is the series of no less than twelve drawers (a UK record?) for cash and storage. As built, there was a hotel entrance on Preston Street (reception desk still there) and a public bar on the corner flanked by a pair of private bars: then beyond the right-hand one of these and partly behind the servery was a lounge. All this can still be read \u2013 but no thanks to what happened in 1966 when the place was opened up. But then, in 2007, under the enlightened Chris MacLean, three screens were reinstated in their original positions (albeit with openings), so we can appreciate the place much as fin-de-si\u00e8cle travellers did as they waited for or piled off their trains!",

The front parts are largely opened out and modernised though some decorative ceiling plasterwork remaining. The opening rear left, however, leads to a most characterful back portion. The corridor ahead has a glazed and heavily bowed partition behind which is a small bar that was 'gentlemen only' until about 1973. A now-closed door in the partition suggests this space was once split into two tiny rooms. The bar itself has old dado panelling and a very old bench at the rear; the counter is in the same style as the rest of the room but is more recent and the bar-back shelves mix old and new. Separating this bar from a lobby area is a glazed partition that almost reaches the ceiling and has a doorway and three sliding windows in the open position, two of which form hatches for service. The lobby has old dado panelling with bench seating attached and a baffle by the back door. Up three steps is a lounge, converted in 1992 from a former 'family room' for the licensee. It has a modern 'window' cut into the partition wall for supervision purposes.",

Old fixed seating in the public bar but that in the back room is modern. The back room fronting Blue Boar Street is the most impressive with floor to ceiling panelling from the inter-war period; also brass bell-pushes survive from the days of waiter service. In the bar and snug the pewter bar top was replaced in 2000. The bar back fittings are modern, possibly part of the 2000 refurbishment.\n\r\nIn glass fronted display cases on the walls of both main rooms and on the ceiling of the back room has accumulated a prodigious collection of ties which cover anything from the St Moritz Toboganning Club to Chichester Theological College! The Victorian tradition in which pubs could be museums or cabinets of curiosities lives on here. The ladies' toilet is accessed via a spiral staircase off the snug.",

        "Description": "In the heart of historic Banbury, this wonderful old inn may have originated as a fifteenth-century timber-framed structure and was extended in the early/mid-sixteenth century. It was an inn perhaps from about 1570 but the first mention of it by name was in 1666. For our purposes the main attraction is the Globe Room of 1637, a near-square space which was richly fitted out immediately after building with superb panelling, a stone fireplace, Ionic columns framing the great east window, and a pair of ornate doors plus a richly-moulded plaster ceiling (see old photos in the pub). The panelling was sold off in 1912 but, after storage in London, was returned in 1965 and finally reinstalled in its original home which formally reopened in 1984. Not so the ceiling, plaster casts of which are in the Victoria & Albert Museum. The front part of the pub is thought to have comprised two small rooms either side of a corridor. There are a couple of seventeenth-century fire surrounds (no doubt imported from elsewhere), a heavily beamed ceiling and some old panelling. The faux-antique spelling of the name is relatively modern (in 1760 it was the \u2018Rein Deer & Plough\u2019) but, as the mosaic floor at the entrance testifies, it was current by the early twentieth century.",

The bar on the right with uneven flagstone floor, an old piece of furniture with cupboards and drawers for a bar counter (for how long ?), half tongue \u2018n\u2019 groove panelling, a large brick fireplace and the room has been extended back and knocked-through at some time. A modern extension on the right houses a separate dining room. The pub's name is believed to be associated with historic political reformer John Wilkes. He championed the common people and was held in the tower of London for his criticism of the King and the government. He eventually held office as mayor of London.",

The walls have fielded panelling all around, it retains the original bar counter front that slopes inwards with a conical corner and the lower bar back shelving appears original BUT upper shelving modern as are the superstructures over the bar with supports made from old yacht mast - all done c2010.  \r\n\r\nThe front section has retained its original fireplace of 1930s brick and fielded panelling surround and mantelpiece but the rear fireplace (called the Anglers Den) has been replaced by modern fielded panelling in the same style as the 1930s ones. Look for the odd bell push, some original leaded glass, and the seat made from the stern of a boat where one panel can be removed to reveal a small painting.  \r\n\r\nAn opened out section (done  c2010) leads to the middle room with a carpet on the parquet floor, original panelled bar counter (new top), a 1930s brick fireplace and more fielded panelling but the bar back is modern. The area on the right of the counter with a new piece of back fitting (and a kitchen beyond) was originally the way to the toilets but a new toilet block was added on the rear left (note the slope up to the gents').  \r\n\r\nOriginally there was a folding partition separating the middle and right-hand rooms but this is no longer in place so there is a wide gap with curtains across it. The right-hand room also has original fielded panelling on the walls, 1930s brick fireplace with a fielded panelled surround, though all has now been painted over.",

        "Description": "This pub's claim to fame is that it was the first permanent public house to be built in Britain since World War II. The old Fox was virtually destroyed by fire in October 1946 - it was re-built as a replica in 1949 using much of the original material and officially reopened on 19th Jan 1950 by brewers Henty & Constable and is little altered over the years. Also of interest are the two Arun District Council Blue Plaques attached to the front of the pub: one for George Morland, a late Georgian painter of animals and rustic scenes and the other is for the better-known poet and artist William Blake who got himself arrested here in 1803 for making seditious remarks to a soldier.  \r\n\r\nThe Saloon Bar on the right features much older full-height oak panelling which came from Colonel Henty's house in Westgate, Chichester. To the right of the door is the old panelling; to the left there is matching panelling from 1949. The bar back looks like the original one with some modern additions, the counter front has fielded panelling from 1949 but a new top. The fireplace in this room is modern; the gents' has been modernised.  \r\n\r\nThe small snug looking area to the left of the main bar was originally an off licence with the curved window for display and the door is now a window - easily visible on the exterior as it still has the licensees details panel above it. In 1990 the partition forming the off license was removed and fielded panelling of a similar style to that in the bar and lounge was added to this area blocking-up the hatch to the servery.  \r\n\r\nThe Nautical Bar on the left also retains its original panelling on the walls in a lighter shade. The counter is also original with a fielded panelling front but the Formica top is modern. The bar back retains old lower shelves but half have been replaced by fridges; above there is a cupboard and panelling on the walls which are original but other woodwork is modern, as is the gents'.",

However, don\u2019t be fooled, the doorway is not in use, customers nowadays have to pass through to an open courtyard.  Immediately in front is the outside gents', and the original 1840s pub building that is now the kitchen and store. To the left, and the same building with the disused bar entrance, is the present pub, converted from the stable block and hayloft of the nearby Manor House in 1904. There are two rooms, a public bar, and a smaller saloon/family room.  \r\n \r\nThe Public Bar is a long rectangular room and upon entering from the back door, the bar counter is immediately ahead. The counter and fittings appear to date from the early 20th Century, apart from the pot shelf which was added in 1995 for the filming of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Detectives\u201d, this would suggest they could be the original 1904 work. The walls are covered with wooden panelling with wider painted panels on the upper sections and narrower stained ones used for the lower dado. The bar front has a panelled front matching the dado and a large skirting around the base. The counter appears original and the aforementioned pot shelf does not look out of place. There is old shelving behind the bar, although some of this may have been modified to accommodate the casks from which the ale is drawn directly. Underfoot are bare floorboards and the ceiling has a number of rectangular sections, both may well be original.  \r\n \r\nThe simple smaller saloon bar is entered from a separate outside door, has a (possibly) 1950\u2019s era bar counter and an asymmetrical brick fireplace incorporating a small tapered tiled hood. This room also has panelled walls with dado and some of the shelving could well predate the (possibly) 1950\u2019s refit, especially in what appears to be a blocked up window by the bar hatch.  \r\n \r\nOne of the outbuildings in the courtyard has been demolished to create an outdoor patio, however, this was never part of the pub operation. In addition to the outside gents', the ladies' also have to venture across the courtyard when nature calls.",

Has lost its off sales which has been absorbed into the bar, though the former outside door space is discernible, but the counter inside must have been replaced as there is no indication of where the off sales counter was. \r\n\r\nThe smaller lounge bar has another old possibly 1950s counter, the bar back has a small leaded panel and is different in style to the public bar one so was added later (30s or maybe 50s?). There is a splendid early 20th century blue tiled and wood surround fireplace but dado panelling is new. Some etched window panels are old, others replaced at various times over the past 100 years.",

It passed into the hands of the village in 1608 under the bequest of Ralph Newbery, a local boy who made (very) good as a publisher in London. It is said to have become a pub in 1723 and revenues from it still benefit the village.  \r\n\r\nThe best room is the carpeted lounge (note the interwar entrance doorway) on the right with exposed arched roof trusses, a fielded panel bar front (possibly 1930s) and shelving, some from same period and some more from only around 1990. The rear wall has some Jacobean fielded panelling with a lozenge pattern. Old wood surround and 1930s brick fireplace with a three bay carved Jacobean panelled mantelpiece. Just inside the room on the left there is a short bench attached to very old dado panelling and more on the front wall and around to the fireplace on the right. The baffles near the fireplace appear loose so possibly imported?  \r\n\r\nThere is one of a number of very old oak doors at rear and beyond is a part brick part tiled passage with a stble door entry to the servery for staff.  \r\n\r\nLeft of this is the main bar with a bare wood floor where the bar counter front looks to be an interwar. There is a small piece of the inter-war bar back but the top section has shelving dating from around 1990 and fridges have replaced most of the lower part. There is old wood surround and brick fireplace with ancient fireback and a log fire.. The bay window has exposed brick and some modern benches.  \r\n\r\nFront door leads to a passage and on the right is a \u2018Bar\u2019 door, but this is no longer in operation as entrance to the left hand bar is from a widish gap at the end of the passage. On the left of the passage is a latch door \u2013 open it and up a step you will find a very small, carpeted room with just one large table ready for diners. The rear wall is of very old timbers and includes two cupboards in the upper part.  \r\n\r\nThe corridor leads to a plain bare wood floor room at the rear, which looks as though it is a relatively new addition to the public areas with a post-war brick fireplace and a glass topped well: here you can see a copy of the deeds.",

An attractive circular stained glass effigy of (reputably) Queen Charlotte (wife of George III) from c1930s in one of the window panes, though the main exterior pub sign is of Queen Elizabeth I.

        "Pub Name": "Black Horse",
        "Address": "Burncote Lane, Checkendon, RG8 0TE",
        "Description": "This well hidden away rural pub is a real step back in time. Rightly nicknamed the 'pub in the woods', it is situated north of the village down a narrow lane off the road to Stoke Row and attached to a farm. Since 1905 it has been in the same family who ran the diary farm until the mid 1980s. Margaret Stallwood bought the freehold of the pub in 1952 and ran it until her death in 1993 aged 86. The present owners Margaret and Martin Morgan has continued to run it as a truly old fashioned pub with the only food being hot baguettes and bacon rolls served at lunchtimes, as well as crisps and nuts. They are assisted by three daughters including Claire who runs a riding school next to the pub. \r\n\r\nIt is a long redbrick building which apparently dates back to the 18th century and has an attractive green painted part glazed veranda all along the front with old wooden seating and a red brick floor. Note the old 'Guinness In Bottle' glass fronted advertising wall sign by the left entrance and a Bass in Bottle' glass fronted advertising wall sign by the right (main) entrance. Inside are three small rooms but some changes in post-war times have seen the two right hand rooms more joined together than originally. It is likely that originally there would have been an inner porch with doors to the left and right; also probably a corridor ran along the exterior wall side and there was a door into the middle room. So a wall looks to have been taken out. \r\n\r\nOn the right is a small room with a red quarry tiled floor that houses the servery at the far right of the building and has remarkably basic woodwork that must once have been common in thousands of rural pubs. There is a bar counter at least 100 years old and now painted a pale green colour and a bar back featuring shelves of a similar age. There are no modern items here \u2013 even the till is an old wooden pull-out drawer designed to take cash and the beer bill is totted up by pen and paper. The beer is fetched from the cellar on the right end of the servery with the figure \u20184\u2019 on the door. \r\n\r\nThis room has some dado panelling also painted a pale green and a brick fireplace that looks 1930s but may have been installed just after the war with a log fire. There are indications on the ceiling in this room that it was at one time in the distant past divided into two by a partition wall. The servery area and bar still have a nicotine stained ceiling. \r\n\r\nYou can walk either side of the fireplace into the middle room which has another brick fireplace that looks 1930s but may have been installed just after the war. The panelled dado here is painted a dark green and this room is more plushly furnished with a carpet, armchairs and a settee. The left hand room, which is not always open, was a former domestic room that has been brought into use as a public room. It has a wood surround and 1930s brick fireplace and old dado panelling painted a deep red. It still has the feel of someone\u2019s front room. \r\n\r\nOutside on the left end of the building are the antiquated gents\u2019 with a corrugated asbestos roof and only an urinal. Walk around the right hand end of the pub  and towards the farm buildings at the rear and you will find an outbuilding with the outside ladies and as separate WC for gents\u2019. During the winter months the pub is closed Sunday evening and opening times may vary so best to ring to check.",

Inglenook fireplace at far end has modern stone cladding. At the other end is what looks like a classic 1950s counter. Back shelves look 1930s but more likely 1950s in inter-war style. Part of wall removed to make wider opening to rear games room from inner lobby. Front-left lounge (was public bar) with stepped 1950s counter front. Back shelves appear original 1950s. Matchwood dados, re-sanded parquet floor and fireplace all look 1930s but could be 50s. Restaurant with opened-up access from lounge through timber frames. Parquet floor and matchwood dados extend into here with another 1930s fireplace. Note the former stables on the left.",

        "Description": "Old brick and tile hung building with a 1930s (or just post war) flat roof extension of brick on the front right side, which used to house the toilets but now forms part of the much enlarged lounge. Up to 2014 it had a layout of small public bar to the left, small lounge to the right and quarry tiled drinking passage with split door for off sales between the two rooms and had been little changed for over 50 years. \r\n\r\nThe public bar on the left is largely unchanged with a small bar counter (altered in2015) from the 1930s and a fireplace( looks to be of reclaimed/re-used bricks which may be inter-war). additions (but could well be 1930's). Flagstone floor in the public bar is from c.1983. The former landlord had a photo from the late 1940s showing the matchwood panelling in the front bar just as it is today, but now altered and shortened. The seating in the public bar is pew style and may be c1970s. \r\n\r\nThe quarry tiled drinking passage with split door for off-sales between the two rooms has gone - there is a new flagstone-like floor from the front door made of concrete to resemble flagstones laid in 2015 and the dado panelling in the passage has been painted a pastel mushroom colour. The small lounge to the right has seen much change - it has been opened-up to the passage and has the same faux flagstone floor, of reconstituted material; the counter was originally a distinctive semi-circular 1950s style, but has been moved some 6 feet back so is now visible as you enter the pub and painted a pastel mushroom colour; also the bar back fitting which might well be from a similar date has been moved. Only the fireplace is as was. The toilets at the front of the building have gone, the wall separating them from the lounge removed so the front section of the lounge is double its original size and has a new wood floor. A dining room has been added at the rear in 2015.",

Large gap to the left room which has a brick fireplace of c1930s and is now the restaurant area with modern style tables and chairs fitted out in 2018 - note the memorabilia of when Polish airmen were stationed nearby in WWII (photos, uniform etc).

The \u2018distressed\u2019 wooden boarding in places seems very recent. There is an emphasis on locally sourced food. The pub is leased from the National Trust.",

There are still a number of small rooms around a bar each separated by low timber and glass partitions \u2013 including an intact one with low headroom! Built 1876 as the Wyndham Arms and with a balustrade on the right side of the building it was remodelled internally in the late 19th century and a large portion of these fittings remain. There were further changes after Marstons bought the Winchester Brewery in 1929 \u2013 note the almost a full set of 1930's frosted windows with room names and 'Marstons Burton Beers' in Moderne-style lettering, and the parquet floors.  \r\n\r\nThere is a splendid Victorian curved bar counter and a two-sided elaborate bar back with sets of drawers in both parts; also a Victorian fireplace behind the bar - a very rare survivor. Attached to the bar counter are glazed partitions that separate the Public Bar on the right (possibly two small rooms at some time in the past), the Bottle & Jug \u2013 the partition was removed and two pieces of it are now attached to the wall of the public bar; a Private Bar; and a Smoke Room on the left. The partition between the public bar and former Bottle and Jug is a very rare survivor having a door with a clearance of only 5 ft 6 ins. There are lots of old panelling around the pub and Victorian tiled fireplace. Note the port-hole windows which can still be opened in warm weather.    \r\n\r\nIn the 1990s there were changes on the left hand side and the room behind the Smoke Room was created out of the former cellar. This is venue for folk nights. Also, another room was created in an extension. Another relic of the past is the old 'penny in the slot' on the door to the toilets on the left side. For the sympathetically renovation which retained most of the original fittings the pub received a CAMRA Pub Refurbishment Award.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 2013: The pub suffered a serious fire in February 2012 which mainly affected the upper floors. As part of the restoration a lot of the original woodwork has, sadly, been painted a pastel shade.",

Lino floor, brick open fireplace with wood surround. New uPVC door on R/H of fireplace to the garden area (small lawn) and the open cubicles.  Original door on L/H of fireplace removed and blocked in when new toilets were added to the rear, and original wood bench seating from Snug used to cover the gap. Metal frame windows (most).

Similar style as Public but with some light coloured wood panelling. Bench seating is more recent with white leather padding and chairs to match. Bar and bar back in similar style to Public but in light coloured wood. Light wood canopy over the Bar area which used to have overhead glass racks which have now gone.

On the left is the \u2018Trafalgar Bar\u2019 which is entered through a pair of double doors; on the right is the \u2018Victory Bar\u2019. Both have their old bar counters. A little further back on the left there is the off-sales area (with half-height door-cum-htach) and adjacent to this a delightful small, screened snug, now named the \u2018Poop Deck\u2019 A rear extension was added in about 1990 but it impacts little on the historic core: it was further extended in 2006 to create an even larger room with views over the Solent and its shipping.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nBrick-built hidden away pub stuck in a 1950s time warp - it was a farmhouse (50 acres ?) with a brewery about 100 years ago. The public bar took its present form in the 1950s - prior to that it was two rooms - note the 'Private Bar' and 'Tap Room' etched windows. The bar counter is of 1950s 'beauty board', the two wood surround and brick fireplaces and the dado panelling is from the inter-war period, and there is a piano. The lounge bar down the left hand side of the pub was converted from living quarters in the 1950s so the bar counter and bar back fittings all dates from then. There is a 1920s tiled and wood surround fireplace and a brick fireplace at the other end of the room which looks more 1950s. The sell amazing value lunches  such as a ham, cheese and tomato platter for \u00a33. Note the traditional till is of a number of coin bowls \"we had a power cut recently and it didn't affect us\"!  \n\nUpdate December 2013: Janet Cook, tenant, died in October.  Pub now closed. Fullers state that the lease was due for renewal in January 2014 and that they are 'exploring all options for the Newport in due course'.  \n\nUpdate End of 2014: Advertised as \"Freehold rural pub for sale or available on a new lease.\" and \"Significant development and refurbishment required\".",

The small left room has a counter which could date from the 1950s, the bar back with its leaded glass panels is difficult to date and there is a hatch to the back of the bar in the right hand room created from an old doorway.  \r\n\r\nThe front right small room has a counter which could also date from the 1950s which was reduced in size in the early 1990s - originally it covered the hatch between the front two bars. The bar back shelves could be 50s with leaded mirrored panels and some dado panelling could be old. At the rear the lower bar back shelves and the bar counter could again date from the 50s, possibly 60s and a large stone fireplace could date from c.1960 as could the fixed seating. Facing the front in the right hand bar high up over an old doorway is a very old bar back type shelf and very old windows behind it. Looks like changes in the 1950/60s from an old interior to the three small rooms we see now. Restaurant on the first floor.",

It looks like it expanded from a small public bar on the right to two public rooms in the inter-war period and there have been some changes since. Hardwood double glazed windows fitted in 1985. There is also a separate function room upstairs, accessed by an internal staircase in 1988.  \r\n\r\nNowadays you enter via the left hand door into the L-shaped Saloon Bar with both bare wood and parquet floor (no doubt added when alterations took place in 1988) and  inglenook fireplace on the left containing benches either side. The bar counter is of a distinctive inter-war style with vertical panels and sloping towards to the top; curved in the middle it continues to the rear and there is a couple of swing doors for staff. The bar back shelves attached to old vertical panels appear later additions, possibly 1977 when the bar area was remodelled. The walls are lined with dado panelling and bare wood backed fixed seating including the small snug area at the rear left; the above dado panelling attached to the staircase here is certainly a modern addition from the 1988 alterations.  \r\n\r\nA door leads to the Tap Room which was the original public bar on the right \u2013 the exterior door is no longer in use as this room is used more as a dining room nowadays so expect \u2018reserved\u2019 signs on the tables. This old bare wooden floor small room has a two-sided panelled bar counter with brackets that could be a hundred years old. The bar back consists of later shelving on a mirrored back and a lower section with an old drawer (alongside a modern sink). There is more panelled walling and bare wood backed fixed seating, which could date from inter-war times, and an old wood surround with brick interior fireplace which dates from at least the 1930s, but with a modern log burner. The timbers on the wall in the far right area is old wood but was added by a previous licensee in the 1990s. On the far right the gents\u2019 toilets were added in 1989 to replace outside ones.  \r\n\r\nUpstairs is a function / dining room with a 'barrel' ceiling and walls lined with fielded panelling that looks to be from the inter-war times. There is a marble fireplace, possibly a later replacement. The present access of a staircase from the left hand bar was created in 1988 to replace the original exterior access from the left hand side of the building.\"",

As a result of the recent concentration on food a Toad in the Hole game has gone from the left hand bar and the fine stag's head Ringing the Bull game which was in the saloon bar is no more. The record is held by Bill Harris who in 1952/3 ringed the stag with 58 consecutive throws - the stag's head has since been moved.

In 1934 Star Brewery of Eastbourne purchased Gasson's Warehouse to the left (part was a blacksmith's shop) and demolished it.

It is situated on Mermaid Street, a cobbled street in the splendid historic small town of Rye. It was run as a club from 1913 and reopened as an hotel in 1945. The inn operated without a full license from 1758 to 1955 with the True Temperance Association having an impact on this. When in 1948 it was granted a full license the inn was not allowed to install a bar and it closed again in 1949.  \r\n\r\nIn 1955 the bar restriction was removed and the lounge bar at the rear has a counter of rough hewn timber overlapping planks and a wooden top that looks like it could date from c.1955. It is difficult to accurately date the bar back fittings but the lower shelves may date from the 1950s. This splendid room has old wall panelling and the Giant's fireplace with its log fire date back to Tudor times.  \r\n\r\nThere is much else to admire in the building including a carved oak screen, inglenook fireplace, three ancient wall paintings, genuine beams, half timbered walls and ancient doors. From the front door a partitioned passage with Tudor panelling and ancient wall paintings leads to the public bar at the rear. To the left of passage is Dr Syn's Chamber, one of two lounges for use by residents and diners only. It has a Tudor shaped stone carved fireplace and the front right lounge has more ancient wall panelling. The main dining room has ancient panelling and two Tudor arch shaped stone fireplaces. There are other rooms of character - it is a pity there is some opening-up in the centre of the hotel. In 1982 the Mermaid held a private luncheon party for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother , the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.  \r\n\r\nHistorical information on this and other Rye pubs from 'The Pubs of Rye' East Sussex 1750-1950 by David Russell (2012) Published by Lynda Russell ISBN 9780956291745",

The small spartan public bar on the right has a bare wood floor, a small curved bar counter which looks to be from the 1950/60s with a brown Formica top, a small 1950s brick fireplace, old dado panelling painted red, some panelling above painted cream and the odd wall bench. \r\n\r\nThe main saloon bar looks like it was two rooms in the distant past but possibly changed into one room in the late 1950s as the bar counter is of ply panels with a fine set of four short porcelain handpumps on a Formica top, but, sadly, the bar back fittings are modern although there is a small till drawer that could date from c.1960. There is a large inglenook fireplace on the left of the room, a 1950s brick fireplace on the right and the fixed seating could be from a similar period. \r\n\r\nThere is a splendid small uneven brick floored snug on the rear left that was probably brought into use in recent times as there are some wall cupboards. The date of the brick fireplace in an inglenook is unknown,  service is via a split door to the side of the servery and on the wall is a fine model of the pub. Still retains an outside gents on the right / public bar side and a shop on the far right is leased out.",

The hotel bar was converted to a pub in 1947 by Wm Younger & Co, and has rare interior featuring wood panelled walls to picture-frame height with different Scotch tartans around the top of the panelling with the name in gold underneath, but several of the panels are well faded/damaged and the odd one missing.  \r\n\r\nBare wooden floored public bar has two 1930s brick fireplaces and was originally three separate rooms - snug facing the sea (with now locked out of use double doors), public at the rear (with a good vestibule entrance on the George Street side.) and hotel reception with food servery for the restaurant area (existing front entrance) where the bar now is. The original bar was on the opposite side, and was a more modest structure (evidence of where it was positioned can still be seen). The current bar and bar back is a later addition from another pub. A stage was added as part of the refurbishment of late 2015.  \r\n\r\nThe left hand bar has recently been brought into much greater use. It also has fielded panelled walls to about six feet in this high ceilinged room but there are no tartan panels here, It has an old bar back fitting with mirrored panels but the good looking bar counter which is shorter than the bar back and matches that in the public bar must also have been imported. It retains a 1947 brick fireplace and there is a modern painted frieze of the countryside above the panelling. Good cornice and ceiling decoration painted brown. Changes were undertaken in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.",

Gents retains its original two massive urinals but is otherwise modernised. Ladies/Disable has a figure '2' on the door. Update 3/09 from Baz Deacon - brick fireplace lost to make way for a staircase to lead upstairs - the panelling for the rooms upstairs is being made in Indonesia! Probably no longer worth including?  \r\n\r\nIn 2008 it was decided to make this small pub more viable by creating a public room upstairs. In order to do this the 1930s brick fireplace was removed and a staircase added. The room upstairs is a similar size to the lower bar and has fielded panelling on the walls (from Indonesia) made to look similar to the original 1930s panels downstairs. The room is mainly used for meetings. The lack of floorplan made this Marginal R I prior to the change and so it is now Marginal No now. Opens at 5pm Mon to Fri.",

Also, the off sales has been absorbed by removal of a partition - note the window panel 'Bottle & Jug' Departmt' on a door on the right.\n\r\nSome boarding on the front of the counter were recently removed to reveal the original Victorian counter front with decorative pilasters with capitals, which has been painted in two shades of blue. The counter has been reduced in length by some three feet on the right hand side. The top is a recent replacement. The original three part bar back fitting remains - the middle section is original with its mirrored panels and a row of drawers - on the right the original upper section with mirrored panels remains but the lower shelving and drawers have been removed and relocated to the left front of the room following the shortening of the counter, but the left hand section is a modern copy and the lower shelves here have been removed for a fridge. There is dado panelling all around the room, on the left there is a Victorian tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace remains but disused and lots of original etched windows.\n\r\nThere is a wide gap to the left room. The front left door (now blocked-up) did lead into a lobby with original partition walls but this has been swept away recently. The lounge was two rooms separated by a partition, as indicated by the recently revealed the parquet floor and two 1930s brick fireplaces. The counter here is actually an old chest of drawers The old dado panelling has been painted light blue. Modernised toilets. Opens at 3 Mon to Fri.",

It has been combined (date?) with another small room with a bare wood floor.  \r\n\r\nThe small middle bar has an large old possibly Victorian fireplace with mirrored carved mantelpiece above. A drawing on the wall shows that in 1964 there was a doorway to the servery and beer was served from casks on a stillage - the counter here was also added in 1972. There is old dado panelling on one wall.  \r\n\r\nThe front saloon bar on a lower level has unusual panelled walls, a baffle/draught screen by the door an old copper fireplace with some tiling above, old wood surround and a coal fire.

It claims one of the davits on the counter and timbers on the ceiling are from the Northern Belle, an American transatlantic ship that sank near Margate. It has a crackin' public bar - L-shaped with bare wood floor, old dado (and some modern), a counter that looks old but painted black and a bar back that is not that old with only one fridge replacing some lower shelves. The good exterior windows 'Shepherd', 'Neame', 'Fine Ales' on one side and 'Margate's', 'Oldest', 'Pub' are mostly modern. The front left door leads to a small wood floor area with an old part glazed partition wall to the rear of the servery that reaches the ceiling with a doorway for staff, dado panelling looks modern and there is an old bench. A bare wood floored passage with old panelling leads to the rear room. Beyond the public bar and slightly opened-up is a small bare wood floored room with some old dado but lots of new wood, some good bench seating and some modern and a hatch to the side of the servery. Gents has two old Doulton urinals. The 2012 refurbishment carefully respected the original layout and fittings.",

There are two bar back fittings at right angles - the one on the rear of the servery with glass shelves and looks to be from the 1960s. \r\n\r\nOn the left the public bar and the parlour (see exterior etched windows) have been combined with the door to the parlour still there on the left. This room has a distinctive bar counter front that looks very 1950s (the pot shelf is a later addition with the frontage in a similar style), the bar back fitting could also be from the 1950s. Until the 1990s there were short partitions on the window side creating seating booths. On the Parlour side there is a large brick fireplace that looks to be of 1930s bricks. Good colourful leaded lights throughout. All the doors have wording that could date from the 1950s (or earlier?). A small function room at the rear has a bar - part brick with wooden panels and tiled top probably from the 1960s. Opens at 4 Mon to Thu.",

The original Charrington's bar back is there with some some modern changes and fridges have replaced some lower shelves. Also, a 1950s brick fireplace remains but there is no sign of original seating.  \n\nThe saloon bar on the left has what could be a 1950s counter but it has a wooden top which replaced a Formica one, the original bar back is more intact than the public bar one, the fixed seating in bays looks 1950s and the floor to ceiling brick fireplace could also be the original. A rear loggia was bricked-in in recent years and is used for storage. The rear function room has part parquet part sprung wood dance floor which is apparently rare(?), an original counter on a tiled plinth and another Charrington's bar back.

Note the archway on the right hand side of the pub which gave access to the old Brewery. The Bourne Stream (from which Eastbourne derives its name) runs through the site though it is now fully culverted.\r\n\r\nThe bar on the right has a dado of a distinct style that could be 1950s but more likely 1930s; the counter front is of the same panelling but stain removed and it has a new top and the bar back is modern. The room has lost its fireplace on the right hand side. Note the interesting split-back chairs that could date from the 1950s (or 1930s?) and probably imported. Also of note are the colour leaded windows on the right hand side with the unusual sloping panelling underneath. The dado panelling continues in the staircase lobby at the rear leading to the (modernised) toilets. The left bar has some fielded panelling on the dado and on the bar counter with a replacement top but has a modern bar back. Note the distinctive swivel bar stools. There is a classic 1930s brick fireplace . Different floorboards indicates this large room could have been two rooms sometime in the past so probably one room since 1930s - no old fittings on far left side. The distracting feature is the small part of the counter removed in about 2007 to create a link between both bars and the new counter front on the return. There is some dado panelling on the passage between the two rooms. There is a kitchen situated between the two bars which could have been an off sales in the past. Gents toilets in left hand bar side are intact 1930s ones with floor to ceiling 1930s glazed brick walls and three big urinals (ladies modernised).",

It also retains inter-war panelled walls, there is an inter-ward panelled bar front, but an inappropriate cast iron Victorian-style fireplace which presumably replaced an inter-war brick one. The original entrance to the snug was where the bookcase is now situated i.e. you accessed it directly off the lobby. Original Crittall metal window frames throughout.  \r\n\r\nUp to c.1980 there was a circular painting on the Mock Tudor-style ceiling showing \u2018The Battle of Southsea\u2019 painted by local artist A Bryant in 1874 which was moved from the original pub. In 1980 it was removed to the City Museum, where it can still be viewed. The pub narrowly missed being damaged in 1941 when a 500 lb delayed action bomb landed in the pub cellar where customers had taken shelter. It was defused and the casing has been part of the pub\u2019s inventory since and was lent to Portsmouth Museum for a war-time exhibition in 1981. Other information collected about the pub by licensee Judith Burr records Dr Arthur Conan Doyle giving evidence at a coroner\u2019s inquest held at the original Barley Mow in the late 19th century.",

Along the wall there is a decoratively carved wood and mirrored fitting under a staircase and more similar work beyond the staircase. The interior is like that of the Abbotsford in Edinburgh which has a separate \u2018Buffet Bar\u2019 situated away from the island but at the Park Tavern there is no sign of a counter.

It retains two bars and some good original windows. The Public Bar has a distinctive bar counter possibly dating from the 1950s (needs research), the bar back has signs of originality but has modern additions and is a bit of a mess \u2013 note how the position of the bar counter does not match up with the bar back fitting on the left side. The Lounge Bar has a 1960s(?) bar counter, the bar back fitting looks like a 1960s replacement with an illuminated panel at the top and glass shelves, the fixed seating probably dates from the 1960s, the dado panelling is not that old, and there is a bench near the bar billiards table that looks like a conversion from some old fixed seating.

        "Description": "This imposing Edwardian pub in a residential district was built 1909 in a half-timbered design with glazed brown tiling for the Lion Brewery, which was taken over early in 1910 by Pike Spicer & Co, which in turn was taken over by Brickwoods later in 1910! Five external doors included the ubiquitous Portsmouth off-sales. The pub somehow managed to avoid being turned into one large single bar when it was owned by Whitbread in the latter part of the last century. What we have today is a two bar local, with a lounge at the rear and a traditional public bar to the front.  \r\n\r\nThe Public Bar on the Chichester Street side has a good vestibule entrance with \u2018Public Bar\u2019 and other etched windows (One has \u2018The Schooner\u2019 on it and is clearly a refit). The bar counter could be old but not original, the bar back fitting has old pillars and capitals but modern additions, bench seating is old but refitted and not the original.  \r\n\r\nThe Lounge Bar counter looks to be from the 1930s and the bar back has some old parts but has a lot of modern additions. Originally two rooms, it is now an L-shaped large room. Good tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace and dado panelling in the rear part but all the seating is modern (or imported). Not enough for R I, but a possible \u2018Of Some Regional Interest\u2019 / R I try also? (MS 4/11) Agree not enough for RI - and not really worth anything else, I'm afraid.",

The lower shelving is intact as no need for modern refrigerated units here - the demand for cold drinks here being satisfied by a domestic fridge placed between the bar backs. There is old dado panelling on the front wall and full height on the rear wall (no panelling in the former right hand bar area). Another interesting feature is internal half shutters housed in boxing beneath three of the windows - these were brought back in to use in 2015. The counter is surmounted with a modern pot shelf from which are suspended pewter mugs. Fireplace is blocked-up and there is no fixed seating.\n\r\nThis pub is something of a timewarp, with no TV, fruit machines, pool table, piped music or jukebox, even the till is an old NCR one that was converted from \u00a3-s-d to decimal currency in 1971 and the maximum that can be rung up is \u00a32.99\u00bd. The only food sold here includes very traditional rolls (ham, cheese or corned beef), pickled eggs, crisps or nuts, as well jars of cockles, bombay mix, pork scratchings and cheddars. Through a door on the left there is a passage with some old dado panelling leading to the toilets.",

        "Description": "Built as a pair of four storey brick built terraced houses in the early 19th century, it was converted into a hotel and then into a public house in the 20th century. Situated just into one of the entrances to The Lanes, it has glazed brick on the ground floor. Wilst the interior was refitted in the inter-war period and retains a panelled island bar counter, the rest of the fittings are 'faux' according the the landlord of some 30 years.  This includes the panelling around the walls and the top sections containing mirrors and other decoration. In the dado panelling are small 1930s brick (painted red) and wood surround fireplaces (disused) on the rear left and front right areas.  \r\n\r\nThe skylight at the rear left has some colourful stained and leaded panels as does the door to the ladies. The screen / baffle by the front door and another two short pieces attached to the wall on the left are 'salvage' pub doors (locks and handles still in place!) for effect only. There is the odd bell push in the panelling. The island bar back looks wholly modern and fridges have replaced the lower shelving and the pot shelf is a much later addition. The cornice around the room looks to be from a date earlier than the refitting. The gents retains its 1930s Oates & Green three-bay urinal.",

The bar back fitting is of old shelves on a mirrored back with a \u2018Charringtons\u2019 illuminated top section and as Kemp Town Brewery were taken over by Charrington\u2019s in 1954 this is likely to be an original feature; only a small piece of lower shelving remains On the walls all around the room are strips of panelling and there is no fixed seating or signs of a fireplace. In modern times a doorway has been cut into the rear wall to the right of the servery to access the passage and toilets; also, in the same area, a doorway has been cut in the right hand wall for staff to access the servery in the right hand bar (and the original access off the passage is now out of use).\r\n\r\nOn the right is a larger room now the function room with a parquet floor and carpet on part. It retains its original bar counter of curved oak panels laid horizontally but has been painted a light blue colour and has a modern top over the original.

The owner wonders if there was a petition to get the pub its license in the 1950s? It is name after St Margarets Well which is 42 metres deep and is situated in the gardens. \r\n\r\nThe main beamed middle bar has a carpet, a wooden bar front with a shelf on the customers side which is something seen on bar fittings of the 1950s/60s, the bar back consists of shelves on a rustic wood and mirrored back and could well date from the 1950s; half of lower shelves lost to fridges. There is a large brick and stone fireplace with a very c.1960 copper hood over a log fire. Good benches for seating which could well have been here since 1956. Surrey Pubs (1965) states the beer was drawn from the cask and there is area on the rear left of the servery where some of the wood looks more modern so this may be where originally the casks were situated? \r\n\r\nA doorway leads to a smaller bar on the left which has its own front door entrance into this heavily beamed room. The curved wooden bar counter may well date from the 1950s, the bar back is another of shelves on a rustic wood and mirrored back. A brick fireplace with stove has another very c.1960 copper hood over it. Dado panelling near the front door is of a 1950s style, look for the adzed wood pillar and there are more good benches. \r\n\r\nOn the right twin doors with leaded panels lead to the Falstaff, a beamed dining room. This has a quarter circle wooden bar counter that could date from the 1950s. There is a brick fireplace with a log burner and a very c.1960 copper hood over. There is a small conservatory-style extension to this room to the rear which is the only significant change to the interior layout. \r\n\r\nThe lobby between the main bar and dining room with one wall of unusual timber has the toilets off \u2013 the toilet block and cellar on the right hand side where the only significant changes made to the exterior to convert it into a pub in 1956.

This multi roomed village pub appears to have fittings from the 1950s - Boscastle Manor Estate sold the freehold of the Napoleon Inn in 1946 so the changes could be shortly after that date. The main bar is the former Saloon Bar and has an old Delabole slate floor, a slatted wood counter (top may be a replacement), old fitted seating, a large old stone fireplace, also a hatch/small bar on the left of the main counter with a door for staff and with an old tongue and groove frontage. It maybe that service was from the left hand small bar and the main bar counter added post-war? \r\n\r\nThe room on a lower level was two small store rooms and a passage (confirmed by floor markings) and converted into a small lounge with a Delabole slate floor, a couple of settles and a small stone fireplace with old stove. Up two steps is a very small room with an old Delabole slate floor that was the ladies' snug with a hatch so the counter with a stone frontage is a modern replacement. Up two further steps is Boney's Bistro, originally a private living room, now a dining room with modern floor. \r\n\r\nA passage to the right of the pub leads to 'Funs Bar' (named after Funny Phelps, a local who came here with his father in the 1950s) in an extension to the original building and is the public bar. It has a modern Delabole slate floor and a curved slatted counter. On the wall is a photo dated 1950 showing a lapped wood counter but it has 8 planks instead of the present 4 so the present counter is a replacement. The lower shelving behind the bar looks old but all the higher shelving is modern. The small stone fireplace looks to be from the 1950s but the two high backed settles are imports / modern. \r\n\r\nCasks of St Austell beers are stillaged behind the bar - the shelving above does not look particularly old. Outside gents' and ladies' (modernised).",

Then therewere only four home-brew pubs left (since then, of course, many more have sprung up). The original four remain in operation, but whilst the other three have had small periods of non-operation since 1971, the Blue Anchor has never stopped producing. An uneven passage runs from the front door and leads to the tiny early 19th-century brewhouse at the rear on two floors with the vessels on the first floor up an external stone staircase.  \r\n\r\nHistorical character abounds in the arrangement of rooms either side of a central flagged passage, and in the front snug and main bar. The main bar is on the right at the front and would have been two small rooms at one time but has been like this for years. The counter is some 50 (possibly 70) years old with a top replaced in the 1980s. The bar-back shelves are no more than 30 years old. The small bare wall benches and half-height panelling are old. Note the pump clips just state Blue Anchor Spingo but some four ales are sold, all strong starting with 'Jubilee' at 1045 and the most popular 'Middle' at 1050.  \r\n\r\nThe snug at the rear has a counter replaced in the early 1980s. It has a large, old stone fireplace. Left of the passage are three small rooms with the only old fitting being a stone fireplace in the first room. There is a separate skittle alley at the rear. The pub has expanded into the property next door offering accommodation and in 2005 a new restaurant was opened.",

The interior of the original building was two rooms but removal of sections of dividing wall mean they are now linked. \r\n\r\nThe right-hand main bar area has a boarded ceiling painted deep red and old-looking bar-counter which might date from 1936 with 1960s padded panels and the top has a noticeable slope. The bar back of shelves on a copper and half timbering backing i.e. 1960s, the lower shelves have Formica shelves. The fixed seating at the front is possibly from the 1930s but more likely post-war, the ply panelled walls are from the 1960s, the wood surround and large tiled fireplace looks more 1960s. \r\n\r\nThe former room to the left has out-of-scale stone inglenook fireplace and curving, canopied 1960s-style counter - originally it was only a plain, small room with no counter. It has been knocked through to the front lounge (the former doctor\u2019s). For more information Pat Plumbridge, whose family actually kept the pub from 1935 to 1964 and who is still a customer can be contacted on 01736 362402. Marginal Yes. (DG 07) \r\n\r\nThis only cuts the mustard if the 1936 area to the right is felt to be good enough. The main flaw of course is the opening out to the rest of the interior (which has nothing of real interest). There have been changes in the 1936 area itself. The heavy, small-panelled windows are recent. A framed 1965 magazine article about the \"bar ceiling museum\" shows the old windows with bigger frames (much more attractive) along with the original bench seating (now replaced by padded banquettes). The light pine panelling which covers most of the walls also looks newish. The bar counter and boarded ceiling are both good features but don't amount to sufficient to merit a full entry.",

The present bar counter dates from the late 1950s with a Formica top and replaced one which incorporated the post in the centre of the room. The mirrored bar back with shelves is old, but fridges are in the lower shelf area where up to 2001 there was a stillage of wooden casks.

The old photo does confirm that the old dresser than forms the bar back fitting sitting in an old fireplace was there in c.1960. The stone fireplace with a log burner is post war. Originally, this bar was a scullery / kitchen. \r\n\r\nThe heavily beamed dining room to the left of the coaching arch has a bar counter with a copper top so appears to have been added in the late 1950s \u2013 a photo on the wall of the dining room dated 1955 does not show the bar counter. \r\n\r\nThe front public bar saw changes in the 1970s \u2013 a photo on the wall shows what it looked like in 1952 \u2013 it was possibly two rooms in the past. It has genuine old beams, some old wood paneling with probably 1960\u2019s/early 1970's leatherette bench seating opposite the bar. The public bar has some old beams and some old wood paneling with probably 1960\u2019s/early 1970's leatherette bench seating opposite bar. The bar back is a bit of a hotch-potch with modern (cheap wood) kit shelves screwed onto an old copper panel. Counter top and front are mismatched wood so may have been done at different times. 1970\u2019s says the landlady. The oak floor was installed no more than 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt still retains outside gents and ladies (they have been modernised). The interior was refreshed in 2020 but this did not adversely impact on the historic features.  Anthony Payne, retainer to the Grenvilles of Stowe and the last Cornish giant, is said to have been born here in 1610.",

        "Description": "Excellent example of a small country hotel expanding into additional rooms and remaining traditional. Thousands of pubs remove walls creating a disappointing opened-up layout but here there are five separate rooms. The original pub layout consisted of the small bar near the entrance and the small rear bar then later a extension was added i.e. the large room and the small corner room with a parquet floor; a modern extension on the side road added the small lounge. \r\n\r\nThe original bar has a Delabole slate floor, the counter looks old but its position has been changed \u2013 it was originally diagonally across the room covering the small decorative cast iron fireplace \u2013 note the right hand part of the counter looks older and is angled. Bar top is a replacement, and the room has old dado panelling. The rear bar has an unusual small indented curved counter with a replacement top, old slate floor but is situated in a lobby / passage with an opened-up small room opposite where an old settle replaces part of the removed wall and has old dado panelling and two more old settles with a carpet over the slate floor. Bar back shelves are oldish \u2013 some have Formica on them. \r\n\r\nThe large room on the road side has another slate floor and carpet, brick fireplace on the far right might be from the 1950s, the bar counter looks 1970s, two more old settles. The small darts room on the corner has a parquet floor and dado panelling (age?). \r\n\r\nDelabole slate floors come from the nearby quarry, reputedly the largest man-made hole in Britain being a mile and a half in circumference.",

The servery had already assumed its present position by 1952 although it had in all probability been moved there just after the War, 1949/50, from a former position across the left-hand end of the room. The counter might have been put in during the 1970s, with the shelving improvised from a former drawer-unit. There are two additional rooms on a lower-level rooms at the left-hand end. The first of these was a former sitting room and it is thought the hatch to it was created in the 1970s. D. H. Lawrence stayed at the Tinners Arms in 1916 while looking for a cottage to rent. \r\n\r\nPanelled walls look old and the panelled ceiling is very old. 2 good stone fireplaces, screeded floor.

        "Description": "This Victorian pub was remodelled about 1935 and given a curved frontage to the street corner. The Corner House has a remarkably little-altered 1930s interior. Of two doors in the corner lobby one leads to the former off sales on the left (now used for storage) and the other to the main bar. This is L-shaped and is said by the licensee and regulars to have been a single space right from the 1930s: a photo of 1936 in the licensee\u2019s possession shows there was no partition in the area approached from the main entrance, despite what one might read from the spur of a partition and the ceiling beam. It also shows that casks were stillaged in the back fitting which has now been fairly substantially altered. The counter is original with sleek, smooth woodwork and a Formica top, at the extreme ends below the counter are little plates naming the pub fitters, Shapland & Petter of Barnstaple. There is a 1930s fireplace in one corner and the walls have fielded panelling to picture-rail level. There is a wood Shove Ha'penny board permanently affixed to the wall at the rear and the pub is a full participant in the local league. \r\n\r\nBehind is a wide hallway with more fielded panelling and a staircase to private accommodation. On the other side is a room called 'Garlands', after Tom Garland, licensee 1933-68, who would have overseen the changes. This has its own servery (with much original work) and more more fielded panelling. It also has an impressive inglenook fireplace with cushioned seats on either side. The gents\u2019 retains its original four Twyford Adamant urinals and tiled walls (the ladies\u2019 loos are modernized). At the rear left is the skittle alley.",

        "Description": "This village pub is said to date from 1675 and now has expanded into three cottages and six rooms. The star of the show is the front, right-hand room \u2013 the Kitchen Bar \u2013 at the entrance and this no doubt formed the original core in the days when there would have been no bar counter and beer was fetched from the cellar. It has fixed settle-like seating around the fireplace - one acting as a draught protector by the front door. The floor is an ancient screeded one, there are some old seating attached to the dado and an old bench. \r\n\r\nBehind this comes the Village Bar with the servery to the left (with touches of decorative half-timbering) and which also faces directly into a space which was clearly once a separate room: this another screeded floor, a couple of settles and three barrel tables. To the left is a former domestic room which is a now a restaurant: it has a quarry-tile floor and two curved high-backed settles have been introduced. \r\n\r\nNo-one can miss the distinctive character of the Globe. The exterior prepares one for this with its textured rendering, something that is almost overpowering within! This must surely be from a thorough makeover round in or around the 1960s such things were in vogue. A subsequent change is revealed in an old photograph in the pub looking back up the Village Bar: this round-arched window at the rear has been removed to create an opening the pool room and the right-hand wall has been opened out to what would have been a corridor: this may have been carried out around 1988 when the counter top was replaced. Beyond the pool room is the function room including a skittle alley.",

This unusual \"folly\" was reputedly built as a private house by George Ley following a spectacular win at gambling in 1690, the number of original windows, doorways, chimneys etc., each reflecting the component features of a pack of cards. four storeys to reperesent the four suites; thirteen rooms for the number of cards in a suit; fifty two windows, fifty two stairs, (fifty two doors?) and was supposedly built on ground measuring fifty two square feet. The shape was that of a house built of cards. The sundial has a date of 1752 and carries the initials \"GL\" of George Ley Junior. All the principal rooms have moulded plaster cornices, and good-quality raised and fielded panelling joinery survives throughout.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar has fielded oak panelling to picture frame height all around and a brick fireplace with carved wood surround all of which could date after new owners took over in 1933 and changed the name from the King\u2019s Arms; the toilet block was added in 1935. An old photo of the bar shows a plain 1930s counter front and mirrored bar back with 2/3 shelves with casks of beer behind. The present bar back of shelves on a mirrored back has changed. This room was no doubt original two, probably joined in the 1930s There is good plaster ceiling decoration in the front section. To the left there is a flagstone passage leading to a chunky wood bar counter possibly of the 1950/60s (?) and a bar back of similar age. There are a number of dining rooms one of which has a small counter which looks to have been there for some time, a skittle alley-cum-museum.  \r\n\r\nAccording to the listed description \"The first and second floors are unspoilt, with decorative plaster ceilings to the principal first floor room in the left-hand wing and to the through-corridor. Both corridors are panelled as is the central room on the third floor has a built-in desk at which Marie Corelli reputedly wrote \"The Mighty Atom\", a tale centered on Combe Martin.\" The Oak Room (now the office) has a door believed to be 500 years old. Some windows were bricked up to become \"Pitt's Pictures\" after the Prime Minister who introduced the infamous Window Tax in 1784. There are two Adam-style fireplaces in the upstairs rooms and fine window glass. As the toilets are upstairs it is possible to view the hall but no other rooms, a number of which are letting bedrooms.  \r\n\r\nThe pub closed in 1985 and this was followed by two years pf neglect, and vandalism when many of the original bar fittings were probably lost; then there came along Alan and Marion Furnifer who spent five years restoring it, reopening the premises in 1992? Michael Parkinson spent his honeymoon at the Pack o'Cards in August 1959. In 1987 an episode of the Paul Daniels Magic Show was filmed here.

The present bar counter and bar back fitting were imported in c.1985 - claimed to come from a branch of Barclays Bank. There are a number of fine old settles. No old fittings so not worthy of inclusion.",

Inside the great feature was the right-hand bar which was basically just as it was in Edwardian times. The counter and the bar back were original and what was particularly interesting was the little screened-off snug towards the rear. The left-hand part of the pub had a bar counter and bar back from a Bass Charrington 1960s refit.  \n\nThe screen that made this pub a classic was removed in 2005 sadly. The bar counters have been replaced - no sign of any of the 1960s fittings on the left side - possibly only the bar back in the right hand side bar is original making this a very marginal as a Regional Inventory pub as at 2007.",

The nearby bridge, built in 1437, was the lowest on the Tamar until the one at Gunnislake was constructed.  A seal leaded into the granite step as you enter the porch was reputedly given by Charles 1 for \"services rendered\". The public bar is the original part of the pub and has slate-flagged floors and painted rubblestone walls. The bar counter used to face you as you entered but a major remodelling in the 1950s saw it shifted to the side to create an island arrangement serving both bars - it's an excellent example of so-called \"publican\u2019s rustic\". The fireplace is basically original but had a lintel added during the changes. The lounge was created in the refit from former living quarters. The bar counter on this side is a rather ugly slatted and grooved affair and the fireplace, stonework and benching are all typical of the period. A restaurant beyond occupies a later extension but doesn't impinge.",

It has really old panelling, bar counter with a typical copper bar top of the 1960s and bar back shelves from 1964 and is well worth a visit. On the ground floor the Manor Bar is a room almost divided into two by a back to back fireplace - it clearly was two rooms before conversion. Note how the fielded panelling is different on the right and left sides and there is much carvings above and to the side of the fireplace. Copper hood on the fireplace could be 1960s work. \r\n\r\nA staircase leads up to the first floor - note the very 1960s red lettering on a white background, 'Tower Bar open upstairs' sign near the staircase and 'Tower Bar' illuminated sign. The room has loose furniture which could well date from 1964. In the corner of the room until 2008 there was a small 1964 bar with a copper top. An old door leads to the ladies' toilet at the rear right - the outside gents'. Kitchen, and cellar below it are in a separate thatched building to the right. \r\n\r\nIn front of this is a tower building of stone with illuminated 'Old Thatched Inn'  at the top claiming to date from 1271 which incorporates a wishing well where proceeds go the local charities.",

Customers wanting off-sales service would use the little hatch, now concealed behind doors to the right of the main entrance: it can also clearly be seen internally. Then in 1962 came a new-fangled bar counter to create a bit more order and separation of customers from the storage area. This was on the right-hand side of the building. Then in 1984 a new owner, Richard Knibbs took over and the current layout was adopted. The counter of 1962 was moved and survives to this day with its extraordinary, bulgy barrel-shaped slats.",

The real delights begin on the left with Nelson\u2019s Bar, a small snug, partly floored with stone flags and with a stable door hatch to the servery. Off this, down stairs beyond a pair of studded doors, a snug with loose furniture opens up. The Lounge Bar is at the heart of the pub was added in the interwar years. It has fielded paneling to the walls  and a wide hatch to the server where casks are stillaged. Beyond is the airy conservatory extension of the 1980s.",

        "Address": "The Square, Sheepwash, Sheepwash, EX21 5NE",
        "Description": "17th-century inn extended in mid 19th century by incorporating two former cottages. Locals say the present dining room was a former school and there was a milliner\u2019s shop within the present premises at one time. The main bar consisted of two rooms until the early 1970s \u2013 a snug in the lower area on the left and the larger area on the right which were then combined. In the middle of the room the counter probably dates from late Victorian or early 20th-century times and has a large mirrored bar back of many shelves: pleasingly the lower shelves are not disfigured by fridges as they are in so many pub these days. There is also a flagstone floor, an old stone fireplace, exposed beams and old wall seating. The high-backed settle has moved and was originally attached to the left-hand side of the fireplace. In the distant past the higher right-hand side was a tiny bar with a separate tap room on the right. The left former snug part retains the same old bar counter.  \r\n\r\nOn the far left is a dining room which was until 2007 a dining room and separate residents\u2019 lounge. From the main bar a short passage to the right leads to a small beamed lounge. Further on is the very small high-ceilinged 'Rod Room' - note the rack of waders placed upside down to dry - it has an old stone fireplace with bread oven possibly from the 17th century and a bar billiard table. Note the tiny angling shop selling fishing tackle etc. - the inn owns four miles of fishing rights on the River Torridge and, with some rented access to 10 1/2 miles of fishing salmon, sea-trout and brown trout.",

The stillage behind was also added in the 1950s - prior to that beer was fetched from the cellar. Until the 1970s the doors to the Main Bar on the right and Saloon on the left were off the inner porch - the left room one is still there behind the long case clock. These doors were blocked up and part of the walls taken out of both sides of the passageway to create the slightly opened-up layout we see today. There is a good old stone fireplace with a copper hood, log fire and old fireback. In the 1980s the cottage on the right of the pub was purchased and the third room created. The pub is run on very traditional lines with lunchtime food limited to pasties, sandwiches, soup etc. any cooking is done on an Aga Cooker - no microwave here!",

A part glazed partition wall separates the public bar from the passage. It was last changed in the late 60's when a large hole was cut in the panelling in the public bar to remove the hatch and create a bar counter. New bar back shelves added at that time, casks behind the bar removed, and the massive stone inglenook fireplace in the lounge was exposed. The bar counters, dado panelling and bench seating could date from the late 1960s and the brick fireplace in the public bar is inter-war. An old wide latch door leads to the lounge. Note the oak partition wall in the lounge - a feature of many of Devon's Church House Inns - (the kitchen is beyond it), carved beams, and a 200 year old mummified cat found in a nearby property is in a glass case in the wall. The pub does not open around Sunday Evensong 'for good manners' so hours are 12 to 5.30; 7 to 11! Marginal, but the best example of a little altered Church House Inn.",

It remained unspoilt as it was owned by Miss Audrey Lamb, who lived here all her life up to August 1992 (she died in 2009 aged 79). The original layout of passageway from front door to a hatch from where you originally ordered your drink and the small tap room on the front right; the present public bar on the front left was not in regular use - it was just a meeting room for the Sick Club that met monthly and meetings relating to the Widecombe Fair (held on the 2nd Tuesday in September and made famous in the folk song with its phrase 'Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all'). You can still stand at the door to the servery to get served where in 1993 a piece of elm was added to to create a flap across the doorway to place drinks on.\r\n\r\nA low doorway (all doors removed in 1993) on the left leads to the small main bar where in 1993 a bar was installed by knocking a hole in the wall to the side of the cellar and a piece of elm added as a counter top and modern panelling below. Beer is still served from casks on an old stillage - in Audrey's day only Draught Bass was served (and cider and wine) and the floor has been scarred from rolling the casks prior to placing them on the stillage. Within the servery/cellar the main shelf is modern as are some other additions. The floor of the public bar is a pitted concrete screed one and there is an old stone fireplace at the end of the room that until 1993 was covered up. The benches were added in 1993.\r\n\r\nThe front right hand room also has a concrete screed floor and old shutters on the windows. The brick and wood surround fireplace replaced an older one in the late 1930s - Audrey recounted to the locals that she helped her grandfather build it! One wall that backs onto the staircase to living quarters is completely panelled - now painted blue. On the wall is a set of 12 illustrations by Pamela Coleman Smith as her interpretation of Widecombe Fair - 500 copies were printed by hand in 1898 by Lamson, Wolfe & Company, Boston, New York & London - this is set number 138. The small rear right room  was originally Audrey's Parlour and brought into pub use in the late 1990s. It has a bare boarded floor but no old fittings. The pub still retains its outside gents' and ladies', but they have been modernised. A garden is accessed across a footbridge over a stream. The car park is in a field just south of the pub and across the other side of the road.",

More 'public bar' deep etched exterior windows. Just inside the bar entrance are two cast-iron columns with spiral decoration. It retains its original curved bar counter, original mirrored bar backs with a set of drawers on the right and on the left another bar back in Edwardian style added in the early 1970s which replaced a fireplace situated behind the bar! The good benches in the front rooms/areas are from a local church. The 'Bottle & Jug' exterior window panel remains.  \r\n\r\nThe partition between the public and private bars has a fine 'public bar' colourful stained and leaded panel and other colourful panels. The rear main bar has lots of 'Private Bar' etched windows (some are good replacements), a fine curved bar counter with decorative brackets, original top, good original curved at the front bar back fitting with a set of drawers and on the right another bar back in Edwardian style added in the early 1970s. Note the small mirror fronted cupboards at the top of both original bar back fittings. On the 1976 bar back fittings fridges have replaces lower shelves. There is another fine stained and leaded partition alongside the private bar back fitting with a 'Private' colourful stained and leaded panel in a sliding door; also another with 'Office' on the door to a room off the passage behind.

In the 1950s and 60s the Baronial room with skylight (replaced unsafe stained glass with stained wood) was Freddie Mills Pro-Am boxing gymnasium - note the old sign for the gym is high up on the wall of the room. The floor was raised in 1970s - note the low window sills which confirm this and note the Art Nouveau patterns in the windows in the lounge.  \r\n\r\nWonderful gents' with three massive original urinals including rare black and white mosaic tiling where your stand i.e. 6 of them, lots of colourful stained and leaded panels in windows. and there is partition around the 2 WC's and what looks like the original cistern. The main gents has been demolished and the land is now part of the car park.

The pub was massively extended to the left in c.1990 when a former cellar and garages were replaced by a brick extension to create the new lounge and dining areas. This has been done tastefully with some full height panelled walls and a couple of tiny annexes; the dado being formed from panels found in the roof of the garage.

Possibly two cottages joined together at some stage, but certainly unaltered basic floorplan since 1800's. A four-roomed pub of character little changed in 50 years. The original pub rooms were the Public Bar on the rear right (note the name on the door), which was served via a hatch, and the Smoke Room/Lounge on the front left which are joined by a flagstone passage. Then in c.1960 Strongs of Romsey created the present main bar in what was the courtyard; a further extension in the early 1980s added the rear left small room/area and has crude bench seating on stone bases. Present toilets date from 1980's and replace original outside ones. Front right room has been brought into pub use in recent years. \r\n\r\nA corridor on the right leads to the original public bar, which has a genuine flagstone floor, dado panelling with wall benches attached and a small counter with old front and a modern top. The small stone fireplace looks 50s (or later?) in fact all the fittings could date from the late 1950s as the panelling is similar to that in the lounge. Wainscoting round bar area put in by Harold Figgins, landlord from 1958-1960. The window on the left hand side originally looked out to the courtyard. \r\n\r\nA corridor on the left hand side leads on to what originally was the kitchen at the rear left hand side. There is now a main bar in the centre with a flagstone floor, bar counter and bar back shelves (some are modern), also wall bench seating all seem to date from the 1950s. (Reg Saville says bar counter and bar back date from 1930's and must have been part of the Public Bar.)  \r\n\r\nRoom on the front left originally the Smoke Room can be hired out for public meetings, used as breakfast room for B&B guests, and was restaurant area in 1990's. Now additional seating area it has fitted benches attached to a panelled dado and there is a stone fireplace, both could date from the late 1950s changes. \r\n\r\nThe room on front right hand side was village mortuary until 1943 (separate front door to street now  boarded up), then became licensees sitting room until mid 1970's, then pool room. Has wood beam ceiling, simple bench seating and stone fireplace. \r\n\r\nMuch information from Reg Saville (Museum curator at Langton Matravers and local historian) and Darrel Elford (licensee from 1972 - 1993  who purchased F/H from Whitbread in 1980's).",

Service was originally via a hatch which was replaced by the present bar counter in the 1970s and the bar back fitting looks like it could date from the 1970s.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear and slightly opened up from the passageway is the Reeve Lounge.

        "Description": "17th century building with original stone mullioned windows which up to 1930s was in use as a doctor\u2019s surgery. Its layout of three small rooms off a lobby bar makes it look like it has always been a pub and it still retains most of the fittings added at that time. In 1937 the original Ship hotel was demolished and the Matthews family of Wyke converted this property into a pub. Apparently Dr Harris's daughter married one of the Matthews family.\r\n\r\nYou walk into the main bar with a red and cream diamond quarry tiled area and opposite the bar counter is a small snug area formed by a floor to ceiling short partition of fielded panelling with fixed seating attached to it and the dado panelling. The bar counter has a front of fielded panelling and still retains its shutters which it is believed still work but no one dares to lower them just in case they can't get them back up into position! There is a mirrored bar back which looks like it could date from the 1930s - look for the handpump shaped corner struts on the left side and beyond it the 17th century dado panelling on the staircase and a newel post. Alongside to the right is another bar back fitting which might have come from the old Ship - the bell box on the wall opposite the bar counter almost certainly did with its four windows including a Jug & Bottle one, also Private Room, Saloon, Tap Room. Note also the brass plaque from the days it was a surgery \"A Wilkinson, MD, WJ Harris, MB\".\r\n\r\nTo the left of the main door a doorway leads to the snug with one side of high backed fitted seating from the 1930s, another old bench on the left and a small cast-iron fireplace. On the rear left a latch door leads to the bare boarded 'Whine Bar' served from a hatch to the left of the servery. It has a fielded panelling dado all around with some fixed seating attached and good carved wood surround fireplace. The quarry tiled area near the bar continues into a passage leading to the right and a small bar with a panelled counter and tiny fixed seating. In 19XX it was extended back into former cottages so there is another area on a lower level.",

        "Description": "A 16th/17th-century building, formerly a workhouse, this tucked-away pub has the atmosphere of a genuinely old and little-changed ale house. The front door leads into a part-panelled lobby with a flagstone floor that continues into the passage. At the end of this is a split door that suggests a former off-sales and acts as a serving hatch for the room on the right; the top part of this door is a rare multi-glazed section that can still be closed. As the passage continues to the right, it opens up to a flagstone-floored room with an old stone fireplace but which is likely to have come into pub use in later years. Left of the split door is the main bar, which was once two rooms. The front left area has a flagstone floor, old dado panelling with bare benches attached and a stone fireplace. The area in front of the servery was originally accessed from a door near the exterior door. On the counter is a set of 1959 Gaskell & Chambers Dalex hand pumps so the counter is at least that old. A doorway at the rear of the main bar leads to another small bar, converted from a cellar in 2014.",

D Co ... Fine Ales And Stout Wines And Spirits'. It has a three roomed layout and retains much from a 1930s refit as well as retaining one Victorian bar counter. The corner bare boarded small room has 'Saloon Bar' white on red leaded panels in twin doors and retains a bar counter that is possibly 100 years old and painted green, old dado panelling with wall benches attached but a modern stone surround fireplace with log burner. Note the Victorian water tap on the bar counter which is sadly no longer in working order.\r\n\r\nThere are many of these to be found in use in Scottish bars as whisky is the only spirit to benefit from a little water. Other taps can be found in England most notably at the CAMRA Heritage Pub the Victoria. London W2 which is still in working order.\r\n\r\nUp two steps to the rear is a very small snug with one panelled wall and is served by a hatch/doorway to the side of the servery. The bare boarded public bar on the left was originally two rooms - note 'Public Bar' in white letters on red leaded panels on the window either side of the entrance doors. It has an old, possibly inter-war bar counter also painted green but the bar back is modern. There is more old dado panelling. In recent years, this room has been doubled in size by combining with a room to the far left, possibly a public room but more likely former living quarters. There is old dado panelling and seating in alcoves on either side of an old fireplace.",

It is included in this guide having been refitted in 1958 (the date of the paintings over the bar). You walk into a wonderful hall with an uneven flagstone floor, inglenook stone fireplace with a date a date of 1938 and dado panelled walls of the same date with bench seating attached and murals above (the panelling on the left could be older).\r\n\r\nOn the left the door into the snug has a sign 'Smoke Room for Ladies and Gentlemen' on it, parquet floor, solid bar counter probably from 1938 but both it and the 1930s panelling have leather padding almost certainly added in the 1950s. A part glazed stone 1930s fireplace is covered by seating which along with the tables look as if they have been here since the 1950s. The bar back with its red Formica  shelving is from the 1958 refit with some modern additions. The 1930 panelled passage runs from the front door to the rear - note the telephone booth on the left still with a working call box, increasingly rare in these days of mobile phones.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rear lounge has a modern stone fireplace and the bar fittings are a mixture  of 1950s/60s and later.

The dado panelling and wall bench seating on the front and right hand side are also painted dark green. In recent times the render has been taken off the right hand wall to reveal bare brick. The very old bar back fitting is of two bays with three narrow mirrored panels and a gilded decoration in relief - a third bay is a doorway for staff. There is a further section of mirrored back fitting on the right hand wall which is of a different design and added at a letter date.  \r\n\r\nInner doors lead into a passage that runs down the left side of the pub and on the right is a split door that may have been the off sales. This area has been enlarged by removing the wall between what was probably a private passage to the left and has an old looking panelled dado and wall bench. The private passage would have run all the way down to the rear so the other rooms are now much larger than originally.  \r\n\r\nDoorway leads into the bare wood floor rear bar with an old counter but with much plainer brackets than the front one so maybe from the inter-war period? The bar back fitting is old with the top part held up by brackets and covered in tat. The panelled dado painted dark brown looks old.  \r\n\r\nThe rear bar was the extent of the original pub but in the early 1980s a sympathetic extension saw the creation of another bare boarded room with fixed benches - the left hand side being an alcove created by a partition wall. There is a good long narrow table on the right hand side. Up two steps is another bare boarded room with a panelled dado painted dark brown and beyond this a patio area.",

The remarkable survivor here is the Victorian low screen which is attached to the ceiling with an iron stay situated to the right of the public bar. It creates the small snug known as the Captain's Cabin with its 'Private Bar' etched and frosted panels, which also appears in the twin entrance doors. One of the 4 panels is a transfer - can you work out which one?\n\r\nPossibly before the 1920s there was no counter in the private bar as the small curved one is different in style to the main bar counter. There is bench seating attached to a dado of tongue and groove panelling throughout the pub - some, notably in the public bar and on the back wall, may date from the 1920s rather than Victorian times. On the far left is a small area that would have been a separate room in the past. Note the wooden shutters on the exterior windows.",

In the passage at the rear note the off sales hatch in the door to the back of the servery.\n\nOn the rear left the skittle alley is a result of an extension (either inter-war or post-war?) - note the stone fireplace of 1930s design and dado panelling in the front section. It was built as a double alley but nowadays only the left one is in use. There are two hatches - one with an old counter and sliding screen and another more like a small bar with a black Formica top that looks a later addition. The pub is under threat of redevelopment so visit it soon.",

There is a passage from the front door to the rear with the intact off sales hatch half way along. On the left is the small lounge bar with dado panelling and wood surround fireplace which look like 1930s work (but could date from the 1950s). The bar counter could also be 70 years old and has a Formica top (so it could also be 1950s work); the bar back with its small glass pieces looks more 1950s than 1930s; and fixed seating could be 40+ years old. At the rear left is the public bar with a 1920/30s stone Tudor shaped fireplace (or is it one of the Minster concrete fireplace added to pubs by Stroud Brewery in c.1950?). The bar back could be 1930s or 1950s; the fixed seating could date from the 1930s or later but the bar counter looks more 1970s. Note the folding seat for staff in the servery area.\n\nThere is a good old skylight and a strange small section at the rear - was this domestic in the past? On the right is a small bar which nowadays is only brought into use for Cheltenham Races week and for funerals! It has a bar counter which was added for the first time in the 1980s.

The front left 'Smoke Room' has a red quarry tiled floor and the counter is at least 50 years old. It has lost its partition wall - there was a door into the room near the bar - but an antique settle and some timbers now make it look like a separate room. The 'Public Bar' on the front right retains most of its partition wall - markings on the quarry tiled floor show that it is some two feet shorter. This small room has a tongue and groove ceiling; dado panelling at least 50 years old; and an old settle and basic bench.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next room on the right of the original passage was the living room and has lost its partition wall as indicated by the markings in the quarry tiled floor. This room was brought into use possibly in the 1950s when the cellar on the left was converted into a servery and a bar counter added for the first time - the disused door next to the servery still has the word 'cellar' on it. Casks are still on stillage in the servery/cellar and beer served 'by gravity'. On the right is a range fireplace, a tongue and groove dado with wall benches - the two scrubbed tables and two low basic benches add to the atmosphere. Beyond the servery an extension added in 1988 with flagstone floor, solid bar counter and bar back shelving actually looks like it has been part of the pub for much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA further conservatory-style extension was added in recent years. Note the interesting topiary includes a yew tree cut out with two seats inside and the 'West Country Ales 1760 'Best In The West' ceramic wall sign. Still retains its outside gents'.

The brick fireplace dates from a similar time and the fixed seating was added in 2003.

The other two cottages became the lodgings for the \u2018leggers\u2019 who took the narrow boats through the tunnel, as there is no tow-path. The pub was renamed in 1955 after a successful horse owned by the wealthy bookmaker from Stroud who owned the pub from 1955. The cottage that is the present small public bar is on the left. It has a c1955 counter with a red Formica top and bar back shelving that looks like it dates from the c.1955. This bare boarded room has a large old stone fireplace, a piano and the pub game of quoits. There is a traditional gents' to the far left. In the middle of the pub is a small room that has a tiny counter/hatch at least 50 years old with no dispensers. This was the original lounge and beer was original served from casks behind the bar here. This room has a classic 1950s tiled fireplace with a fine bevelled mirrored mantelpiece, a settle and window seat. In 1955 the pub was brought from Simonds Brewery. It was then that the magnificent carved wooden fire surround was introduced to replace a range fireplace in to what became the present lounge on the right. It came from a large manor house in or near Stroud that had been destroyed. The lounge has a bar back with red Formica covered shelves that means it could also date from 1955; the bar counter is difficult to date and may be 30/40 years old.",

This room is significant for its magnificent early C17 plastered (leather?) ceiling with 3 rosettes, a dolphin, and a rosette in geometrical surround, also a plastered dragon-beam with a soffit of leaf and rosette. A fairly plain room, the other old fitting is the small Tudor arch stone fireplace. Note the good etched top panels in windows here and elsewhere featuring a bear and also on the two panels in the door to this room. The present bar assumed its position in the mid-1980s and you can see the counter front utilised old panelling from elsewhere in the pub. Until the 1980s there was a second bar in the room on the far right of the pub.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis half-timbered room has a vestibule entrance with leaded glazing and the fitting of note is a very fine 17th-century carved overmantel and surround to a stone fireplace. Huge oak beams and etched windows add to the atmosphere. The near right-hand room with a small Tudor-arch stone fireplace was used as a store prior to the 1980s and was believed to be the site of the original coaching arch. To the near right is another small room with a disused brick fireplace painted pink. In 1999 the pub was extended to the rear left when the owners bought the adjacent Tewkesbury Rugby Club and created a new bar (though this area is largely invisible from the older front part). The pub has therefore undergone a fair degree of change with all the original bar fittings removed in the 1980s, some opening out and new doorways being created.",

The original plan was the small public bar, off sales in the passage behind and the lounge at the rear which is now the bee  cellar, all on the ground floor. The small public bar retains its splendid original decoratively carved and mirrored bar back with a small return in the corner. The upper shelves are held up by slender columns with decorative capitals and below about two-thirds of the old bar shelves survive (the remainder removed for a fridge). The bar counter is also from late Victorian times and has decorative brackets. There is old dado panelling all round and oldish benches around the windows. The fireplace looks old but has modern tiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n In the passage behind the servery you can still see the original off sales hatch with two small leaded windows. Unisex toilet on the ground floor. There is also a cellar bar with several vaulted rooms, but no old fittings. Upstairs is a small pool room brought into use and another room converted into a kitchen.",

The Inn occupies a handsome mid 18th century building with early/mid 19th century stabling and brewery attached. It is situated on the main coaching road from Bath to Gloucester and horses were changed here. The inn had its own tokens for use as money. Its little altered interior owes much to the Harper family who ran the pub from 1920 until 1977 when Tom & Grace retired. In April 1942 the pub was machine gunned by the Nazi\u2019s. In 1832 mineral waters were discovered and in 1834 the Larkhall Spa was built. The inn become a popular meeting place for gentry who came to take the waters. The spring dried up in 1930. \r\n\r\nThe internal features of interest date from late Victorian times. You enter by a small intact vestibule entrance from this period with quarry tiled floor, twin doors ahead with floral symbols cut into frosted glass with the figure \u20188\u2019 over it. Also a narrow door and fixed panel on the right with the figure \u20186\u2019 on the door but both doors lead to the same space now \u2013 a largish public bar, a room which, whilst large, always seems to have been one space. \r\n\r\nSitting on the Victorian bar counter are three (non-operational) brass handpumps inscribed \"Nathaniel George Wilcocks City Inn Works Bath\" and said to date from 1887. There are various bar back fittings and shelving, most of which are of more recent age. On the left are shelves on a mirrored back held up by columns and painted dark yellow (nicotine strain?) then next is a doorway for staff then a cupboard with a glass front and drawers below, also painted dark yellow and on the right another old bar back fitting \u2013 the top mirrored back part is not painted and may be a later addition, lower shelves are painted with Formica on the main middle shelf. \r\n\r\nLook for the old gas fitting on the right of the bar back. There is a parquet floor, old dado panelling with window seating in the front part of the room. The front portion has a boarded ceiling whilst the back section has a higher ceiling with ornate plasterwork round the edges. There is a large original stone fireplace and two fine lengths of old bench seating - a curved one around the bay window of a style like an old settle but much wider and a straight section that forms a passage on the rear left to the ladies\u2019 upstairs and the outside gents\u2019 under cover. \r\n\r\nSadly, to the left of the entrance, there has been opening out into a lower level area with some wooden railings added later to reduce the gap to a doorway. This small room has a wood block floor, panelling to two-thirds height with wall benches attached, which look post-war as does the stone fireplace; and an even lower ceiling here. Further back on the left more tampering has taken place to create an open staircase and an entrance to the ladies loo. Note the old partition / draught screen opposite the counter by the door to the private quarters.  \r\n\r\nSmall pool room at the front right has a parquet floor and hatch for service \u2013 in recent years it has lost its door with \u2018Glass Room\u2019. On the rear right the kitchen has old wood block floor and a half door so may have been a public room in the past.

These include the arms of Edward IV; St. George's Cross; the third is unattributable. The original plan shows two rooms on the left of the wide flagstone passage from the two magnificent studded oak front doors; two narrow rooms on the right; and a newel staircase on the rear right which is still in use to access the bedrooms on the first and second floors. The landings have half-timbered walls and an exposed section of wattle and daub. \r\n\r\nThe present bar was a residents\u2019 bar (the public bar was behind it and is now a kitchen and dining room) and  occupies the front left and rear left rooms with wonderful oak walls on the passage side, and which have been joined together by removing a portion of the dividing wall, possibly in the 1950s (?). Old photos describe the front room as 'Abbots Parlour' and a later one as 'The Smoke Room'. The rear room is described as 'The Lounge' and no photos show the existence of bar fittings in the past. The counter on the rear left appears to have been added in the late 1950s with its distinctive copper features all along the front. The lower part of the bar back may date from a similar time but the carved upper super structure is more modern - possibly added in the 1980s (?). In the front section is an original heavily carved stone Tudor arch shaped fireplace, six section ceiling created by carved beams, front bay windows with stained and leaded panels including a number of colourful ones. In the rear section is a large inglenook fireplace with a central section of narrow bricks and lots of Delft tiling to the left and right of it; either side of the fireplace is some fielded panelling to two-thirds height - this seem inter-war work but in a display case there is a photo of this room in its present state but which claims to date from the late 1800s. \r\n\r\nThe walls either side of the flagstone passage are of thick oak. On the right the two rooms have been joined together and are used by drinkers and diners. Modern extensions at the rear of the hotel contain dining rooms, reception, toilets etc. The bar is open from 11 to 11 (12 to 10 Sunday).",

The top half of the bar back looks modern. There are small settles either side of the small old fireplace and there is a small leaded glass panel above the right-hand part of the seating. Off the lounge are small dining rooms to the rear left and right, brought into use in recent years. \r\n\r\nThrough a latch door and small passage to the right is the public bar with a flagstone floor, another old, possibly Victorian bar counter with the set of four cash register handpumps dispensing Butcombe Bitter and real cider. The small room has old Victorian bar back shelves, ancient range fireplace, old dado panelling, and fixed seating. Though a doorway to the right is another small flagstone floor (which was a mortuary at one time) with a small old fireplace, ancient wall cabinets, old dado panelling and an old bench. There are some fine settles throughout the pub. The car park is across the busy A431 road.",

The entrance lobby has old panelling and a colourful quarry tiled floor, which formerly led to the rear of the pub with a hatch for the off-sales on the right (photos held by licensee). In 1996 the passage was reduced to its present size and the doors with 'Jug & Bottle' on the glass moved to enable staff to serve the left hand room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the right is the public bar, a long room with some of the finest bar fittings in North Somerset - an impressive long carved bar-back with barley-twist columns, mirrored sections and a significant part of surviving lower shelving; also a fine early twentieth century counter. Other old fittings include the dado panelling with old narrow benches attached along the outer wall, facing the counter. There have been alterations here - the right-hand part with a small brick fireplace, which looks to be from the 1950s, is within one of the 'extensions' - but these don't detract too much from a very good room. There are 1930s 'bar' leaded panels in the right hand door. \r\n\r\n\r\nLeft of the lobby is a small lounge, which changed in 1996 when a new bar counter was added, the big stone fireplace is also from 1996, but the dado panelling is old. A short passage leads to a further room with gallery which was created in 1996 from a former stable. At the back, a terraced garden on several levels, and two petanque courts, overlooking the riverside park. Include for the public bar.",

The stone-built ground floor was built in 1397; and the timbered upper floors were added in the 15th century. What will put some off are the modern fittings - doors, bar-backs, possibly panelling, etc. But there are four rooms here in pretty well continuous use as an inn for centuries: the top two are used as a bar and lounge, the bottom two for dining. Structurally intact: thick stone walls, corridors; massive beams; enormous fireplaces; plus antique furniture. In the centre, a delightful, irregular-shaped cobbled courtyard overlooked by a gallery leading to hotel bedrooms. There is great history here, acknowledged by a CAMRA award. The modern fittings prevent this being considered for the national list, because the building really is of national importance. Include for its structure and history. Visited by Pepys in 1668. Revised description required after contact made with Wadworths asking for changes by them.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2014: A further visit reveals the present bar has only been in its present position for a dozen years - the original bar has been converted into a dining room. The lounge is little altered for some time.",

This isolated pub was run by Minnie Samford from 1917 to 1962. Up to 1968 there were two walls as you enter creating an off sales in front of you with a public bar on the left and on the right the landlady's parlour where the only invitees were the vicar and the tax man. Then in 1968 Courage opened up the pub and added a Formica top counter which was replaced by the existing counter in 1992. Note how the high backed settle has been moved - originally it was carefully placed to shield the log fire draughts and was attached to the ceiling by an iron rod. The rear room, originally a slaughterhouse, was created in 1992 and a bar counter added. Much info from former licensee Julian Litchfield. Certainly not enough old fittings remain to include  but may be worth a mention in an introduction \"How pubs in the West Country have changed\".",

The bar-back shelves are probably less old than the rest of the fittings. Two further rooms to the right have been knocked into one and have some old dado panelling and benches.

Door on the left with \u2018Bar\u2019 etched panel leads into the bare boarded public bar which is now one U-shaped room around an old servery consisting of a bar counter and bar back fitting on a screen projecting from the from wall. The old bar has a front where the tongue and groove was removed in 1996 (now forms part of the ceiling!) and replaced by parts of 17C French church doors.\n\r\nAn original part glazed screen forms part of bar back with shelves both ancient and modern attached. Full height wood panelling and bench seating is original (note the gap to the rear of the benches to accommodate tailcoats of gents using them!!) from unspecified date including benches attached to the back of the screen. There was originally at least one other partition wall to separate the rear section - look on the beam and you will see the figure \u20184\u2019 indicating where the door to the rear room was situated. Partition walls were removed in 1967 without permission! The presence of two medieval style stone fireplaces from c.1920 confirms it was originally two rooms. Bar has been altered, with a hatch door removed that originally served the rear room. Victorian stained and leaded glass panels by entrance door were added in 1996 by Ailsa and George Cuttell (tenants who took over a derelict, neglected pub in 1996, and whose expertise was in antique restoration - hence the mish-mash you see today).\n\r\nThe rear area has old dado panelling with an old bench attached to one piece and also church pews. Another bare room (used for pool) one step up at the rear of the bar with some old benches and beyond this is the kitchen. The room to the right of the passageway is the Shoot room, with old tongue and groove panelling installed in 1996. The blocked up entrance door was originally the main entrance to the pub. Green glazed brick, cast iron and wood surround fireplace from late 19C.\n\r\nOf most interest is the circular opening in the south wall with a 20 inch diameter metal tube that extends 43 feet down the inside of the building with a target at the far end. Said to be installed in 1903 to train locals in the use of firearms due to fears of German rearmament, it remains in use today as the pub has a team in the Devizes and District Miniature Rifle League which uses .22 small bore rifles.

        "Description": "Built 1937 of brick with herringbone brick and brewers Tudor first floor. It retains its layout of three rooms and the off-sales is intact but used for storage. The public bar on the left retains its original counter but the bar back fitting dates from c.2003. A lot of the original dado panelling remains with bare benches attached and a 1930s brick fireplace but painted cream. Originally you have to go out the bar door and back inside to get to the gents toilets, which have been modernised in 2001, and you can still see the original gents door in the porch. The ladies in the public bar may be a later addition. The lounge on the right was two rooms - it was joined with the dining room in 2001 by the creation of three openings. Although the counter looks original it has been turned through 90 degrees (and is of a different design to that in the bar) but the bar back fitting dates from c.2003. All around the front of the lounge is 1930s fielded panelling and there is a 1930s brick fireplace on the right painted red. In the rear former dining room section there is another original fireplace which is of brick with a stone surround and a hatch to the kitchen. Taking a closer look at the exterior of the lounge and there would appear to have been three doors with the middle one blocked up so possibly there were two rooms at the front? One door on the left hand side of the building has a 'Hotel Accommodation' sign on it.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2014: Converted by Adastra Pub Co. / Wadworths into a family steakhouse and few old fittings remain.",

There is a door with a ledge in the servery for staff which would have doubled up as an off sales and there are (sliding in the past) windows on the left displaying sweets for sale. Within the servery is an old stillage with a row of casks of real ales and above are old shelves, with more above the front partition wall of the servery. A small room on the left has a doorway, some old dado panelling with bench seating attached. Dado on the servery side looks modern. There is a hatch with rising panels in open position but on the servery side it looks like a display case.\r\n\r\nRight of the passage through an old latch door is the main room with a lapped wood counter and Formica top which dates from the 1950s and replaced a hatch, a large old fireplace with a 1950s brick interior, old dado panelling and lots of tools and implements on the walls and fireplace. The passageway leading to a further small room on the far right has the outline of a former bread oven in the brickwork (dating from when the premises acted as a bakery many year ago), formerly a private sitting room, has been brought into use in the 80s, and has some modern dado panelling and there is a small conservatory extension on the front far right. The pub still retains its outside gents (modernised) on the far end of the building. Closed Sunday evenings; closed Mondays in winter.",

        "Description": "Very much a country pub of brick and thatched roof (and porch) construction of c1800, originally two cottages, then a school before becoming a pub; certainly by 1901 when it was called the Maple Tree. The original entrance in the middle of the main building led to a living room on the left hand side (now the kitchen) with a kitchen to the rear left hand (now a pub room) whilst to the right hand was an entrance door (long since boarded up and now part of the wall) to the bar.  There was a further room to the rear, now accessed by the very narrow gap by the bar (created by knocking a hole through the wall in 1960's), with a separate entrance at the rear.  The right hand lounge area was the village shop (single storey with slate roof) until the mid 1960's when it was incorporated into the pub.  This now forms the main entrance to the pub. \r\n\r\nThere are now four small rooms. Entrance through right hand lounge single storey former shop, with red tiled floor and access to bar, created in 1960's. The small bar counter is of no great age. In the 1970's furniture comprised old sofas from local houses but now has bench seating more recently acquired. Doorway to public (original main bar) with red and black tiles in diamond formation. Original brick open hearth fireplace. Seating utilises former church pews and wooden tables/chairs acquired within last 15 years. Servery much altered with some old shelving but most dating from 1980's. Real ales on stillage. \r\n\r\nThrough a gap to the rear bar with red floor tiles, a couple of old benches, table and chairs from various times. The small cast iron fireplace is Victorian. This small room shares with the front main bar a bar counter that was installed in c.1960. Fourth small room at the rear right, originally the kitchen, still has a latch door and has a brick fireplace that looks like it could date from the 1950s (and possibly replaced a range fireplace?). Fixed seating could be of similar date. The hole in the wall was created in 1960's (Whitbread tenure) to ensure all room space could be viewed. Outside toilets replaced in c1990 with the new block at the rear with adjoining corridor.  There is an interesting tiled mural, created by Keith and Margaret Parker in 1990 recreating the Cuckoo Inn Cricket Tour of 1932, and features a period open top bus, characters in period dress, and the notation 'sponsored by Henry Wadworth's Old Brown Ale'. The dado match-boarding throughout was installed in 2000/01 to cover up, and help prevent, rising damp. The building has no foundations or damp course, and the provision of panelling both covers up, and helps prevent, the problem.",

Some old dado panelling, window seating and fitted seating. To the right is a small bar that was a meeting room until the mid 1980s. A cut through the wall of double door width made. Licensees got a local craftsman to add the quarter circle bar in the style of the main counter. The fixed seating is possibly more 1930s than 1980s.",

This is one of only a handful of pubs where you can still witness 'beer being drawn from the wood', as few breweries still use wooden casks. The room has some old, possibly early 20th-century benches and a scrubbed table. gaps either side of a modern open brick fireplace lead to another room with similar inter-war counter and another fine mirrored bar back with shelves held up by slender pillars. The fixed seating here looks to be from Victorian times but re-upholstered. A doorway leads to a small rear room with another inter-war counter and more modern fireplace.

The semi-partition on the street side of the bar, dividing the space with the main bar counter from the long arm of the L, is old with white painted wooden panelling which forms one side of a surviving vestibule. A modern, trellised partition has been added more recently above, and extending slightly beyond, the bar.  n the centre of the long arm of the L is a fire-place and old chimney (no longer in use) effectively constituting another partial division of this space into two, with a wide gap between the fireplace and the corner of the counter. The fireplace just mentioned faces into the \u201cheel\u201d of the L, meaning that each of the former spaces would have had its own fireplace, although there appear only ever to have been two external doors. The pub has wooden flooring throughout. \n\nThe main bar counter appears to be inter-war with wooden panelling: the recessed rectangular centre panels have been painted white, but the bars separating them are varnished. There is surviving wall panelling, largely painted white, and wooden fixed seating with unusual spindled legs, which extends into an alcove to the left of the fireplace. This large and apparently very old fireplace and hearth is now unused. A (1970s?) mural of a stone circle with a celtic-style wreathed border has been painted on the chimney breast. Similar wreathed patterns decorate the ceiling beams.  \n\nAt the end of the long arm of the L there is a bricked-up fireplace with wooden surround that could be inter-war. There is also surviving fixed seating in this area in the form of a settle-type unit. Some leaded windows survive, although some have been replaced by modern imitations. The short end of the counter which faces into this area is of similar style and age to the longer counter in the base of the L. Fixed seating survives also in the space in the heel of the L, with a mural apparently of Stonehenge, above the small disused fireplace. Panelling in these two areas is painted white below the dado, varnished above it.",

Incorporated with the saloon bar in the 1970's but there is a wooden folding partition which can separate it. Owned by the local Estate until sold in 1954 and acquired by the present owners in 1969 who made some changes to the bar back fitting in c.1970 but little has changed since.\n\r\nOn the left is the public bar with a large old inglenook fireplace of stone and the bar counter of fielded panelling looks like an inter-war one but is more likely post-war. There is a Gaskell & Chambers beer engine with side handle on the left of the counter \u2013 only a half a dozen remain in use in the UK \u2013 which the landlord says dates from 1947, which may well be the date of the bar counter. The rare handpump probably still works but the landlord prefers to fetch the beer from the cask to keep it in the best condition, due to the amount of trade. The bar back fitting with its 1960s backing of small glass pieces and with Formica shelves was installed in c.1970 and has a small till drawer. There is a very long high backed settle between the counter and the fireplace and another antique settle.\n\r\nThrough a sliding door of 1960s ply panels is a larger saloon bar original large flagstones and another fielded panelled counter assumed to be just post war. There is a stone fireplace, a narrow high-backed settle, a stool made from a wooden barrel, two-person cane seat, table skittles ready to play and darts. Through a folding wooden partition that is always kept open is a room brought into pub use in c.1970. It has a c.1970 wood block floor, 4 antique settles, false plastic beams to give it an 'old feel' - according to the Landlord and houses a pool table. Windows and doors are early 1970's replacements.",

The fascia board of decorative character was added in 1959 (source; Grade II Listed Building description). The public bar at the front right has a sloping bar counter with unusual frontage and a copper top that was presumably added in the 1950s; the bar back is a mixture of old and new shelves. There are some small seating bays on stone bases, small round tables have copper tops and panelled ceiling. On the left are more seating areas, a brick fireplace with carved mantelpiece (another wrecked ship item) and nautical artefacts everywhere. Through a doorway are more seating areas and a door with coloured glass panels which leads to a passage from which you can access the Great Cabin or go upstairs to the Wreck Bar. \r\n\r\nThe Great Cabin is a spectacular themed room, an intact reconstruction of the interior of a sailing ship, utilising fittings from wrecked ships to re-create the aft cabin of a Privateer, though there appears to be some later 'standard' items of bench tables and seating. It is relevant to note that this room is laid out as a restaurant and used as such in the summer season. In winter it is only used for occasional functions, but at quiet times ask the staff for permission to view. Upstairs there is the Wreck Room which is again only used in the summer season, the rest of the time being used as a store room. Artefacts and trinkets are not set out in any order or theme. At the front of the first floor is the Lady Hamilton Bar accessed via a staircase just inside the front door, or through the Wreck Bar.",

        "Description": "Stone built pub situated on the edge of Bradford-on-Avon with an unspoilt public bar and extended lounge. The lobby has bare seating and the front door leads into a tiny area with a blue brick floor in front of a hatch / split door for staff, formerly the off sales with a new bar top, and old dado panelling painted orange. Door on the left with the figure '1' on it leads to a splendid small public bar or snug with a bare wood floor, very old dado panelling painted orange with bare benches attached, a baffle/draught screen by the door and window seating. There is a heavily pitted bench with a small baffle under the dartboard. The central servery has a counter front with a ribbed hardboard frontage so it may have replaced a hatch in the 1950s; the bar back shelving was added in the late 1990s to replace shelves on a mirrored backing and there is an early 20th century light brown tiled and wood surround fireplace. Note the old spice cupboard on the rear wall of the public bar. \r\n\r\nOn the right a part glazed door with the figure '2' on it leads into a two-part lounge with old dado panelling painted a deep red, service is via a hatch with two small windows always open and Formica  top. The old stone fireplace has signs of a bread oven and now has a wood burner; the floor is of wood laminate. In the top left hand corner is evidence that a staircase has been taken out, no doubt at the same time as the remodelling which removed the back wall. The room is therefore now open to the dining room at the rear in an extension added in the 1990s, which also saw the toilets brought inside. On the left of the public bar, the old kitchen is now the card room with modern dado panelling painted deep red, a latch door, an old disused brick fireplace and a single oval table.",

The former description is shown below. \u2028  \u2028\n\nEarly 1900s pub of brick and stone still retaining original bar fittings. The vestibule entrance has three doors which may have originally led to an off sales in the middle and bars to the left and right - a partition remains with the lower part being old but the top section looks modern. The splendid original mirrored bar back remains with shelves held up by columns with capitals and decorative brackets on the lower part. The bar counter looks to be the original with its brown stain removed and a modern elaborate pot shelf on top. Both bar areas have a parquet floor, and on the left is a small 1930s brick fireplace. Originally there was a third small room on the right but this was absorbed some time ago. On the door to the room upstairs are the words 'Club Room' but this is no longer in public use.",

        "Description": "19th century stone building (source English Heritage listed building description \u2013 the pub claims 1752). The building to the south of the pub is called the \u2018Town Hall\u2019 and was built by the landlord of the New Inn as a function room, rather than a municipal headquarters. Between 1862-1931 the Magistrates Court was held here The old portico on the front of the pub is said to have been moved from the \u2018town hall\u2019 next door in 1932. Front door leads to an opened-out corridor with the bare boarded public bar on the left, which is little changed. \r\n\r\nThe public bar has a Victorian panelled bar counter with brackets all along it \u2013 look for the slotted brass plate in the counter top is believed to be for the tokens issued by the owners of the local copper mine. In 1932 the Rashleigh Estate sold the pub to St Austell but it came with a covenant which required it to sell draught Bass in perpetuity and the beer is still sold these days from casks on a stillage behind the bar counter. A model of the interior of the pub shows the stillage was originally all the way along the back wall. The bar back shelves above the stillage are 1990s replacements and the mirrors date from 2005. \r\n\r\nThere is full height old panelling painted black around the servery which extends as far as the fireplace and there is an old panelled ceiling above the servery area. If you look up at the ceiling there are signs that a partition existed on the right hand side providing a small separate serving area in the distant past. On the left the fireplace is a 1950s tiled one with a log fire and there are good old benches. \r\n\r\nA wide doorway on the front right leads to the small smoking room, the opening-up having taken place c.1976. It retains a 1930s wood surround fireplace. A door with the figure '4' on it leads to the rear bare boarded passageway which has a door at the rear of the servery with a ledge \u2013 this was the off sales no doubt accessed from the exterior door at the end of the passageway. Sadly, the top split door was removed recently but look for the working gas light near the off sales hatch which was used in recent times during a power cut. \r\n\r\nOn the rear right the music room has a figure '2' on the door and until recently had a bar counter which was added in the 1970s. On the rear left is a Bistro room brought into use in recent times.",

The 1990s saw the removal of part the wall to the rear was removed to join up with the room behind (this has already  had an extension in the 1930s, hence the Tudor-style stone fireplace): the dado paneling is post-war. \r\n\r\nThe off licence is a rare survivor being a very tiny space behind with twin doors and possessing a Victorian counter front and old panelling from floor to ceiling.

Run by long standing licensees it retains a number of rooms and genuinely old fittings. \r\n\r\nLeft hand exterior door is no longer in use. Entering the right side entrance, you have the bar area to your left. To your right is what used to be the parlour. Both areas have fixed seating with red as the theme of colour. You are standing in what was once a passageway leading to a bottle & jug then two rooms at the back. The walls separating those as well as the front two have been removed. (Customers estimate those went in the 1970s, before the current landlord moved in.) The bar counter has diagonal-patterned wooden panelling (with red worn paint) on its face, with consoles along its front. From plans, the counter appears to have been shortened and moved to the left hand wall or just shortened. (There is no immediate indication of it having been cut at the right-hand end.) The end has no consoles. Note the rare old Draught Bass dispensers with mirrored fronts that are still in use. \r\n\r\nThe first window of two sills in the bar has a bum perch built in. It appears to be what was the doorway before the pub was extended (from plans dated 1873) up to when it belonged to George\u2019s Brewery. Behind the servery is the barman\u2019s exit which also acts as a serving hatch. The lower shelves to the bar-back look very old but the landlord has said he fitted the upper shelving of the bar back i.e. the copper backing and glass shelves are modern and the cabinet is old with sides painted a deep pink.. \r\n\r\nWhat was the parlour (the front right-hand room) has a cast iron fireplace with some parts of the decorative patterns painted. On the floor in front of it are tiles about 2\" sq in size. As in the bar, the window frame is timber, with vent windows which lean inwards on metal stays when open. \r\n\r\nThis side of the public bar used to house a bottle & jug. Behind that before you reach the rooms at the rear, are passageways to both the left and right, both with dark green vertical timber panelling up to shoulder height. The one to the left called \u2018Bull Shit Corner\u2019 has a portable seat facing the serving hatch, with the same red upholstery as the rooms just described. Doorways down to the ladies\u2019 toilet and up to the landlord\u2019s accommodated are at the end. The right-hand passageway leads to the gents\u2019 toilet. Also, the stairway down to the cellars is housed in there. Note the figure \u20185' shows on a door of a small storage area down there which was previously a requirement of licensing magistrates. \r\n\r\nContinuing to the rear, you enter what used to be the smoke room (left-hand side) and tap room (right-hand side). The theme colour is green in these. Fixed seating surrounds the walls in the tap room. Seating against the rear exterior wall is additional to what shows on an 1873 plan. A cast iron fireplace stands here, looking rather grand with a large timber surrounding and mantlepiece. \r\n\r\nThe area to the left-hand side has a doorway to the beer garden with a duck pond. (Also in the garden is a pit which was once used for bear-baiting.) The doorway was once a window. A small modern gas fire stands adjacent to the exterior wall, surrounded by brick-shaped stonework. Some fixed seating appears here, but ordinary chairs, more. A shove ha\u2019penny table of unknown vintage also occupies the room.",

        "Description": "Uniquely designed pub due to its hillside position, it was built in 1965 and is remarkably little altered since. It was designed by H. R. Robinson, LRIBA, Group Chief Architect of West Country Breweries, which became part of Whitbread's in 1963. The pub had three bars - the public bar on one side, and the 'buttery bar' and lounge bar on the other which were originally separated by a partition but fully joined together. The plan of the pub as built was the result of a last-minute change of mind - there was originally going to be an off-sales shop and a larger first-floor terrace, but this was done away with and the buttery bar created. A buttery bar is a room that has been found to have existed (by that name) in only one other post-war pub. \r\n\r\nThe Bath & Wilts Evening Chronicle (Dec 1965) states \u2018In planning the house, West Country Breweries\u2019 architects were conscious of the fact that it occupied an exposed site facing north. To provide maximum comfort for the customers they have installed a unique system of pressurisation which is linked to the central heating and ventilating system. This provides for all rooms to be slightly pressurised so that draughts are completely eliminated. To provide extra comfort, all windows in the house are double-glazed\u2019. The Roman figurines on the outside and inside are all original parts of the scheme, and the fragment of Roman mosaic in the entrance hall is also likely to have been displayed in the pub since the 1960s. \r\n\r\nFrom the car park there is a lobby with a terrazzo floor with a skittle alley on the left and a store room on the right. The skittle alley with a servery was added into what was formerly a garage, empties store and the northern half of the cellar and bottle store around the late 1970s/early 1980s. A terrazzo staircase leads up to the entrance hall with numerous doors \u2013 one is to an office; another to the maisionettes upstairs, others to the toilets and to the two main bars. There is also an external staircase around the inn sign leading from street level to the lounge bar. \r\n\r\nThe lounge bar is on the left (west) side and near the entrance is a higher level for darts with a balustrade (age?) and the bottom segment of what was a tiered group of planters, joined by metal rods. The counter is the original and is of a distinct 1960s style with a Formica front and top. The mirrored bar back is intact including the lower shelving as fridges have been sensibly placed under the counter. The room has a carpet with terrazzo tiled floor near the servery. \r\n\r\nUp a step is an area formerly the Buttery which was separate from the lounge with a partition original. It has a suspended ceiling is of hollow steel laths. The original counter here is part panelled and part has a Formica front and it has a black Formica top. The bar back retains its lower shelving but the above section consists of cupboards and is now a glass washing area so some changes. Down the left hand side is a mirrored display case of trophies \u2013 this area originally was for serving food and has lost its bar counter i.e. it was L-shaped. The walls of the buttery bar are lined with timber panelling and it has large windows with views over Bath. \r\n\r\nThrough twin glazed doors is the public bar also on two levels with an original balustrade in the raised dart area just inside the entrance. The original counter front has raised  squares to which panels were added some 5 years ago. The original mirrored bar back fitting has a couple shelves in the upper section and only one fridge added. The room has a pool table and large windows having views over Bath. \r\n\r\nOff the entrance hall a door leads to the office with the original safe. The gents retains most of its original wall tiling (pink!) but the trough is modern. The ladies is untouched with more pink wall tiling and two cubicals with Formica covered partition walls.",

        "Description": "Victorian corner pub built in 1891 with some of the most ornate ceiling decoration in a pub in Wales; it still retains a rare Jug and Bottle Department. The public bar, accessed from Herbert Street, was originally two rooms and there was an entrance in the middle of the room. The bar back is original with some new wood and mirrors but another one on the right has been lost; the counter originally went all along the back wall but was shortened in 1962. This high ceilinged room has an impressive cornice featuring malt shovels, casks, and hops; large ceiling roses; impressive arches and shoulders, the latter two with detail picked out in green and purple.\r\n\r\nThe lounge, which is only open in the evenings, is accessed from the Barry Road mosaic floored entrance (WH = Witchill Hotel) - the mosaic floor continued throughout the hallway but is now covered by lino tiles. Formerly two rooms, the lounge retains its original bar back with two deep drawers, one used to store cigarettes, and the counter looks original. The rear part has bar fittings that mainly look from the 1960s but parts are older. There is another superb cornice of grapes and leaves and a 'Smoke Room' panel in the inner door. Between the two bars is the intact Jug & Bottle Department with an etched window, a wood and glass partition, two hatches and shelving.\r\n\r\nFor other impressive ceiling decoration take a look at the frieze and ceiling roses at Halfway Hotel, Llanelli; also the bracket over the fireplace at the Slaters Arms, Corris.",

        "Description": "The Old Arcade is one of the most famous rugby pubs in the world - it is well worth a visit to see a contrast of fittings with early 20th century ones in the front bar and some genuine late-Victorian fittings in the back bar. It is very busy when there is an event at the nearby Millennium Stadium, particularly rugby matches. It was built in 1844 as the Birdcage Inn; and later called the Arcade Vaults. In the front bar the counter looks like inter-war work, as does the wall panelling and there is a 1920s style fireplace. There are several doors into the front bar indicating it was probably sub-divided in the past. The remaining bar back is in a Neo-Jacobean style - note the little upright barrels in the decoration - it has been altered to incorporate a genuine Victorian mirror that was formerly on the wall of the lounge. Note the original 'Brains Beer' etched window.\r\n\r\nLater refurbishments give the pub a modern feel but it is good to see a city centre pub retaining many old fittings. The back bar retains this splendid late Victorian bar back fitting still with five of the six original mirrored panels; also a mahogany counter and an early 20th century fireplace. In order to fit in more rugby fans changes were made to the front bar in 1995. The counter was shortened, it was removed from the front of the room and now you are only served from the side. This change enabled a disabled toilet to be added but part of the old bar back fitting still remains.",

In the same family ownership for nearly 70 years, this thatched pub has been authoritatively dated to the mid 16th century and has a layout of six rooms around a central bar. However, it has only been like this for just over 50 years, when more of the building was converted into public rooms - the oldest items inside are the settles and 19th-century chairs. Prior to the early 1960s it consisted of just two rooms with beer served from barrels on a stillage. The snug at the front has a low stone doorway and ancient ceiling using horsehair. The front lounge has a modern counter and here you can see beams that were replaced following a major fire in 2004. The public bar situated to the right of the main door is the most traditional of the rooms with its flagstone floor, beamed ceiling, old inglenook fireplace and high backed settle; however this room has only been in use for just over 50 years, which is the date the bar fittings were added. A flat-roofed extension added in the early 1960s created the long bar and two rooms at the rear which have old settles. A restaurant accessed by a staircase at the rear was added in a further extension in 1984.",

        "Description": "Traditional drinkers\u2019 pub with three simply furnished rooms and an off sales hatch to the passageway. The sliding sashes still work and the off sales is still in use, mainly by children for sweets; also some customers use it for passageway drinking - note the shelves on the walls used by drinkers. In the wake of the 1831 Merthyr Rising, Richard Lewis, known as Dic Penderyn, was incarcerated in the cellar of the Lamb before being hanged at Cardiff for wounding one of the soldiers brought in to suppress the rising. It is now accepted that he was innocent of this crime. His last words from the scaffold were \u201cO Arglwydd, dyma gamwedd\u201d (\u201cO Lord, here is injustice\u201d).\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the pub was extended and the front door changed to the present one facing the main road. On the left with '1\u2019 on the door is the public bar where the counter has panels added to the front of an old counter in the 1980s and a top with an obvious slope; the red leatherette benches date from the 1960s. The bar back shelves were built in c.1965 by a previous landlord\u2019s son, who was good at woodwork at school! The lounge on the right has '4' on the door, Formica top tables and a bench from the 1960s. A stone flagged corridor runs to the rear with a Victorian service hatch for both off sales and use by lounge customers. Behind the public bar is the snug with '2' on the door, a stone flagged floor, fixed bare benches and a tiny hatch to the servery. Used as an office in recent years, this should be back in pub use by the date of publication. The door with '3' on it at the rear left is now a private room. Outside gents'.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for some real ale while in Penderyn then check out the Red Lion, which opens at 7 (1pm Sat, Sun). It is much changed since 1978 when they installed a bar counter for the first time. The only old fittings are the stone fireplace, a high backed settle with iron stay to the ceiling and which forms a short passage from the front door, and a 1920s bentwood bench.",

        "Address": "56 Wind Street, Swansea, SA1 1EG",
        "Description": "This is by far the most interesting historic pub in Swansea and was frequented by the young Dylan Thomas, one of Wales\u2019s most famous poets. Its origins are said to go back several centuries but the modern history of the building dates from the foundation of Munday\u2019s, a firm of wine merchants established in 1837 and which came to own many premises in Swansea. Here they had a wine shop, two bars and cellars all of which have left traces today and if you visit at a quiet time you can take a look around and see how a Victorian Wine Merchants operated. The front part was Munday\u2019s wine merchants shop and beyond the remaining third of a glazed screen and cast-iron columns that divided the shop from the drinking premises behind there are two separate old bar counters, which were no doubt in two separate rooms originally, and an old glass-fronted display cabinet. Entrance to these was from Salubrious Passage to the left of the building beyond the present, adjoining shop. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe pub now stretches back far to the rear where there is an apparently imported bar counter and on the first floor is Munday\u2019s Bar, open at weekends and for private functions. It is said that the unusual name is because the drinking room at the back of the shop was unadvertised. The cellars of the No Sign Bar, Swansea, with two parallel brick-arched areas divided by an arcade of cast-iron columns probably date back 200 years. The gantry crane on rails that would have been used to hoist and move heavy casks of sherry, port or whatever liquor Munday\u2019s were holding is an extraordinary survival. The cellars are now \u2018The Vault\u2019, a live music venue open at weekends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalubrious Passage appeared in Thomas\u2019s story ''The Followers\u201d renamed Paradise Passage \u2013 the nearby Dylan Thomas Centre housed in the 18th-century former Guildhall celebrates his life and achievements.",

The Salty Bar on the right retains a splendid pre-war mirrored bar back with a set of drawers and the bar counter appears to date from the early 1960s. The old photos show 1930s panelling on the left hand wall of the Salty Bar, but this has been replaced by 1950/1960s panelling.

As you walk in the original off-sales hatch is still there complete with sliding window, but the dado panelling only dates from the 1980s. The small snug bar on the left is a real period piece from c.1960 with its hardboard-panelled walls, small bar counter with a Formica top and small brick fireplace. The bar back shelves may be a later addition. In the bar on the right there is another c.1960 brick fireplace in which you will find an open fire in winter and there is a dado of more ribbed hardboard. However, the counter only dates from the early 1990s. Look for the Hancock's Brewery framed poster, and the ceramic huntsman on a barrel shaped horse, which is advertising material for the long-defunct Rhymney Brewery that closed in 1978 (A new brewery with the same name started producing real ales in 2004). Just beyond the ladies toilet there is a small meeting room, which has been brought into use. In the car park are a number of boules pistes and views of Celtic Manor Golf Club, venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup. A travelling theatre calls here one evening in both May and September to perform a play on the lawn.",

We can therefore highly recommend a visit to the 13th century Crypt Bar of Llanthony Priory. Deep in the two-bay vaulted undercroft, it consists of two distinct areas of character. The bar counter on the left is at least 40 years old and was slightly moved about 20 years ago, which could be the date of the bench seating in the form of settles, and there is some inter-war panelling on the walls. If you avail yourself of the accommodation (or book a table for a meal) you can drink in the splendid residents\u2019 lounge/dining room with a vaulted ceiling, early-19th-century range fireplace, and antique settle. As one would expect from such an ancient building you have to take a narrow 13th-century spiral staircase to the four bedrooms, one of which has a vaulted roof.\r\n\r\nCourt House Farm alongside the hotel has a campsite with basic facilities and offers riding for both experienced riders and beginners (01873 890359/ www.llanthony.co.uk).

The small front 'Studio Bar' had a bar counter installed for the first time in the early to mid 1960s, previously the room was served via a hatch. The wall between the 'Studio Bar' and the passage was replaced with a low partition at the same time. Panelling on the wall is of various dates and has wall bench seating attached; the fireplace looks 1960s. The second bar has a similar counter so was installed in the early to mid 1960s, the fireplace and all the bench seating is from the 1960s, but the flagstone-like floor is modern. The almost circular 'Gate Room', the old round tower, has modern panelling and floor. To the rear on a lower level is another small room with bare wood floor and old panelling that is now used as a dining room. The pub has been extended and includes a separate games room.",

The entrance in Alexandra Road leads to a terrazzo-floored lobby/reception with a dado of green tiles and Queen Anne detailing on the staircase. \r\n\r\nThe Smoke Room has an impressive ceramic bar counter - one of only eleven left in the whole of the UK. It is of Doulton fa\u00efence in five sections separated by columns with decorative capitals in deep yellow with floral tiled panels in bright blue. - only eleven remaining in the whole of the UK.

To access the large public bar an arch was cut into the dividing wall from the smaller smoke room in recent years; this leads to the large main bar and its original corner entrance has been blocked up. The terrazzo floor indicates there was a small separate room, possibly an off sales on the left side of the room. Again this retains its splendid original mahogany bar back lining two sides and another L-shaped ornately tiled bar counter. However, only half of the counter still remains, the other half having been removed and reputedly sold and shipped to America in the early 1980s.  \r\n\r\nNote the etched windows (some replacements) announcing 'Vaults' and 'Workman's Dining Room' - the latter being the room on the left of the entrance lobby which operated as a snack bar with 1950s fittings until the pub closed in 2002.

Popular with diners, the pub rooms were originally the two small ones on the right-hand side of the building beyond the fine shop front. The front door historically led to a passage to the rear of the building. The front right room was the bar and at the rear was a separate snug. The rear right area has markings on the ceiling which indicate the position of an antique settle that created a passage down the rear left side. Nowadays you will find an old bar counter placed across the passage in c.1960 and a bar back created behind it. The left bar was formerly two domestic rooms hence the range fireplace in the rear room indicating it was the kitchen in the past. The layout and fittings therefore only date back to the 1960s but the pub feels as if it has not changed for many more years.

The public bar has a splendid inter-war-style brick and timber bar that was actually installed in the 1950s and still retains its intact glazed shutters, but nowadays the lower ones are always raised. There is also a large stone fireplace with a log fire, an old settle, two very old pieces of bench seating, three old tables and a framed brass relief of a domestic scene. At the rear of the bar is a small quarry-tiled floor pool room.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the front stone porch you walk into a hallway/lounge bar with a bar counter added 30 or so years ago and a passage leads to an old reception hatch.

The small room has a black and red quarry-tiled floor, solid bar counter, bar back shelves and a large stone fireplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wall you will see details of the winners of some of the large array of events that are held in the town, including the Man Versus Horse Marathon on the 2nd.weekend in June; and the World Bog Snorkelling Championships in August.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the bar is a quarry-tiled pool room, formerly an extension to contain the new kitchen, which still retains its range fireplace and has the pub game of quoits. The part Georgian, part early Victorian three-storey hotel has a lounge bar with a velour padded bar front, bar back shelves and stone fireplace which all look very late 1960s. There is also a residents' lounge, restaurant and 21 bedrooms, as well as its own brewery at the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neuadd Arms Hotel is one of the three venues for the ten day Mid Wales Beer Festival in November over two weekends including the 20th., and the pub holds its own Winter Warmer beer festival on the second weekend in January.",

The two bar counters are of polished Ruabon brickettes laid in a herringbone fashion and they replaced two hatches. There are three fireplaces with differing styles all from c.1954, also using polished Ruabon bricks from the Ruabon 'Red Works' which was founded in 1878. One of the four opened-up rooms has the feel of an earlier period with its good inter-war fixed bench seating.\r\n\r\nLook for the empty beer can which is apparently worth more than \u2018a few bob\u2019!

On the rear right the games room housed a full sized snooker table until a few years ago but still retains some original fixed seating and modern high backed settles.\n\n\nThe nearby Bowling Green has the most surviving etched windows in a Wrexham pub - note the 'Bottle & Jug Entrance' in stone above a blocked-up arch. \n\nA rare survivor is the small thatched historic Horse & Jockey in the redeveloped town centre of Wrexham still retains a traditional layout but a couple of fires in the 70/80s unfortunately destroyed any old fittings.",

        "Description": "The marvellous unspoilt public bar and a snug annexe to the left in this 17/18th century inn are barely altered in 50 years. This was a coaching inn on the London to Holyhead route prior to Telford's Menai Suspension Bridge. In the courtyard is what is recorded in The Guinness Book of Records as the largest simple-hinged door in Britain (11 feet wide and 13 feet high). The oldest pub fittings are the shelving at the rear of the servery in the public bar. As the photo from the 1960s on the wall above the fireplace shows there were large niches to the left and right of the fireplace but in recent years the left one has become an arched short passageway to link a former separate business. This is now a tiny snug bar, which has a brick bar counter of c.1960 with two old wooden hatch doors above and marble bar top.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance hall with a flagstone and tiled floor has an Art Nouveau decoration on a window to the bar/left side. The residents\u2019 lounge on the right was a shop in 1928. The last major changes to the public bar were possibly around 1940, the date on the bank of three handpumps with red Bakelite handles. The brick fireplace, bar counter featuring four rows of 1930s-looking bricks and the red leather bay window seating could well date from c.1940. The stable door/hatch to the side looks much older.",

In the centre is the lounge, which was a shop prior to 1954, and retains its bar fittings from the 1950s. The chunky timber counter was slightly extended on the right in the 1970s and a new bar top was added; the bar back shelves have a Formica covering. The fine carved settles and chairs add to the character of the room and a line drawing on the wall confirms the fireplace is a replacement. The public bar on the left was two rooms prior to 1954 and has some genuine beams, an old stone fireplace at the front and 1950s brick one at the rear. The dado panelling and some seating could well date back to the 1950s, the unusual area above the servery is much older. The public bar counter is a replacement but in the same style as the one in the lounge. The dining room also has an old stone fireplace at the front but recently the 1950s brick one at the rear was replaced. A passage links the three rooms and has a quarry-tiled floor. In common with the town itself, the pub is predominantly Welsh-speaking.",

The Old Vigour has been in the same family for 115 years and it remained little-altered until c.1960. The three existing small rooms were all refurbished and nothing much has changed since so this pub is stuck in a 1960s time warp. The oldest surviving fittings are the bar back shelves, best viewed from the small public bar. Also, note the old 'Commercial Room' wording on the door of the third room. The small smoke room at the front right, which is served from a hatch/doorway to the side of the bar, originally contained the hotel reception. Prior to the opening of the Catholic Church in 1965, church services were held in the lounge.",

The pub was recently bought by Celt Experience Brewery, who have exposed the slate floor in the main bar on the right. It retains an old bar counter but new panels have recently been added to the front, and a new top has replaced the Formica one added in the 1960s. Some bar back shelves may be old as is the wide arch over the counter. This small room has a massive inglenook style fireplace with a high mantelshelf held up by six decorative brackets, a brick interior and a coal fire. Two ceiling supports above the fireplace have their grapes decoration picked out in colour. In the past the main public bar was the only room but a small lounge on the left was added and last modernised in the 1960s. Also in the 1960s the rear former private quarters were converted into what is now the pool room, which has a lino-tiled floor and slate fireplace. Folk music 1st Wed. of the month.",

This small room has some old bar back shelves and in 1965 part of a former decoratively carved dressing table was added in front (other parts of the dresser are above the counter in the passage and in the lounge). The very traditional public bar has a Victorian bar counter with a copper top that replaced a Formica one in 1963; a c.1935 brick fireplace under an inglenook with a log fire, a high-backed settle and another 'antique' settle; however, the terrazzo tiled floor was only laid in 1977. The deeply rutted scrubbed table in the public bar is believed to be 400 years old. The pub was extended to the rear in the late 1960s to create a modern lounge bar (and further extended in the 1970s). This saw the removal of a tiny snug just behind the public bar.  Since the hatch was added in the passageway in the 1960s this has become a popular place for drinkers. The pool room on the left was a private lounge and brought into public use in the 1980s.",

The present bar counter, which dates from the 1960s, has a log frontage and copper top and is set back a few feet from the position of the original bar. Originally there was a short passage and doors to both the right-hand side of the pub and into the left-hand side, which is on a higher level. The removal of the doors make the interior look similar in style to many pubs, however, the amount of change is very little. A small dining room at the rear has been brought into use.\r\n\r\nSituated on a steep wooden hillside, there are splendid views over the Conwy valley from the car park and the pub is popular with bird watchers.

        "Description": "A 200-year-old basic locals\u2019 pub with stables at the rear. It has been in the same family since 1940 and was run by Nellie Hopkins, the longest-serving pub landlady in Wales at 62 years when she died in 2002 aged 92. Originally three rooms, the one on the front right has been used by the family as living room for many years. The public bar on the left still retains its Victorian bar counter but it has a frontage added in c.1980, which is the date the dado panelling was added to the room. The bar back fitting in the public bar includes a till drawer dating from the 1950s, which is the date of the brick fireplace. Note the remains of the glazed screen over the bar counter and the slopes of the door frame. At the rear is the lounge with an old stone fireplace and service via a door to the back of the bar.",

It has a tiny bar on the left with a slatted wood counter at least 30 years old, simple shelves for a bar back, which look older, dado panelled walls with benches attached, and a hatch on the right. An even tinier lounge on the right has some old panelling around the fireplace but the fixed seating is post-war. A famous rugby pub, it has lots of memorabilia on the walls including signed photos by international players such as Ray Gravell. On the side of the three-storey mid-19th-century building it is recorded that a team sponsored by the pub won the World Tournament Rugby Sevens in 1989 held at Amsterdam. Note the trap door in the floor, which is how the beer is dropped into the cellar. Between the two rooms are staircases - down to the toilets and up to private quarters. A number of famous actors including Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, and Richard Burton drank in the pub while filming \u2018Under Milk Wood\u2019 in nearby Laugharne.",

        "Address": "Cresswell Quay, SA68 0TE",
        "Description": "Only the most minor of changes have been made to the unspoilt public bar of this out-of-the way pub. This fine creeper covered 18th-century house beside a tidal creek was remodelled and opened as a pub in the 1880s. Alice Davies ran it from 1961 until 1981 when she was in her 90s and the oldest licensee in the county. Maurice & Janet Cole took over in 1981 and looked after Alice Davies until she died aged 105. The Victorian public bar looks little different to when it was opened in 1880 with red and black quarry-tiled floor, open cast-iron fireplace, Victorian counter and bar back shelves held up by slender columns. Seating includes basic benches attached to a half-height panelled dado. The only change made by the Coles\u2019 has been to cut a narrow opening in the dividing wall to the former kitchen and pantry in c.1981 to expand the public area and slightly extend the bar counter. The rear area also has a red and black quarry-tiled floor - a wood stove has recently replaced the old Aga cooker with tiled surround. Note the door with a number \u20183\u2019 on it, which suggests it was a room used for storing alcohol (the numbering was a requirement of Customs and Excise for rooms for serving or storing alcohol). To the rear right is a further room, which has been brought into public use in recent years. It has an early 20th-century tiled and cast-iron fireplace and glass-fronted display cabinet. Gents\u2019 accessed via passageway - the original outside gents' are still there!\n\r\nRecently handpumps have been installed to replace the the most traditional of way of serving real ale \u2013 from casks on stillage behind the counter into a jug and then from the jug into your glass.",

        "Description": "The Cwmdu Inn and its separate small shop have been run by the villagers since 2000. A visit is highly recommended to see both, particularly the small public bar where you will soon be drawn into conversation accompanied by good beer - the essence of a traditional pub. It is part of an early 19th-century terrace including a small shop/post office and holiday cottages and has been owned by the National Trust since 1991. Both the pub and shop were in the hands of Miss Annie Griffiths for 50 years until she died in 1987 aged 98. Since 2000 it has been run by a volunteer community structure with a unique partnership with the National Trust, as all previous attempts by them to run it in a viable way using their standard way of charging a commercial rent to individuals (five in all) were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nCymdeithas Cwmdu holds monthly meetings to run the pub and shop; also events such as Cwmdu Fete last Sat. in June; Apple Day 1st Sat. (possibly 2nd) in October etc. On 23rd October 2009 HRH Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and President of the National Trust visited Cwmdu including its inn and shop and the locals will keenly show you photos from the event.\r\n\r\nA flagstone corridor runs from the front door of  to the servery at the rear with a figure \u20182\u2019 on the door. On the right is the originally public room, as there was no bar in Annie\u2019s day, and the beer was fetched from the servery. On the left is the public bar with the figure \u20181\u2019 on the door and behind it the original servery. This very small public bar was Annie Griffiths\u2019 living room and as part of the restoration in 1994 the National Trust added a small counter/hatch by cutting a hole in the wall on the servery side. This small room has a flagstone floor, large stone fireplace with a log fire, old settle and a dartboard. It acts as the restaurant room on a Sat. (beyond it is a kitchen), and is used for quiz nights; folk evenings 1st Fri. of month; Classic Club every 2nd Thu. of month; if rugby is on TV; and if the public bar is full. The tiny bar has a flagstone floor, two settles and just a couple of tables.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beer is from Evan Evans brewed in nearby Llandeilo, usually the 4.0% Cwrw (= Welsh for beer) - note the hoist used to lift casks onto the stillage. By the door to the servery two items from Annie\u2019s day - the old bottle opener and the V-shaped item is a jam jar lid opener! There are small rooms upstairs.",

It has a bare wood floor, a 1930s bar counter, old bar back shelves, wood-panelled ceiling, casks of Bass on a stillage, old dado panelled walls and a log fire. On the ceiling are the beer prices for the period 1982 to 1988 - a pint in 1982 was 52p and in 1988 was 92p, an increase of 77% in just 6 years whereas whisky rose from 45p to 62p i.e. only 37%! At the end of the passage is another bare-floored bar with wood-panelled walls of various ages, a more modern bar counter, a new brick fireplace and an old basic bench. The outside gents' and ladies' are now under cover. Up seven steps is the recently created 'sky lounge' with tables and heaters for smokers and anyone else who wants to join them.",

In 1950 a hatch was changed to an arch over a lapped wood counter in the public bar, and bar back shelves added to ply-panelled walls. The brick fireplace dates from c.1950 and one section of the 1950s seating remains. Across the quarry-tiled passage from front door to rear is a lounge/pool room, the front part has more c.1950 hardboard fixed seating and at the rear a 1950s brick fireplace.

The imposing counter and bar-back take up two sides of the front left room and, as well as displaying drinks, are replete with items like water jugs and have tall mirror-fronted cupboards to each side. How very pleasing it is to see how the original bar-back fitting has been carefully preserved - even fridges have been added without destroying one shelf, and there are signs of recent refurbishment to the wood. The original counter curves at the front left-hand side as well as at the centre. \n\nThe original interior of three rooms and a passage was, sadly, opened up by Bass in 1982. There is more elaborate ceiling decoration in the corridor to the rear. At the rear left is a dining room with modern brick bar and at the rear right a conservatory.

It was converted from a stable and expensively fitted out to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 by Gwillym Stefon, licensee who was also a carpenter. It has full height panelling all around the room which came from Llanfarian Village Hall and has shields representing the counties of Wales, their meaning and 'their descriptions in heraldry'. It features a 1950s Tudor Arch shaped brick fireplace - the style seen in Elizabeth I days who with Elizabeth II are featured on the plaque above the fireplace - and an elaborate carved surround which is Jacobean and came from Tan-y-Bwlch mansion. It cost \u00a35 from the builders renovating the mansion and had to be cut down to fit. With very little pub building/refitting just after the Second World War, this in 1953 was one of the first opportunities to tap the optimism of the age - a concious attempt to link it back to the first Elizabethan age.\n\n\nThe quarter circle bar counter with a Formica top and bar back shelves was probably added in the 1960s - prior to that service would be via a hatch (?).

Through a low doorway is the public bar at the rear with another c.1965 bar counter and bar back shelves, which replaced the original small counter on the opposite side of the room. In the hotel part there is an office/reception room, originally a private bar for the well-to-do locals that has a colourful Victorian floor and curved partition walls. To the left of the passage with an 'Old Worthington in Bottle' mirror there is a small dado panelled room to the left, and on the right a room with two tiled fireplaces that until 50 years ago was two small rooms.\r\n\r\nVery busy when the Tregaron Trotting Club (www.tregarontrotting.com) holds its Spring meeting and three days of racing over the August bank holiday called the Festival of Harness; also for Ffair Garon on Spring Bank Holiday Monday.",

The main bar has fittings from that time: a panelled bar counter (but the bar top is modern) and a five-bay mirrored bar back with a third bay. A door (has a figure '5' on it) for staff; on the right are two drawers with cupboards below them. The main bar has a dado of old panelling and a wood surround fireplace. On the mantelpiece is a photo, taken in the 1940s, in the bar. \r\n\r\nThere is a further mirrored bar back to the left of two bays with a row of drawers. It straddles an arch in the servery area between the main bar and a smaller bar to the left. The left hand bar has another panelled bar counter with a black Formica top. The fireplace was opened out in the 1990s and has a large plain mirror above, some old dado panelling but 1960s (?) fixed seating. Double doors lead to a dining room at the rear left constructed in the 1990s. \r\n\r\nA further small room on the right has more dado panelling. and a metal surround fireplace. A gap  leads to the far right pool room, again constructed in the 1990s, with modern dado.",

A pub since 1870 which did have a butchers shop and slaughter house attached. Flagstone passage leads to the tiny servery on the right which is actually on a much lower shallow 'cellar' level and has old bar fittings and service through a hatch with a window now permanently open and a Formica shelf. The layout was two separate rooms until 1960 when a wall was removed and replaced by a wooden folding partition which is permanently folded back. At the front there is a flagstone floor, superb curved high backed settle, a 1920's bentwood 'holey' seat and an old fireplace with infill from the early 1980's.  \r\n\r\nIn the rear section the room has half ply panelled walls and a 1980's fireplace with an old mirror surround above. There are an assortment of chairs around the rear of the room and in the middle is an old table skittle which is always ready to play. The local pub games of quoits is also played here. Outside gents' toilets. The villagers support a number of events / evenings the largest of which is a whole day charity event in the summer that in 2013 raised \u00a37,000 and when real ale is on sale.

        "Description": "This remarkable pub is included here for having a tap room where you can sit with casks of beer stillaged alongside you making the Coopers Tavern one of the most precious surviving pubs in the whole of the UK. \r\n\r\nIt is famous for being the former Bass brewery tap. It began life as an overflow store for special malts for the brewery and by 1826 was the repository for Bass's Imperial Stout, after which senior members of the brewery began using it as their private pub. Licensing as a public house followed in 1858 but the back area remained the fiefdom of the select few until about 1950, the hoi polloi being served at a hatch between this 'cellar' and the passage beyond. Now anyone can drink there or in another four small rooms \u2013 two having been added in a sympathetic refurbishment in 2017 when a bar counter was added for the first time in one of the new rooms. \r\n\r\nAccess is via a Staffordshire blue brick passage between Cross Street and Milton Street, which has outside gents' and ladies accessed off it. The tap room has changed little in many years with a tiled floor (modern replacement). Prior to the mid 20th century the current bar/servery was an inner private bar and all but the chosen few were served from a (now removed) hatch door between the cellar and the passageway. It has a door with the figure '4' on it indicating there were three other rooms in use in the past. The brick thralls, that hold a row of casks, were replaced sometime mid 20th century with the similar arrangements now seen. In recent years it has been topped off by stainless steel. You can stand just inside the tap room to order your drinks including a large range of real ales served straight from the cask on a concrete thrall in one wing of the L shaped bar. There is a tiny shelf constructed from coopered staves to place the drinks as they are served and is a recent addition (possibly late 1990s). \r\n\r\nIf not already occupied, you can sit perched up two steps in the rear left hand corner on bare L-shaped old wall bench seating with the back / panelling recently painted dark brown in a very tiny area with terrazzo tiled floor. You can also sit on three benches around five wooden casks used as tables. One of the benches sits in front of a large exterior door (no longer in use). Within the same space is a large variety of beer casks with cooling jackets and other drinks are stored, creating a drinking environment like no other; there are also a number of handpumps The gas heater hanging from the ceiling still works but is no longer used.  \r\n\r\nShelving above the casks is of various ages - the shelving above the stillage was added in 2002/3 - and recently painted dark brown as is an old glass fronted small display cabinet. There are some old bar back shelving near the small shelf for your drinks. Old Bass etc. mirrors have recently been moved so on the walls now are a large modern \u2018Joules Brewery of Market Drayton\u2019 mirror. \r\n\r\nOn the Cross Street end of the building the original second room has two types of quarry-tiles and two fireplaces implying it was two small rooms at one time, but may only one since it became a pub room. At the front is an old wood surround fireplace with a later cast-iron interior and coal fire.

The bar fittings are what would have been seen in thousands of pubs in the 60s - a bar counter with a Formica top (the hardboard counter front has recently been covered by wooden cladding); also a bar back of shelving, some with Formica tops and some of glass. A fireplace at the front was lost many years ago and is now covered by old dado panelling painted a deep red colour - another fireplace with a log burner is not old. This room has recently been knocked through at the far end to create extra space in formerly domestic quarters. The door on the left of the lobby leads into the smaller lounge bar where the two sets of fixed seating here look very 1960s. The bar counter dates from c.1960 with its Formica top (the hardboard counter front has recently been covered by wooden cladding).

        "Description": "A 1937 neo-Georgian style pub built by Linford's of Cannock for Mitchells & Butlers. It has a symmetrical front with entrances in each corner and two carved birds of prey on the front (the Eagle was the symbol of Butlers of Wolverhampton who took over the Cannock Brewery in 1925 so was the pub built by them?). After a period of closure it was bought from Enterprise Inns by Black Country Ales who reopened it in May 2012, following sensitive refurbishment of what was already a largely complete interior\u00a0(it subsequently changed hands in 2019).\u00a0Most doors in the interior appear original. The front right-hand door leads into a lobby with a red and black quarry tiled floor that continues into the gents' and ladies' toilets (currently out of use).\n\r\nLeft of the lobby in the front-centre of the pub, the public bar (listing description says this was formerly gentlemen-only) and also has a red and black quarry-tiled floor, now mostly under carpet. The splendid bar back has been stripped back to its original look and a previously lost Art-Deco pediment replicated and reinstated; on the right-hand side is a dumb waiter (not presently operational). The horizontally panelled bar counter is original, and has brass skirtings and heating pipes along the base. Also original are the brick fireplace and fixed seating, which is in two bays with curved, reupholstered benches. There is a small piece of dado panelling on the right-hand wall, which matches the counter front. The counter top looks recent, as do those in the other rooms.\n\r\nSome years ago, an unsightly arch was cut through to the snug to the left of the bar, but the recent restoration saw this replaced with a rectangular opening - but no door. The snug itself has fixed seating and more horizontal dado panelling. The original fireplace has been brought back into usable condition by Black Country Inns. There is a small square hatch with bar counter and panelled counter front.\n\r\nA sizeable lobby lies behind the front left-hand door; this has more dado panelling and has the same floor tiling as on the right-hand side, also extended into the toilets. At the rear left, with a figure 4 on the door, is a small lounge with a corner counter - the same panelling on the counter front, fixed seating all round the room and a long brick fireplace in an alcove. There is a bell-push in the dado panelling near the door and two others above the seating in the alcove. The unusual tables in this room appear to be contemporary with the building of the pub, and may well be the original ones. The bar-back shelves are a restoration by Black Country Inns, and the canopy over the counter is recent.\n\r\nA door leads to the rear function room which has three arched floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the garden (the middle one has patio doors). A large rectangular hatch to the back of the servery may well have been cut through in recent times. There are two benches here, one relocated from the gents-only bar; the other a new section to match. But there is little else of interest in this quite plain room. The original off-sales was situated to the right of the public bar servery and accessed from a door down the right side of the pub and is now in use as a kitchen.",

The serveries are modern. A passage curves round the servery up steps to the modernised rooms.",

At the front of the pub is a small public bar with bench seating but no original fittings. The two rooms to the right of the passage only came into pub use in 2001, the one at the rear having some 17th-century panelling.\r\n\r\nThe statutory listing description says 'Inn.

The sliding door is in a different position to the original door, which was slightly nearer the entrance and alongside the baffle. The etched \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 window is the only original item left in this second room with its disused door as the small bar was taken out in the early 1990s. The quarry tiled passage has a hatch for service to the large room on the right is also quarry-tiled and has a Victorian tiled fireplace, original half-height panelling and reupholstered benches attached.

A long public bar runs along the front of this back-street local: until the 1950s it would have been two rooms, hence the fireplaces at each end. In the public bar Everards did remove the 1950s bar counter and bar back and replaced them but the fixed seating was just cleaned up and re-polished, the two 1950s brick fireplaces were shot-blasted and now look immaculate and some new tiles were added in the left hand area.\r\n\r\nA central corridor leads to the back of the pub where there is a 'smoke room', actually a small lounge. The lounge has retained its 1950s sturdy bar counter and bar back fitting, the 1950s bench seating and baffles; also the 1950s style brick fireplace was just shot-blasted. The toilets have been modernized with the only remaining old fitting a c.1970 Ansells mirror in the gents\u2019. It does  therefore mean that although there is nothing architecturally memorable or that historic about the fittings, this interior has a no-nonsense simplicity which is, sadly, becoming increasingly rare.",

        "Description": "A fine timber-framed house from the mid/late fifteenth century and certainly in pub use for a couple of centuries. It was restored in 1936 by Wolverhampton brewers W Butler & Co, under the architect James A Swan of Birmingham. He was careful to keep all the sound old woodwork and his care was such that it's hard to distinguish the new work from the old in many cases. He also kept the ornamented seventeenth-century plaster ceiling (front left) and the Tudor/Jacobean carved woodwork over the left-hand fireplaces. Swan placed his public bar at the front (right) with a smoking room (front left) and a 'parlour' behind. There has since been a great deal of reordering (possibly in the 1960s) and the partitions between the two latter rooms and the corridor have been removed and the servery (from 1936 adjacent to the corridor) moved to the rear of the public bar. Much of Swan's panelling and seating survive.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar has a 1930s brick and Tudor shaped stone fireplace and fielded panelling above. Note the plasterwork rose symbols on the ceiling. As well as the impressive four-sectioned ceiling in the front left room, there is 1930s fielded panelling on the walls, a brick and Tudor shaped stone fireplace and 1930s fixed seating. Both left hand rooms have wide openings on to the passage where there is a modern bar counter. In the rear right formerly a living room is a 1930s brick fireplace and a wood block floor. The gents (formerly outside but now linked) retains 4 big 1930s urinals.  \r\n\r\nA page on the website 'Wolverhampton's Listed Buildings\" has details of The 1936 Restoration.",

It has been substantially altered over the years but there are two areas of interest for Art Deco enthusiasts. The right-hand room - formerly two - has several Art Deco features including a concertina-style wooden bar front; original dado panelling with built-in ventilation; a massive original timber fireplace surround enclosing a modern fireplace with big mirrors above; and a fragment of the original bar-back, but no lower shelves. The toilets off this lounge have terrazzo floors and 1930s wall tiles; the Gents' have four original Twyford's urinals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe left-hand side has been taken over by a restaurant (currently closed) but on the first floor, up a sweeping broad staircase with terrazzo top rail, is a function room with contemporary fixed seating to the bar area, shelving for storing customers' packages, coats etc, and impressive circular recesses in the ceiling for light fittings. This room is not normally open for use.",

To the left of the entrance is a splendidly basic public bar with leatherette bench seating and a tiled floor. The recent bar counter is not a thing of beauty. At the right of the entrance is the equally basic lounge. No fixtures and fittings of any interest here and the fireplace has been taken out.

Off the corridor are three completely separate snugs: a very small one rear-left (behind the servery but with no link to it); and a slightly larger one rear-right, both of these with original benches. The front-right snug has no benches, a modern panelled dado and pool table. All three snugs have had fireplaces replaced by radiators.",

The entrance on Banbury Street opens into what was a tiled corridor and enlarged drinking area (which would have had a hatch to the servery). This has now been opened to the L-shaped public bar which retains its counter. In common with other pubs of this vintage and in this area, there is a refitted smoke room at the rear.

A fine example of a large interwar suburban pub, as at 2004 still basically a drinkers' local, and un-themed with little evidence of food. Excellent prominent building in pale stone with Cotswold-Tudor features. Good original doors and four fine porch canopies, carved with oak leaves, acorns and drinking and brewing scenes. Inside, two large rooms with separate entrances. On the left, a fine large public bar, substantially unaltered; probably originally two rooms: front bar area with TV, and rear room with pool and darts; the servery has a good original counter and fine bar-back with carved wood, leaded glass and a clock in 'astrological' style; also good benches all round and panelled walls. \r\nOn the right, the lounge has been much modernised, and combined with a rear raised function room; few original features: some panelling, a big original stone Tudor-style fireplace, and a very large M&B mirror with the pub name and deer-leaping illustration. Unfortunately the former bowling green at the side is now abandoned, and the stone pavilions and shelters around it have been demolished. Five stone pillars around the car park have \u2018M&B\u2019 lettering carved into the sandstone on each side - 20 instances in all; however, these are badly weather-eroded.  \r\n\r\nUpdate July 2006: Converted to a buffet-restaurant 'MODERN CHINA' - the interior is totally gutted and replaced by a single large room in modern d\u00e9cor.",

        "Description": "A two-bay, white-painted 18th century brick building adjacent to the old parish church of Harborne and really a country pub in what is now a Birmingham suburb. Exactly how old the building is is hard to say but it was probably a timber-framed building originally which has been altered many times over the years. The building is said to have been opened as a pub between 1860 and 1864 by a plumber and glazier, George Reece. The spine is a central corridor with a red-tiled floor and timber dado. Half way up on the left is a remarkably small counter to the servery which has been formed at the bottom of the stairs. At the front is what used to be a public drinking area which could only be accessed through the servery - but this is now a staff area.\r\n\r\n\r\nRear-left is a snug with fixed seating, more red-tiled flooring, a glazed hatch to the servery and a vast fireplace. The big room is on the right, running from front to back. When it took its present form with its fixed seating and abundance of mock half-timbering is uncertain but it was probably in the interwar period. The solidity of the half-timbering is in marked contrast to the much flimsier work in the corridor which is probably from the early post-war period. At the rear is a well-tended and very unusual L-shaped bowling green.",

A triangular tiled porch leads to a small bar on the front left with the original counter incorporating a row of Minton tiles and the original bar back which also serves the tap room on the right. The lounge on the front right is an amalgamation of the outdoor and the lounge - on the bar counter you can see where the partition was situated. This room has the original counter but some tiles were damaged and rest re-used on the rear smoke room counter hence the different tiles on the tap room counter. Original entrance to front right room was on wall near old off-sales door, now blocked-up so the fixed seating in the front of the old door is modern; the bay window and that left of the 1920s tiled and wood surround fireplace is original.\n\r\nIn the rear smoke room the bar counter is larger than originally - the left hand piece is in its original position but the two right hand sections are re-positioning / replacements; the Mintons tiles being transferred from the tap room counter. The bar back fitting in the smoke room is actually the original exterior windows of this room - they were removed to create the doorway to the rear dining room in 1990. On the right is a 1920s tiled and wood surround fireplace and interwar fixed seating. The dining room on the rear right has no old fittings.\"",

The layout is unaltered, but only the front bar is regularly open to the public.

The good chunky curved bar counter, old benches around the walls, and a couple of wooden screens next to the doors are probably all Victorian. The L-shaped bar-back is probably 1930s and features a corner cupboard with leaded glass incorporating the Atkinson's trade mark of three \"A's\" in a circle. At the rear is a corridor with a hatch and doorway to the servery; across the corridor is a smoke room currently used for storage; and rear of the servery is a small former snug-lounge with a hatch-door for service - this room looks to be in private use.

        "Pub Name": "Hare & Hounds",
        "Address": "106 High Street, Birmingham, Kings Heath, B14 7JZ",
        "Description": "A large, corner-site pub-cum-hotel rebuilt in 1906-7. Architect: Samuel Owen of Owen & Ward for Holt Brewery Company. (Birmingham Pubs states \u201cIn 1906 Charles H Collett bought the original Hare & Hounds from Mrs Eleanor Collins and others; he then mortgaged it back to Mrs Collins and to the Holt Brewery Company; rebuilt the pub and sold it to Holts in 1910. Holt seemed to have been the real clients all along,\u2026\u201d) Large three-storey building of red brick with red terracotta dressings. The central rendered gable on High Street side has timber-framing with the words 'Hare and Hounds' and the date \u20181907\u2019. On the corner is an octagonal turret with clock faces capped by a lead dome. On York Road elevation there is a half timbered oriel window on the first floor. \r\n\r\nThis pub is well worth a visit to view a remarkably impressive display of floor to ceiling Art Nouveau-style tiling by Maws, especially in the hallway and stairs accessed from the York Road entrance. The dado tiling is particularly impressive being an example of Maw & Co\u2019s tube-lining technique in which areas of colour are separated by thin ribbons of clay laid on the tile, rather like toothpaste. The dado has floral motifs in deep green, pastel blue, mustard and brown; and above the dado more tiles of creamy green broken by strips of crisp flower forms. The tiling continues up the stairwell and along the corridor on the first floor in the form of a colourful dado as previously described and creamy green tiles above. \r\n\r\n\u2018Birmingham Pubs 1880-1939\u2019, published in 1986, listed 5 pubs open at the time with Maws tiling: \u2013 the Britannia, Aston, which is currently closed after a period as a caf\u00e9; the Church Tavern, Aston which has been demolished; the New Inns, Handsworth, which is now flats; the Kings Head, Hagley Road, Harborne (built 1905 to a design similar to the Hare & Hounds) where only a small amount of tiling survives in the staircase area and on the first floor landing in an otherwise modernised pub; leaving the Hare & Hounds the only pub remaining in Birmingham with a large display of Maw & Co tiling. Other rare displays of Maw & Co tiling can be found at the Seven Stars, Oldswinford, Stourbridge and Bulls Head, Wrockwardine Wood, Telford. At the rear of the hall with its terrazzo floor is an open staircase with a fine newel post. An illustration in \u2018Birmingham Pubs 1880-1939\u2019 shows it originally had a metallic Holt squirrel squatting on the newel post holding a branch from which two lamps hung. \r\n\r\nOriginally there were a number of handsome partitions which created separate bars along the High Street side and they remained more or less unchanged until around 1983. The public bar is now one L-shaped room \u2013 two former entrance doors have been bricked up \u2013 firstly one on York Road side led into a small vestibule, some of which remains \u2013 look up and you can see the outline on the ceiling. In this area there is a notable clock with Holt squirrel, by Marsh & Co, Birmingham featuring Queen Victoria's crest, \"Rebuilt 1907\"; with surrounding metalwork suspended from the ceiling. Another door was situated just inside the York Road entrance passageway and was blocked-up in 1983 \u2013 inside the public bar you can see a wood surround and mirror but tiles either side of it. \r\n\r\nThe entrance on High Street side leads into a vestibule with a \u2018Bar\u2019 etched panel in the top of the left hand inner door. The walls of the public bar have a fielded panelling dado then above are tiles in shades of green and cream and at the top a frieze of more tiling including leaf and face motifs. The right hand side wall has no tiling as this is new stud wall added in 1983 to create a kitchen, which means a short piece of bar counter may be missing from the right hand end? \r\n\r\nThe current entrance to the left hand side of the public bar is a doorway (double) door(s) removed) on the far left in a curved mahogany screen with coloured leaded glass and some sliding panels, which is clearly original and in situ as confirmed by the line of the terrazzo floor in the hallway. If you take a look at the public bar side there is a small shelf at bar-height and small panelled sash windows. \r\n\r\nThe panelled mahogany bar counter is the original with pilasters but is shorter. Look above the bar counter and on the right hand / High Street side a drop in the ceiling height matches the line of the woodwork over the bar counter but on the left hand side the bar counter is set some two feet back from the ceiling height drop and a cornice. In 1983 the bar counter was pushed back some two feet and also was truncated on the left hand side. Originally the servery was much larger and incorporated the two mahogany pillars with mirror panels and curved on the left side to meet the curved screen and the present entrance was originally one for staff. \r\n\r\nThe elaborate carved mahogany bar-back remains having two bays on the left side (originally there were more) and five bays on the right including the middle one which faces two ways. They include advertising mirrors for Holts Brewery and various drinks in the top part and ornate narrow mirror panels just above the main shelf height. Birmingham Pubs stated that the bar back had a Holt squirrel perched in front of it but there is no sign of this now. The pot shelf was probably added in 1983 but has good quality stained and leaded panels to make it look authentic. The public bar has what looks like a Lincrusta ceiling but in the hallway (particularly the lower ceiling height) some of the ceiling is covered in a plastic moulded replica. Original fixed seating is lost in the public bar. \r\n\r\nThe rear lounge was formerly two small smoke rooms and it retains its original fixed seating in two areas and also a wonderful tiled, copper interior and wood surround fireplace with a polished copper boss depicting a hare and hound and fine mantelpiece but is disused. The bar back fitting is the original with four bays, the second being a doorway for staff and the lower shelves have, unusually, arched bays. The bar counter looks old but is of a slightly different design and lesser quality than the public bar counter so could be a post war replacement? There is more fielded dado panelling but another fireplace has been lost. \r\n\r\nA wide gap has been cut into the front wall of the smoke room and a partition with a doorway gap inserted, presumably from the public bar? The small area beyond is likely to be the original off sales as the listed description states \u201cThe High Street elevation has entrances to former outdoor department and to bar.\u201d The right hand High Street side entrance is now disused but the internal porch retains its attractive floor to ceiling tiling. The door with the \u2018Out-Door\u2019 etched glass panel has been re-located to the Smoke Room door from the hallway. There is a doorway at the rear leading to an ante room with tiling on the wall now painted over and a door with \u2018Gentlemen\u2019 etched and frosted panel which now leads to a store room. The Smoke Room is only open Wed, Fri, Sat and Sun evenings but staff will show you this room and the upstairs rooms if you call at a quiet time, but maybe best to ring ahead to check. \r\n\r\nThe first floor corridor leads to a large detached function room on the York Road side over a former carriage entrance. Now called \u2018Venue 1\u2019, it has a barrel vault ceiling with embossed plaster ribs, plaster frieze, pilasters and garlands but most of the superb Baroque detailing is hidden by black painted surfaces throughout. \r\n\r\nOn the first floor corner of the building is the former Billiard Room still with a good proportion of its raised original fixed seating which runs around the curved corner bay window, etched exterior windows and an original tiled, wood surround fireplace with mantelpiece including columns and capitals and a polished copper boss depicting a hare and hound but is not in use. A stage has been added and this room is now called \u2018Venue 2\u2019. The Hare & Hounds is now one of Birmingham\u2019s prime live music venues \u2013it hosted UB40\u2019s first ever gig in 1979 \u2013 a fact that is recorded on a plaque on the exterior.",

A small locals' pub dating back to 1841.A plan of 1913 shows a layout comprising a left hand side bar to the front servery, a centre room to the rear (which was a private parlour converted to a snug) and a right hand side tap room - this last was subsequently knocked through to incorporate a private living room behind. Nowadays, a central entrance between two re-glazed bay windows leads into a central corridor with the best rooms on the left, either side of the servery. The most impressive item is the bar-back with its gold glazed panel at the top and black 'WINES & SPIRITS' lettering. The room has  benches, but a modern counter and pot shelf, and a modern Banks's fireplace. Back of the servery the small plain snug has service via a doorway - plushly-upholstered benches all round but no other features. The right-hand rooms have been opened-out with the corridor; there are some benches but no other old features.",

        "Address": "1 Saint Mary's Row, Birmingham, Moseley, B13 8HW",
        "Description": "Built as the Fighting Cocks by Newton & Cheatle for Holt's Brewery in 1898-1899. It is a fabulous building inside and out despite suffering from various corporate refurbishments, including a Firkin branding in the 1990s, and a Goose branding later. It has a superb brick and stone exterior in Tudor / Arts and Crafts / Mackintosh style with a clock tower; big colourful Birmingham stained and leaded glass windows and a barometer and wind-speed indicator next to the corner entrance. The original layout of three rooms surrounding a central servery can still be discerned. There is a public bar on the front and left originally separated by a modest partition and now amalgamated with the off sales on the front right; smoke room on rear right accessed through a hall; and a smoke room behind the servery accessed from a hall on the rear left.  \r\n\r\nOn the front left there is an original timber entrance vestibule with etched and frosted panels at the top; fielded panelling on the dado and above Victorian tiles right up to the ceiling. The two doors have good etched and frosted panels. The original L-shaped panelled counter remains and a fine heavy mahogany gantry in Arts and Crafts style facing two sides. It is of three bays each side with tiled panels throughout, etched mirrors and a good plain counter. The walls have a dado of fielded panelling with Victorian green wall tiles by Craven Dunnill reaching to the ceiling and a decorative copper ceiling now painted black.  \r\n\r\nOn the front right is another good lobby with tiling from floor to ceiling. In the former lounge on the right hand wall are two tiled panels which were thought to have be lost in 1980s alterations but came to light again during 1991 restoration work. They were made by Craven Dunnill. One shows a pub labelled as the Fighting Cocks, so shows what the predecessor of the present one looked like. The other shows a church with a spire in a rural setting: it certainly isn\u2019t the local medieval building since this has no spire and the setting is quite wrong. Between the tiled paintings is a tiled, cast-iron and wood surround fireplace which may be original, original dado panelling but the bar counter here is modern. There is small modernised room to the rear.",

There is a good wood surround fireplace with columns and capitals, tiles with floral decoration and cast-iron interior (date?). There are good typical Birmingham colourful leaded exterior windows and a fine ceiling rose. The rear left room called the cocktail lounge has another good ceiling rose but all the fittings date from c.2010 - bar counter, bar back, wood and cast-iron fireplace and dado panelling (the servery is only in use on Fri and Sat.) At the end of the passageway are good original window panels and a door to the back garden with a large covered area.",

It has an excellent exterior with a narrow frontage to main road but a longer side frontage. The front elevation has wonderful central arched doorway of stone, brick and tiles. Above is a large stone-carved antelope insignia by William Bloye, plus the pub name and 'MITCHELLS & BUTLERS' in relief, and good drainpipes. The side elevation has a sundial (\"I tell the bright hours only\"), a smaller antelope sign, a licensing sign carved in stone, and several arched doorways and dormers. The front square-shaped bar is plain and open in character, and has had alterations, but retains features from the original design. There is a brick-tiled floor, and benches in the front part. The wall-panelling and timber lobby around the front door feature a carved band around the top. The bar-counter is original with similar carved pieces, but has had an ugly false ceiling, bar mountings and a new bar-back added. There is an original brick and stone fireplace. In the centre of the room is a splendid column with carved timber faces and a splayed timber capital. The room is spoilt by the unnecessary additions to the servery, and modern paraphernalia such as gaming machines, TV projector, ventilation box, etc. At the rear is a lounge, also panelled, but modernised and less interesting. \r\n\r\nUpdate 2012. Now Hajee's Spices Restaurant and historic pub interior has been completely removed so deleted.",

The first one called the Killarney Room has a decorative carved panelled fireplace and the far one called the \"G.O.\" as it was a gents only room in the past, and has wood panelled walls and a bar counter added in the 50/60s. The large bar at the front has original panelled walls, but the bar counter, bar-back and fixed seating have been replaced. An extension on the left added in the 1960s includes a modernised lounge / function room and a former off-sales shop which is now an insurance office. A door in Thornhill Road shows where the original off-sales was.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 2014: The two rear rooms are no longer in use and staff will not give you access so therefore its 'Regionally Important Historic Interior' status has been removed until the situation changes.",

The exterior is in brick and stone with a timbered and gabled upper floor, wonderful original leaded and painted windows all round, and original doors: only the corner entrance is now in use. Also has an original hanging sign, and lanterns above two doors. The heavily-leaded windows have an important influence on the interior character and are ornamented with heraldic glass and, of course, the eponymous mitre. The interior has suffered from poor-quality alterations over the years, but retains some original features of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflecting the shape of the site, the servery (in the centre) is triangular but the rooms surrounding it are now interlinked and it is not easy to work out exactly how the arrangements were. Apart from the public bar at the front they would have been quite small (such as the lounge on the Crown Lane side). Note the dumb waiter in the servery; carved bar counter; leaded and glazed screen behind the bar with painted 'mitre' panel; panelling in the front pool room and rear lounge; Tudor-style walls with pegged timber frames; ceiling cornices with 'vine' decoration in the lounge. Also four fireplaces - two in stone with carved timber chimney-piece incorporating clocks; one with timber-framed upper part; and a brick one in the rear lobby.",

Of red brick, it is situated close to Stourbridge Junction station. It has an outstanding collection of M&B etched and painted windows and there is lots of Maw & Co wall tiling. The original layout survives with some alterations. The main entrance is into a hall with a restaurant on the left and public bar and rear smoke room to the right. The hallway has large amounts of light blue and cream dado tiling and this extends up the stairs and into the public bar. A hatch in the hallway shows that the servery has been slightly truncated. The public has its original bar counter and a magnificent, ornately-carved four-bay bar-back with mirrors and a central pediment with (replica) clock. Beneath the pediment, the hatch to the smoke room was recently reopened and has a lovely piece of M&B coloured glass above. The right-hand external door once accessed an off-sales but this was incorporated into the bar many years ago. The former smoke room rear-right has been modernised, but unused bell-pushes survive above the benches as do the etched windows proclaiming 'Smoking Room'. The restaurant area occupies the former lounge bar but has been refurbished in caf\u00e9 bar style and greatly extended at the left hand side; a couple of etched windows are the only items of interest. \r\n\r\nHistoric details courtesy of Pevsner Architectural Guides: Birmingham and the Black Country', by Andy Foster, Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandraa Wedgwood.

        "Description": "An imposing and ornate red-brick building of 1898 by Wood & Kendrick (Wednesbury Herald, 27 Aug. 1898) who did many a pub in the West Midlands conurbation. This pub is notable for the marvellous front bar with its spectacular ceramic counter with fabulous embossed tiles in pink, green, ochre, brown and cream. It has gargoyle-looking figures with their tongues out on pilasters all along it. The left-hand part (about one-sixth) of the counter was cut off in post-war times and replaced by a wooden counter on a diagonal which meets the back wall. Originally the counter continued in a straight line to meet the left hand wall (i.e. it didn't curve round on the left-hand side as it does on the right-hand side). This is one of the most impressive ceramic bar counters in the country in terms of its detail, colour, and size. \r\n\r\nCAMRA is only aware of 14 remaining examples of ceramic bar counters in the whole of the UK (11 in England).  Other Heritage Pubs with a ceramic bar counter are the Black Horse, Preston, Lancashire; Burlingtons Bar (at the Town House), St Annes on Sea, Lancashire; Mountain Daisy, Sunderland, Tyne & Wear; Red Lion, Erdington, Birmingham; Polar Bear, Hull, East Yorkshire; White Hart Hotel, Hull, East Yorkshire; Garden Gate, Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire; Golden Cross, Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales; and Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nOther examples can be found at Castle, Manchester City Centre; Whitelock\u2019s Ale House, Leeds, West Yorkshire;  Waterloo Hotel & Bistro, Newport, Gwent, Wales which has no public bar facility; and there is one in China Red which was the Coach & Horses, Dunswell, East Yorks and now operates as a Chinese Restaurant. There was one in the  Hark to Towler, Tottington, Greater Manchester where the bar has been moved; but the pub closed and has been converted into four flats so we must assume the bar counter has been lost. \r\n\r\nThere is also a very good large, six-bay original arcaded timber bar-back with lots of mirrored sections including some part gilded ones and an off-centre clock. The arcading on the bar-back also meets the left wall but only the top sections of the left hand two bays remain so part including the lower shelving has been lost and a new doorway cut so staff could reach the new lounge servery. Originally there was a hatch to the lobby (where the new entrance to the public bar is situated \u2013 originally it was right by the front door), which was used for service to the rear Smoking Room. \r\n\r\nOn the right-hand side two bays of lower shelving remain with two replaced by fridges. Originally the public bar was split into two by a partition with a doorway in the middle and there was a vestibule entrance in the centre but all these were removed in post-war times \u2013 the present screens were added in 1998. A number of original etched windows remain but most of the fixed seating is modern. \r\n\r\nThe side entrance on Hobbs Road has two inner doors with the figures \u20184\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 on them \u2013 behind the left-hand one is the off sales and service was via the two-part rising hatch in the bar back fitting which still remains. The hall behind the servery has a colourful Victorian tiled floor and a tall fridge is situated in front of the off sales hatch. The Lounge/Dining Room at the rear was created in post-war times by doubling the size of the former Smoking Room and removing the original toilets etc. and a servery was added for the first time. New toilets were added to the front left of the pub as well as a new staircase to the upstairs function room, which has a modern servery. The access to the function room was originally via a staircase from the hall at the rear right - a doorway in the back of the servery (with hatch for service?) has been permanently closed. \r\n\r\nThe pub was built with a bowling green but this has been replaced by the car park. On the outbuildings you can see the wording  \u2018Bowling Green\u2019 painted on brick.",

        "Description": "A small Victorian pub with a relatively unaltered layout and the most recent alterations probably dating from the 1970s. It has a double bay-windowed frontage and a central entrance leading into a corridor with red and black tiled floor. On the right is a good small plain front bar with the servery; there are benches in the bay, an old counter with mosaic glass front but modern top; and plain old bar shelves with delicate spindle supports and mosaic glass; the fireplace has gone. Hatch service to the corridor, then on the other side is a room extending from front to back; this was formerly two separate snugs, but now combined with the front door blocked up; the two fireplaces have gone, but there are benches all round. Rear-right behind the servery is a small snug with modern counter - converted from a living room in the 1970s. The d\u00e9cor is 'beamed' M&B style from the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nListed Desc. says:\"The pub is known locally as \"Spittle's\" because of its former landlord Jonah Spittle (1765 - 1844) who organised cock fights on adjacent land and was one of the subjects of the well-known broadside ballad \"Wedgebury Cocking\".\"",

        "Description": "Built in 1860, a small brick terraced pub with a yard in front. Alterations in 1925 by architect W A Hutchins removed the rear snug on the left hand side and rooms behind to create the current bar servery, private room behind and ladies toilet. A central corridor runs through the pub, with hatch service. The main bar is on the left, with post-war 'beam and plaster' alterations in the past and crude work around the servery. The best rooms are two snugs over the corridor on the right: (1) the front one is in lounge style, with a simple fireplace and benches around two walls; other benches may have been removed and replaced by a dado; (2) the rear snug is plainer, with a red-tiled floor and a brick fireplace; the benches are simple with a painted timber dado behind. Both snugs have TV, jukebox unit and games console, the clutter of which spoils the rooms somewhat. In the corner of the rear yard is the legendary Gents' toilet, which has a bank of three old urinals and a substantial tree inside!",

        "Pub Name": "Posada",
        "Address": "48 Lichfield Street, Wolverhampton, WV1 1DG",
        "Description": "An elegant town-centre pub, built in 1886 on the site of its predecessor, the Noah's Ark; the notable faience frontage dates from a remodelling of 1900 by local architect Fred T. Beck. On the wall of the smoke room are the plans showing the changes made in 1983 (Architects: David Horne Associates) when Allied Breweries converted the pub into one of the earliest of their \u2018Holt, Plant & Deakin\u2019 pubs \u2013 these did include making an archway through the rear wall to give access to the smoke room and creating a third room at the rear. \r\n\r\nIt has an excellent ceramic exterior including the wording 'The Posada' on three tiled panels \u2013 one on the fascia and two in vertical lettering on pilasters in each of the external recessed porches which have mosaic floors. Below the small-paned bowed window is a dado of golden yellow glazed brick and tiles. Both porches have a glazed brick and tiled dado in golden yellow with cream glazed brick above up to ceiling height with a dark yellow tiled frieze at the top and mosaic floors. Of the five main lower front windows the central three are now plain, which is not likely to have been the case when the pub was built. The leaded window in the right hand door is a modern replacement. \r\n\r\nThe public bar is a very special room with its tiled walls in orange-brown on the dado and cream above, original bar fittings including rare snob screens and is little altered since 1900. The left hand door leads into a vestibule that looks modern as does the panelling so it has been added later, possibly in 1983. The bar counter looks like the original 1900 one with panelled frontage \u2013 the only changes being a 1960s/70s slanting piece of timber piece on the left for the present hatch; also, there is a cut right at the front right-hand end where the quadrant becomes straight, facing to the window which is where the hatch was originally. \r\n\r\nThe original ornate bar back fitting has mirrored panels on the lower part above the main shelf and above that a row of snob screens with plain bevelled glass in them. Original sets of snob screens are rare with examples at the Bartons Arms, Aston, Birmingham; Prince Alfred, London W9;   Bunch of Grapes, London SW3;  Lamb, London WC1;  Travellers Friend, Woodford Green, Greater London;  Crown, London N1;  Gate, London N22; also Holly Bush, London NW3;  and  Crown & Greyhound, London SE21  but in the case of the last two they have been moved. Recent losses include those at the King Edward VII, Aston, Birmingham. Above the snob screens is a row of four Art Nouveaux leaded and green stained panels. Two-thirds of the lower back fitting shelving has been lost to fridges. \r\n\r\nThe public bar has a glazed brick and tiled dado in golden yellow with some in relief with cream coloured glazed brick-shape tiles above from floor up to ceiling height. The tiling is complete on the left hand wall, on the right hand wall i.e. in the passageway, with a tiled dado on the front / exterior wall under the windows with a narrow band of tiles above the windows. On the rear wall the original tiled dado extends to just before the 1980s cut-through with a good sized section at the top all the way from the left to right wall so some tiling is missing. There is a row of golden yellow tiles in relief one row just below the ceiling on the walls. On the left hand wall there is some notable staining on the cream tiles - apparently wallpaper was placed over them as part of the 1983 conversion into a 'Holt, Plant & Deakin' pub and has been removed in recent times. The room has an original ornate plasterwork ceiling now painted brown. The bay window fixed seating looks to be from the post war period \u2013 there was no fixed seating on the 1900 plan. On the 1983 \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 plans there was a section of seating in the rear left part of the room but this has since been removed and it must have been added after 1900 anyway. \r\n\r\nThe position of the bar back fitting creates a passageway for access to the rear smoke room (which continued until 1983 after which it is accessed via an arch cut into the rear wall of the public bar). It may have been used by stand-up drinkers in the passageway? The snob screens are situated here as a way of ensuring folks who drank in the smoke room could not be viewed by the occupants of the public bar and visa versa. There is a dado of golden yellow coloured tiling on the passageway side of the bar back fitting. On the right hand part of the back fitting i.e. close to the front door, there is some plain wood panels clearly added later - it is likely there was an off sales hatch here originally? \r\n\r\nThe smoke room retains a good portion of its old fixed seating with bell pushes in a wood panel above, but the seating and the baffles, particularly the stained and leaded panel in the top looks more inter-war - they are totally different to the Art Nouveau style on the bar back fitting. There is what looks like an original wood surround to the fireplace but a modern tiled and cast-iron hearth has been added which houses a gas \u2018coal-effect\u2019 fire. The smoke room is served from a small hatch / bar with original counter front. The smoke room remained little altered until 1983 at the time it became one of Allied Breweries \u2018Holt, Plant & Deakin\u2019 pubs. There are plans on the wall of the smoke room detailing the 1983 changes. The tiny seating alcove on the right was added in 1983 in what was originally a passage to the rear. The fixed seating on the right hand side was removed to create access to the new small room at the rear via an arch. \r\n\r\nThe new small rear room and new toilets beyond were built on the site of two bottle stores and the outside toilets. The new rear room has some fixed seating which could be the section removed from the smoke room but the dado paneling is new. \r\n\r\nHistoric details courtesy of Pevsner Architectural Guides: Birmingham and the Black Country', by Andy Foster, Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandraa Wedgwood.

        "Pub Name": "Mug House",
        "Address": "Claines Lane, Claines, WR3 7RN",
        "Description": "A difficult to find three-roomed pub hidden away behind the village churchyard, this part-timber-framed building dates back to 15th- or 16th century. It originally had a plain brick frontage, as the photos in the bar show, and in the 1980s it was replaced with one of false timber-framing with new brick infill. Parts of the interior have not changed much since the late 1930s. A quarry-tiled passage with earlier waist-height panelling has a glazed screen with intact sliding hatch for service and is the highlight of the pub.  \r\n\r\nThe smoke room or main bar on the left has a counter reputedly constructed by an apprentice for Rackstraws Furniture Works of Worcester in the 1940s (the pub being popular with the employees of the firm). There is some old panelling and a 1930s brick fireplace, but the two outer walls have lost their panelling and replaced with plasterboard when the windows were renewed in the 1980s. The small snug on the right has a red-brick floor, but otherwise is a 1980s Tudor theme. The lounge at the rear served by a hatch, retains a brick fireplace and a baffle from the 1930s, but the seating looks more 1970s or 80s. The pub has outside toilets in a modern brick extension.  \r\n\r\nThe name 'Mug House' applies to a number of riverside inns in Worcestershire (& South Shropshire) - they flourished with river traffic carrying goods and people - the River Severn has many such pubs. Various explanations exist for the name - Worcestershire Historic Pubs says 'Crude earthenware beer mugs were much favoured by landlords along the river, probably for their low replacement cost if damaged or stolen by passing boatmen compared to expensive glass or pewter ones and the name stuck so a number of them adopted it as the pubs official name. In Britain the use of the word 'Pot' as in 'Pint Pot' harks back to the use of similar pottery mugs.'",

        "Pub Name": "Bush",
        "Address": "4 Bull Ring, St Johns, Worcester, WR2 5AD",
        "Description": "A lovely, small corner site pub built in 1879 of brick which in the early 1900s was remodelled with the addition of a new servery and bar fittings by Yates and Greenways of Birmingham. The public bar was subdivided by a screen into two compartments and another screen separated a new Jug And Bottle in the rear section of the public bar. A former living room on the rear left was converted into a smoke room. Following these alterations the outdoor department at the front left of the pub was effectively closed but despite this, there were still a few customers in recent years that used the front passage to drink in! \r\n\r\nAfter a number of years of ownership by Enterprise Inns, which saw the pub have periods of closure as tenants struggled to run it viably, it was sold in 2013. While the new owners have sensible plans to convert the upper floors into flats and retain this as a pub by charging a modest rent to make it viable they have made some changes to its historic interior. \r\n\r\nThe pub was acquired by the Cannon Royall brewery in 2015.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s the partitions that created two sections in the public bar and a separate jug and bottle were removed - you can easily see the two indentations in the counter top indicating the former positions of the screens which originally divided the room - the door with a decorative etched glass containing the wording 'JUG & BOTTLE / DEPT / on Bush Walk was blocked up and a new sliding door cut out of the rear wall giving access to the passageway leading to the smoke room and the toilets. Prior to this new door being added customers had to walk out of the corner door and back into the pub via the side door in order to access the toilets. \r\n\r\nThe left hand door (no longer in use) leads into a passage with a decorative etched glass containing the wording 'Smoke Room & Out Door Dept.' leads into a passage with tongue and grooved boarding, also red and cream tiles laid diagonally. At the end of the passage on the right was the \u2018Outdoor Department\u2019 with intact rising hatch with stained and leaded panels and just before it a two-part stained and leaded window. In early 2014 both the hatch and the window were removed to create a walkway between the public bar and the passage and through the door into the Smoke Room. \r\n\r\nThe public bar retains its servery from the early 1900s which is of an inverted L-shape so it faces both Bull Ring and Bush Walk. The bar counter front is comprised of fielded panels divided by scrolled pilasters topped with carved reliefs with floral and foliage motifs. It has an excellent bar back with a prominent pedimented feature - it has two twisted columns with composite capitals and scrolled console brackets topped with ball finials supporting a deep frieze and a moulded cornice. Above the cornice is a balustrade. The bar back turns the corner by way of a rounded corner piece which is embellished with a moulded, triangular pediment with a tympanum containing a carved scrollwork relief incorporating floral and foliage motifs. Below the pediment is a clock set within a moulded surround of which the spandrels contain carved reliefs with floral and foliage motifs. The clock bears the wording 'YATES & GREENWAYS / BAR FITTERS / BIRMINGHAM'. To the bar back wall there is a series of round-headed arches to which 1960/70s mosaic mirror tiles have been added, also fluted keystones and spandrels with carved scrollwork reliefs with floral and foliage motifs. Very little of the lower shelves remain as most have been replaced by fridges. \r\n\r\nThe bare wood floor room also retains its early 20th century fixed seating re-leatheretted, one draught screen, bell pushes, moulded cornice and anaglypta ceiling. The corner entrance has a wooden vestibule with stained and leaded panels in the door and along the top \u2013 note the indentations which indicate the position of the former screens. The ground floor windows have original (or good replacement) decorative etched glass; the exception being the replacement window to Bush Walk which is of a similar style to the originals but with the wording 'THE / BUSH / INN'. The original fireplace has been replaced by a Victorian \u2013style one. \r\n\r\nThe side entrance door on Bush Walk leads into a passage with tongue and grooved boarding, red and cream tiles laid diagonally, and a door with a hatch to the servery. Situated at the end of the corridor is the smoke room, which is also accessed from a corridor from the front left-hand side door on Bull Ring. The doors to the smoke room contain early 1900\u2019s decorative etched glass with the wording 'SMOKE / ROOM' whilst the room itself retains its bell pushes and fixed seating with scrolled and fluted legs and a draught screen. A small plaque attached to the seating bears the inscription 'MANUFACTURED BY / YATES & GREENWAYS / 39 TO 42 COLESHILL ST / BIRMINGHAM. Set into the wall is a hatch providing access to the servery in the public bar \u2013 and due the loss of a small portion of fixed seating which was probably done in the 1960/70s it is possible to stand at the hatch to the back of the servery. However, in 2014 an ugly white radiator has been placed in front of the hatch and a pie warmer behind it so it is no longer in use for service. While the mantelpiece looks to date from the early 20th century, the fireplace is a 1960s replacement. In 2014 a new door was added to the rear of the smoke room to give access to the yard and necessitated the removal of a small piece of the fixed seating. \r\n\r\nAt the rear right the landlord\u2019s private living room was opened-up to the rear passage and converted into a pool room in the late 1980s and has a reproduction Victorian fireplace. Modernised toilets at rear. On the first floor there is a former billiards room at the front which retains some fixed seating and a bell push but was converted into a dining room some years ago. At least two of the first floor front windows had decorative etched glass displaying the word 'BILLIARDS' but in 2014 they were replaced by plain glass as part of the conversion of the upper floors to flats. Also upstairs the rear function room become a kitchen.",

        "Description": "A good attractive example of an interwar makeover in the 'Olde English' style. Rebuilt in c.1760, the two upper storeys are pinkish-orange brick Georgian work but on the ground floor in comes a wealth of timber work from the 1920s or 30s. The interior is really quite small but consists of three separate rooms. The most interesting of them is the 'Panelled bar' at the rear left with the figure '6' on the door. The walls are completely covered full-height sixteenth/seventeenth-century-style panelling (the listing description states \"c.1900 panelling and boxed beams). There is a Tudor-style stone fireplace, a little colourful stained glass in the top section of the exterior windows with the centre one depicting a cardinal's hat, fixed benches around the walls with bell pushes above and an intact hatch in a door to the back of the servery. The rear room has a new stone floor, which has replaced a 1920/30s concrete one. A passage runs from the front door which has \"lounge\" on it - the left and right hand doors which led to the public bar and snug respectively are no longer in use. From the open staircase in the centre to the rear the passage has an old dado (date unknown) of panelling with lozenge decoration topped by a wide enough ledge to place your glass. \r\n\r\nAt the front right is a small snug with a no. 7 on the door has imitation half-timbering on the walls from inter-war times, a lot of leaded exterior windows but the exterior door to this room is no longer in use and there are no old fittings. The front left main bar with a no. 5 on the door from the passage (it also has an exterior door) also has imitation half-timbering on the walls from inter-war times and a stone chimney-piece with a 4-centred arch, a plaster relief of a cardinal's hat above and floral decoration either side of it. What looks like an old bar was added in a sensitive refurbishment by Banks's brewery in 1996, the bar back is modern and it has a wooden floor. \r\n\r\nThe gents\u2019 at the rear right has a \u2018Gentlemens Lavatory\u2019 copper name panel above the door, inter-war black and white chequerboard tiled floor and inter-war tiled walls but some around new urinals are modern. The ladies\u2019 has a \u2018Ladies Lavatory\u2019 copper name panel above the door and inter-war tiled walls to two-thirds height. After a spell known as the 'Austrian Bar' dedicated to the sale of Austrian beers in 0.3 litre, half litre and litre sized glasses, in 2013 it reopened selling a range of local real ales. There are plans to add B&B accommodation in the rooms above.",

The bare-boarded bar has a panelled Victorian counter with brackets, fine bar back with barley twist columns and including gilded glass panels and topped with a clock, fixed seating but the etched windows in this room are replacements.

        "Address": "Lichfield Avenue, Worcester, WR5 1PE",
        "Description": "Built in 1958 - opening date may be 1 December 1958 - this is a rare example of a barely altered 1950s pub with four rooms and off sales (no longer in use). The front left entrance leads to a lobby with original tiled walls (the toilets here are also unchanged). The public bar on the right with a quarry tiled floor retains its original bar counter, bar back, brick fireplace and fixed seating. There's a rather odd arrangement in the far right corner where a long recess accommodates the dartboard and the seating curves round to protect it, but we reckon that's the way it's always been. \nSmoke room on the left has original counter, bar back, classic 1950/early 60s tiled fireplace and fixed seating. Just beyond that is the former off-sales which is essentially intact with its tiled dado, bar counter and bar back fitting but the front door on the left hand side of the building has been blocked up and the room is now an office and can only be viewed by request to the licensee. To the right of the bar is a small pool room, formerly known as the \"blue room\" and which again has its original bar fittings and seating though there is new floor tiling next to the counter. Toilets in this area are also unchanged apart from modern wall tiles.  \r\n\r\nThe big function room at the back has seen the most change. The bar counter has a new top and new panelling but the originals survive underneath. The bar back shelving looks less than convincing but is the same as in the off-sales so must be presumed to be kosher. At the rear is a skittle alley, accessed from the function room, which was added 20/30 years ago and this necessitated blocking up of a window. It can be carpeted over and used as a second or extension to the function room. As you'd expect, all the fittings are utilitarian and entirely redolent of the period. The intactness of both these fittings and the planform make this a precious survivor, especially as it still fulfils its function as a social centre for the estate which surrounds it.",

The dining room was converted from a cattle barn in the mid-1980s; the small ante-room between it and the second bar is where a roadway used to lie between pub and barn.",

        "Address": "248 Werrington Road, Stoke-on-Trent, Bucknall, ST2 9AW",
        "Description": "Built in the 1930s with a white (Portland?) stone ground floor and brick first floor, it retains it a little altered interior of four rooms. The lobby has a dado of 1930s tiling on the left hand side and as you enter the off sales is still there with the only change being the replacement of the hatch by a fixed window. On the right is the public bar with a 1930s panelled counter, a bar back with 1930s and more modern work, original fixed seating in two sections, but a modern brick fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe left hand door leads to the most intact room called the 'Chapel of Rest' which is narrow and retains inter-war panelling on the walls with bell pushes all the way around, original bar counter and bar back, the fixed seating has seen some changes and the fireplace has been replaced with an inappropriate Victorian-style one. Sadly in 2016 it is not in use but visible from the lobby bar. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is the lobby bar with a dado of fielded panelling all around the walls and original bar counter. The gents off here has original tiled floor & Twyfords urinals, but new wall tiles and the ladies also has an original tiled floor. At the rear the former music room with no old fittings now contains a full sized snooker table.",

        "Description": "This one-room town centre local was refitted in the early 1960s and has barely been altered since. Many pubs in the UK received a similar treatment but the vast majority have since been refurbished making the interior of the Unicorn rare. It has 1960s mock-Tudor fake beams and half timbering on the walls; a bar counter with a copper top; red upholstered fixed seating; copper top tables; and a small alcove at the rear. Prior to the 1960s it would have been two small separate rooms - the centrally placed front door is no longer in use. The pub operates as a theatre bar to the Regent across the road - fill in a card with your interval drinks and they will be on the bar when you take your break and a 5 minute warning bell is rung to ensure you get back to your seat in time. Look for the 'rails' in the passageway on the left used to roll barrel of beer to the cellar; and the plaque on the barometer which is upside down!",

        "Description": "The structure is late 16th century with a partial timber-frame. It incorporates the former court house of the Manor of Newcastle-under-Lyme. In 1936 a Mrs E A Pattinson sold the Greyhound to Parkers of Burslem brewery who reconstructed the pub and its three roomed interior is little altered since. The right hand entrance leads into the lounge bar which has a 16th century inglenook fireplace with cambered head originally in another room. It contains a very old Tudor arch shaped stone with brick fireplace with wood surrounds and seats either either side. The bar counter looks like the 1930s one painted black and there is an old high backed settle, but the bar back is modern. \r\n\r\nA doorway on the right leads to a crackin' little snug which has completely panelled walls from the 16th century, bell pushes, and plain baffles either side of the entrance. It has a mainly red tiled floor, there is a small 1930s brick fireplace with carving in the panelling above and fixed seating with barley twist arms and legs at least 70 years old. \r\n\r\nTo the rear right of the lounge bar is a small area with a Victorian-style fireplace and a door to a passage which leads to the public bar on the left. This larger room has a dado of 1930s fielded panelling including on the bar counter front, both recently painted a cream colour, a baffle with leaded panel by the front entrance  and a number of good ceiling roses. However the fireplace has been replaced and the bar back is modern. \r\n\r\nThe nearby Marquis of Granby retains a colourful tiled dado on the left hand wall of the lobby and the public bar has what could be an old bar back with mirrors and possibly an old counter.",

The inner lobby retains a two-part off-sales window with a lower panel that can rise. The public bar on the left has a parquet floor and long bar counter with panels that look to have been added in around 1960 between older pilasters that are painted black but the bar top only dates from the 1980/90s. The bar back looks to have seen changes in the 1960s with some copper panels, there is a c.1960 brick fireplace, some old bench seating in the rear narrow part of the room and old beamed ceiling. The lounge bar on the right looks to have been last altered in inter-war times with its unusual bar counter of rustic vertical panels, a tiled and Art Deco wood-surround fireplace, a bar back fitting with curved Art Deco-style top but later changes have seen some of it removed so staff can both walk between the two serveries as well as viewing more of each room. There are even the odd table and bench that look to be of a 'publican rustic' style from the 1930s.",

        "Address": "On B4202, Pensax, WR6 6AE",
        "Description": "Up to 1980 the Bell ran on incredible traditional lines with a rare 'parlour bar'* (now the snug) and on a visit today it is easy to visualise how it worked. A brick and mock-Tudor building that was built in 1883, architect John Joseph Jones - look for 1883 and JJJ on the exterior porch. The main inn sign contains a bell cast in 1886 at Loughborough for the bell-tower at Abberley Hall. In the past there was a smallholding (30 acres?) attached and other businesses run from here.  \r\n\r\nThe entrance leads into an L-shaped red tiled floor passage / hall and on the left is a three-bay screen with the lower window of the middle bay open. It was through this window that former licensee Hilda Neath served you beer from three handpumps (now removed) - all selling mild, dark and light, as she didn't sell bitter! Behind the screen, which reaches to the ceiling, is a very small room with a wooden floor, tiled and wood surround fireplace with a log fire and above is a delicate mantelpiece including bevelled mirror sections. High up on the left-hand wall are two shelves for displaying bottles etc. In the past this room operated as a private parlour to which selected customers could be invited to drink with the landlady and benefit from the coal fire.* Other customers would buy their drinks through the hatch and drink them in the passage/hall.  \r\n\r\nThe other historic rooms are that on the front right, which would be used when it got busy, and behind it separated by sliding or concertina doors a small room used for darts or dominoes but otherwise rarely open. These two rooms now form the main bar having been joined together in around 1980 and the bar counter and back added; the dado panelling being old. The small bar counter in the hall also dates from c.1980. On the left is a dining room formed of 2/3 former private rooms.  \r\n\r\n*There are three remaining examples of a room where customers can sit while staff are serving from the same area - the 'Inner Sanctum ' at the Bridge, Topsham, Devonwhich is for use by selected customers only; the 'Select ' at the Arden Arms, Stockport, Greater Manchester; and the 'Snug ' at Ye Horns Inn, Goosnagh, Lancashire, all have Nationally Important Historic interiors.",

        "Description": "Three-storey house built c.1800 then converted to an inn. It was the Shakespeare until the 1990s and served as the interval pub for the nearby theatre. Although the ground floor room layout has been compromised there is much left from a good quality refurbishment in the 1950s, no doubt by Hunt Edmunds who owned the pub from 1936. On the left the walls are covered in panelling that is of a distinctive 1950s style (might be earlier) - a dado of vertical strips and fielded panelling with larger panels up to picture frame height. The semi island bar counter front has a 1950s style, the top could be of that date and the brick fireplace is a distinctive 1950s one. On the right the smaller room / area has a different style of panelling on the dado only now painted light grey, there is another 1950s brick fireplace and some fixed seating which may be of a similar date. The bar back fitting is modern. The door to the gents' loo has an old leaded glass window with some dimpled glass and 50s style diagonal lettering.\r\n\r\nAt the rear a staircase with good dado panelling matching the main bar right hand side style (and left hand side top panels) leads to a function room on the first floor. This Baronial-style room has panelling to the same design as downstairs (fielded pattern below, larger indented panels above) but has, unfortunately, been painted. The small items of pargetting depict heraldic devices - rose, lion, Fleur-de-lys, harp etc.",

It is a three-bay affair with mirrored sections, balustrade and a clock at the top. Fine pillars hold up the shelves and there has been no loss of lower shelves for fridges. The bar counter looks old but it is not of a quality that matches the bar back so looks to be of a more recent date. There is some old fixed seating in the small right area but also a new stone bar counter and modern fireplace. The bigger bar on the left has another modern bar counter, fireplace and fixed seating.

In the 1930s it served what was called Grimley Lido, a section of the River Severn south of Bevere Lock that became very popular at that time for sunbathing and swimming.   \r\n\r\nThe small right-hand bar has a red tiled floor, a small, possibly 1930s brick fireplace with a log fire, a bar counter that could date from the 1930s as there is a date of 1936 on the set of Gaskell & Chambers hand-pumps (but the counter front could have later replacement timber following flooding). The bar back is modern - an old (1950\u2019s?) photo behind the bar shows the same counter but an older bar-back fitting. The bar area has been increased in size by a small 1970s extension on the river side of the pub.  \r\n\r\nThe larger left room has a red-brick shaped tiled floor, a large 1930s brick fireplace with a copper hood, a large high-backed settle and service from a hatch cut into a wall where the counter could date from the 1930s. The panelling \u2013 dado and some full height \u2013 is modern having been replacements after flooding. There is a tiny alcove in the 1970s extension part of the room.  \r\n\r\nFrom the (rear) entrance on the car park side is a small hall with red tiled floor, intact off sales hatch and split door with ledge leading to the servery for staff. There is more replacement after flooding timber dado here and down the uneven tiled floor passage to the public bar. On the opposite side of the passage to the public bar is a small snug brought into use with a tiled floor, replacement after flooding timber dado, modern brick fireplace and old looking benches. Plenty of 1930s Crittall windows remain. Outside gents.  \r\n\r\nThe pub gets flooded regularly and can be closed for months so best to ring ahead before making a visit.",

Good chimney-piece with curved wooden architrave then recent tiling but original grate. The back of the former off-sales can still be observed through an internal window. Ahead from the hall, the dining room/lounge has been much modernised with a new counter and bar back at the far end replacing a hatch to the servery behind, but the fireplace looks original.

        "Description": "The pub is part of a late 18th century terrace and has a most unusual arrangement of rooms. The entrance door is in the centre of the pub and opens on to a Victorian floor tiled passageway . There is a hatch from the bar on the left hand wall and a glasses shelf on the same wall which indicates passageway drinking at some in the past. There are two wooden sliding doors at either end of the passage that both lead into the main room, an suggestion that is was formerly two separate rooms. The bar counter with its rustic black & white wood and plaster frontage was installed in the 1980s to replace the previous counter but the bar back with plain wooden shelves and mirror mosaic back appears to be 1960s work. There is fixed seating along the three walls opposite the bar area. \r\n\r\nThe main claim to fame for this pub however is the two small rooms to the right of the entrance. The first of the two rooms has fixed seating installed in the late 1980s, a small brick 1950s fireplace, and a glazed screen and door separating it from the passageway. \r\n\r\nThe second room is larger, again with 1980s fixed seating, and glazed screen and door. However, the glazing here is far older with a bowed frontage reminiscent of a Dickensian shop.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the rooms is unclear but the tale is that there were courtrooms and the prisoners were kept in what is now the pub cellar. Be that as it may they are certainly a rare feature, the nearest comparison being the rear booths at the Bull, Paisley.\r\n\r\nThe entrance passageway continues to the rear of the pub where there is a very large function room with its own bar and an adjacent skittle alley.",

When built the plan consisted of a lobby with the beer store on the right, public bar on the far right, Outdoor Department on the near left, Gents Smoking Room on the front left and Assembly Room on the rear left.\n\r\nFrom the entrance lobby the left hand door now leads to a large lounge bar due to walls being removed between the Outdoor Department, Gents Smoking Room and Assembly Room. Just inside the room the curved counter of the off sales with a horizontal panelled front appears to be the original. You can see where the original door to the Gents Smoking Room was situated and fixed seating in this area might be original and re-upholstered. There is an Art Deco style wood surround and tiled fireplace that is modern.\n\r\nIn the rear former Assembly Room with a wooden floor and small stage on the left the counter with a horizontal panelled front appears to be the original and the bar back of wood panels with mirrors is a mixture of original and modern work. Unusual curved bench near the rear semi-circular windows is original. The room retains original plaster cornice and mouldings, radiator housing, moderne decorative smoke extractor grilles to ceiling, and metal windows. On the far left is a wide lobby which was the original entrance to the Assembly Room and has toilets (modernised) off with some terrazzo flooring.\n\r\nOn the right the public bar has a wooden floor, the bar counter look to be the original as does the top. The bar back top section has mirrors and wood that look modern whereas the main shelf looks original. (most of lower shelves lost to fridges) The fixed seating in three sections look original and the ceiling has moderne plaster mouldings There looks to be some changes to the area just inside the room on the lobby side. The bowling green at the rear is still in regular use.\n\r\nA Plaque on the exterior reads \u201cThe Maggies has a sister pub, also in Hall Green called The Baldwin, also designed by E.F. Reynolds. A profile of the front elevation of the two pubs placed side by side, with The Maggies on the left would reveal another important and prestigious part of history as the design was based on The Queen Mary cruise liner launched by Cunard White Star on September 26th 1934, undertaking her maiden voyage on May 27th 1936. Fortunately The Maggies and The Baldwin have stood the test of time a little better as The Queen Mary was decommissioned on October 5th 1971.\u201d (The interior of the Baldwin was gutted in the 1990s.)",

Behind the servery is a bare snug (now a pool room) with hatch service and modern timber dados painted white.

        "Description": "Stone built pub of 1616 with alterations in 1874 (these dates are inscribed on the building itself). This is  three-roomed, of considerable character and is little altered due to the long stewardship of a Mr & Mrs Castledine for 50 years until 1987 and then former tenants Paul & Evie Burlinson who retired in 2008. Enter the inner lobby with an old quarry tiled floor and old dado panelling under a hatch that looks like the off-sales. The main bar on the right has a quarry tiled floor and superb inglenook cast iron range fireplace with a collection of brass items. Look for the front window which can be opened \u2013 it is believed to be there so that the licensee could give a drink to the coach driver! \r\n\r\nThere were changes to the bar counter in c.1953 but the old frontage remains; the opening on the right hand side was the original hatch and there are signs of where some shutters were removed from the upper part; the larger left hand opening dates from c.1953, which is the date on the Gaskell & Chambers set of handpumps situated near the off sales hatch. The bar counter may be more modern. The lower bar back fitting is old (note the old bottle opener) but the shelves directly above were added in recent years (1980/90s we were told), however, there are some very old shelves on the (partition) wall alongside the off sales hatch. The benches around the room look at least 70 years old and have no proper back, but a beam across the top \u2013 one has a back that moves from one side to the other in the same way as benches on trams!; the scrubbed top tables are at least 50 years old. The timeless nature of this room is emphasised by the row of pewter mugs hanging from the beams and an old ticking clock. \r\n\r\nThe room to the right side of the pub has a parquet floor, probably interwar. It is fully panelled with the majority of the fielded panelling appears to be from the 17th century, quite possibly installed in 1616. Note how the original fireplace to the east side has been covered up and a newer one installed on the opposite side of the room, which was possibly done in the interwar period (assuming parquet floor is of this time; also change of ownership happened in 1937 and most new owners make some changes!). The original exterior entrance to this room is locked out of use - the interior part is located behind a curtain on the north wall. \r\n\r\nThe quarry tiled-floored room on the left was brought into use in c.1952 being the old kitchen hence the range fireplace. The high backed settle which is raised at one end came from the Queen Adelaide, Snelston Common, near Ashbourne when it closed in 2001. The room is served by a split door with shelf \u2013 it is rare to see the top part of the door intact as it is here. A former meeting room upstairs is no longer in use.",

The pub consists of two distinctive parts \u2013 the top part is a 16th century half timbered building and was incorporated into the pub in the mid 19th century. It houses a very small high ceilinged bar with a counter from the 1950s, newer top and fixed seating that looks to date from the 1930s. Note the small \u2018Royal Oak\u2019 stained panels high up in the exterior windows. The lower and larger bar was the original inn and consisted of two rooms originally \u2013 it was bought by Stones Brewery of Sheffield in 1897 who carried out an extensive renovation. Again the bar fittings are about 50 years old.",

It was last refitted in c.1960 and has been barely changed since. There is an off sales hatch as you enter. To the left the small lounge bar appears to have been enlarged in c.1960 by absorbing a passageway at the rear hence the wide arch cut into a wall and beyond this is some fixed seating of the same style as that in the rest of the room. In common with refits of the early 1960s it has a bar counter fronted in  stone and in 2005 the Formica top was replaced by  one of carved oak. The bar back looks very 1960s with its glass shelves and there is a brick fireplace of the type seen in the 1950s, and fixed seating is of a 1950/60s style;  even the red Formica tables remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the small Tramway room on the right service is via a small hatch with double windows and a stone counter front situated on a tiled plinth. There is a small Tudor arch shaped ceramic fireplace of c.1960, more fixed seating of a 1950/60s style. The gents' survived the refit unaltered.",

These were the first of the workers' houses erected by Arkwright and mark an important stage in the development of the textile industry and workers' housing in that they provided both accommodation on the ground and first floors for the workers at his new Cromford Mill and workshop space on the second floor which ran from one end of the street to the other. The Bell retains three rooms and is little altered in 50 years. The tiny snug accessed from Cromford Hill has a quarry tiled floor, old fixed seating with a more modern backing and is served from a hatch. Up to 2009 there was also an off sales hatch in this area. The public bar retains old fitted benches still with the makers labels \u2018T. Greaves & Co., House Furnishers & Upholsterers, Alfreton\u2019 but the bar counter is modern. On the left with its own entrance from North Street is the lounge, which was created out of a private sitting room in the late 1950s. It still retains a distinct 1950s bar counter front and Formica top, fixed seating from the 1950s, an old stone fireplace and piano, but the bar back-fitting is modern.",

Formerly the Middleton Hotel, the original inn sign still sits in the garden. It was always known by locals as the Dew Drop and the name was changed in 1991. It has an unaltered layout of a central drinkers' lobby with three rooms off, and most of the interior features date from a remodelling in the 1950s.\n\r\nTo the left of the entrance is the corner public bar. This was originally accessed from its own external door on the corner of the building prior to the 1950s. In this room, the 1950s features are a counter of light oak (or ash), mirrored bar-back with original shelving to the floor, and leatherette fixed seating with a baffle near the door. The bench seating around the outer walls may pre-date the 1950s work. The bar-back has an opening between this and the rear room, each side having a small till drawer attached to the shelves.\n\r\nThe large lobby with 1950s quarry tiled floor and open staircase has a servery consisting of a sliding hatch, which still works but is locked into an open position, with windows either side and another 1950s bar front with wooden top.\n\r\nThe rear lounge has a similar 1950s counter and bar-back shelving, plus bench seating all round. The free-standing tables and stools are almost certainly survivors from the 1950s modernisation. A modern brick fireplace and projecting wood-burning stove has been introduced into the lounge, replacing a modern reproduction fireplace.\n\r\nThe third room off the lobby is a separate snug-lounge. This has fixed seating of 1950s vintage in four bays but with plush modern upholstery, a modern reclaimed brick fireplace, and modern fake half-timbering on Artex walls. The two upper window panels have the outline of old cemented-on white lettering \"STRETTON'S DERBY ALES\".\n\r\nThe off sales was situated between the lounge and public bars which is now a kitchen, but the exterior door remains. The Gents' toilets are unmodernised but very plain. Finally, note the brass plaque in the lobby which states \"Sir Barnes Neville Wallis 1897-1979 slept here during WWII\".

A relatively large lobby, partially tiled with plain brown tiles, part panelled and giving access to all other rooms and the staircase, is dominated by the servery whose oaken bar front has a replacement top. The floor plan is substantially intact but a room to the rear of the servery has been converted to kitchen use and another small room (devoid of fittings) may not originally have been in public use. There are entrances at both ends of what is, in effect, an L shaped corridor round the bar counter. The rear lounge is delightful with bench seating having turned legs and turned spindles supporting the arm rails, with bell pushes above. The tiled fire surround is embellished by an overmantel with a pie crust (ish) shaped mirror. The seating was originally arranged  to include a piano (opposite the fireplace), which was recently bought by the next-door neighbours. This room and the gents retain original oaken doors. The front lounge has lost most features but a tiled fire surround remains. There is a pierced-work  F Robinson's floor mat inset in the front entrance.",

        "Description": "Built of red brick as a 6 bedroom hotel in 1886 for Messrs Pountain, Giradot and Forman, local wine merchants - note 1886 and letters P G & F high up on the Society Street side. It was designed by Derby architect James Wright and built by local firm Messrs Walker & Slater. In the 1933 a decision was taken to switch to operating only as a pub and changes were made. The public bar in the angle to the street retains its Victorian bar counter with a series of support posts and a Formica top over the original one. The fine intact bar back is of two sections - a quarter circle one on the left and straight piece on the right. This small room also retains original seating and a replacement cast and tiled fireplace. Part of the wall has been removed to give access to the original off sales, which is now disused. \r\n\r\n\r\nA doorway leads to the rear bar, originally a small room with bare wood floor and old, possibly original, wood bench seating in two parts. You can just about see the line of the original bar counter which has been replaced by a 1950s/60s one and there is a modern cast fireplace. Take a close look at the right hand seating and you will notice changes - up to the 1930s the window on the right was a door leading to the outside toilets. The wall to the former living room at the rear has been removed and this area now houses a pool table. The hotel front door originally led to the reception and the right hand door to the residents' lounge. In 1933 the wall between the two was removed and a small curved counter installed in the rear left corner. The present bar counter and bar back only date from the 1990s. However, the original Victorian fixed seating and cast fireplace with log fire still remain and this bar is open evenings and weekends and is usually accessible only from indoors.",

The bar counter appears to date from the time of the extension. There is another doorway with decorative woodwork but the bar back is modern. There is 1920/30s 'Ladies' stained glass door panel and as this is in the extension it must have been moved. Both gents toilets have the original urinals and terrazzo floors.",

        "Description": "Set back from the road and rendered all over, this building has been a pub since 1865. An excellent four roomed village pub that saw some significant changes in the mid 1950s and few alterations since, having been run by Olive Wilson and her family  since 1953. From the front door a passage with ply panelling on the walls and an old settle leads to the public bar in the middle of the pub. The bar counter of classic 50s design and with a red Formica top replaced the original wood and glass screen with just a serving hatch in the middle of it - they claim to have retained most of the old panels in the loft! There are two sections of bar back with Formica shelves also added in the mid 50s. On the front left is the splendid Tap Room, so called because it was here that locals used to tap coins on their glasses when they wanted serving. It has a '1' painted on the door, a red quarry tiled floor, fixed seating from the early 20th century which has been re-upholstered and a classic 1930s tiled fireplace.\r\n\r\nOn the right is another delightful room - the very small snug with '2' painted on the door. It has a tiny hatch in the old partitioned wall to the servery, a small tiled fireplace from the early 20th century and leatherette covered fixed seating from the mid 50s. At the rear is the lounge which was extended back to double its size in 1999. The original front section has what looks like a inglenook fireplace and the carpet covers a parquet floor. Note that the fixed seating in the rear section is a copy of the original early 20th century seating in the front section. To the rear left is the Assembly Room added in 1911 with a bare wood floor and two fireplaces, one with glazed bricks. There is a bar added in 1993 - you can still see the 1955 bar back on the wall of the black and red tiled passage to the toilets. At the front of the pub the outside toilets still remain, as does the original outside gents opposite them.",

The off sales is situated on the far left of the pub and is still intact but no longer in use (there is also access from the rear left of the public bar). \r\n\r\nOn the left is the original public bar (has a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 on a panel on the bay window) which is no longer in use, except for functions and table tennis three nights a week. It has lost its original fixed seating (although the landlord does retain the section of seating that belongs around the bay window, so it could be re-instated). An additional door has been cut into one wall to make it easier to access the toilets. The room has a parquet floor, original bar counter (unable to see rest of servery as it is currently used for storage). \r\n\r\nThe bar (has a \u2018Saloon Bar\u2019 label on the door!) in the middle is now the main bar and has two sets of original 1930s fixed bench seating with a single surviving bell push. Originally served via a hatch, this was replaced with the present bar counter with its red Formica top in the 1960s. There is a passageway on the rear right with a dado of 1930s brown tiles with the toilets and cellar off it. The gents are nearly intact \u2013 only some of the dado wall tiles are modern. \r\n\r\nThe smoke room on the right retains its 1930s brick fireplace and original bench seating (has been boxed-in) with a baffle. The counter looks like the original 1935 one, as does the working clock (electric) but only the bottom part of the bar back is original, the top section looks more 1960s work. Original doors with leaded door glass which retain their room numbers - \u20181\u2019 on the middle lounge; \u20182\u2019 on the public bar; \u20184\u2019 on a door to the passageway at rear; \u20185\u2019 on the off sales; and \u20186\u2019 on the cellar; only a \u20183\u2019 on the right bar is missing, but the landlord says he may have it somewhere. \r\n\r\nWhile in Pleasley visit the White Swan to see the remains of its 1930s refit.",

A pub that has resisted changes \u2013 indeed previous owners Ken & Barbara Littleproud bought the pub from Bass in 1992 to stop them ruining the unspoilt interior. This late 18th or early 19th century red brick pub retains its original floor plan of off-sales, drinking passageway with bar, rare partitioned snug, a small lounge that you can now only access by walking through part of the servery and a separate snug. Go up a short flight of steps to the front door and beyond it is the (now disused) off sales hatch. The quarry tiled passage that runs to the rear has a bar counter with panelled front that is not easy to date and has a copper top. The existence of old shelves on the walls indicates passageway drinking and the bar back consists of old shelving. \r\n\r\nThe star here is the snug on the left of the passage created by a floor to ceiling part glazed curved partition wall. There are very few rooms like this left in the whole of the UK. It has a red and black quarry tiled floor with bench seating attached to it and the walls; a tiled and marble effect fireplace from the 1920s and just two tables. Note the letter \u2018B\u2019 on the door \u2013 in the past licensing magistrates insisted on all rooms for public use be numbered but here, unusually, they use letters. (The cellar has a \u2018D\u2019 on it). \r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the Holly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; Green Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; Red Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; North Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; Kings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; Bell & Cross, Holy Cross, Worcestershire; Old White Beare, Norwood Green, Yorkshire, West;  Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;;  Crown, Snape, Suffolk;;  Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;;  Galway Arms, East Retford, Nottinghamshire;; andAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .\r\n\r\nFurther along on the left beyond a low doorway is the small tap room. It has a tiled and marble effect fireplace from the 1920s and benches which could date from the 1950/1960s. On the right a dog-leg in the passage past the cellar door and through the corner of the servery is the lounge with fixed seating possibly of the 1950s, which is the date of the brick fireplace. There is another door (now disused) which originally enabled customers to access the room from the passage near the front door. To get served you actually stand alongside bar staff in the servery. In 1990\u2019s(?) the former barn was converted into two further rooms with bars and access is via a passage from near the tap room. The first is a small lounge called the \u2018Tudor Room\u2019 and beyond it a larger room with a full sized billiard table.\r\n\r\nOther Heritage pubs still with full sized billiard tables are the Lamb, Eccles, Manchester, Gtr; and the Douglas Arms, Bethesda, North Wales.",

The room on the left is the 'Sunday room'.  This room is obviously unaltered in d\u00e9cor since the 50s.  The bar looks 50s with fireplace and servery of that era and  a simple drawer used as a till. The tables are probably Edwardian, there is one fixed bench, re-covered; a tiled 50s fireplace with a  coal fire, a Juke Box which only takes old (pre 1997) 50p pieces, 50s and 60s music and brewery signs from Ind Coope, Ruddles, Harp, Double Diamond and Bass complete the scene.  The place could do with a bit of tlc, but the pupils from Uppingham don't seem to mind, and of course the boys and girls who visit are all over 18!",

        "Description": "Older building refurbished and extended inter-war. Still retains much from the inter-war refit in its 3/4 room and passageway layout. As you enter there is the remains of the off-sales window. To the left is the central servery with quadrant three-light hatch which until the 1970s retained its sliding sashes. Opposite is a splendid small snug area (Moaners corner?) around a 1930s inglenook fireplace with fixed bench seating, fielded panelling and the odd bell push. Note how the left hand side of the panel separating it from the front lobby is shorter and different in style than that on the right - the left side one was removed by a recent licensee but part recovered and re-instated. Beyond the fireplace is another small area with 1930s fixed seating and the odd bell push above it. Originally a separate small snug, recently the partition with door was destroyed by the same license. Note the figure '5' on the cellar door.\n\r\nTo the right of the entrance a door with the figure '2' on it leads to a bare boarded bar revamped in the inter-war period with lovely original fixed bench seating and a baffle by the door. This bar has two substantial Art Deco style upright brick fireplaces and was probably created as one room when the extension went on. The good bar counter could also date from the 1930s (or 1950s). There are four bar back fittings but only the one holding snacks dates from the 1930s the other being post-war/modern. A long central passage runs to the rear of building and has a hatch door for service and a shelf indicating passageway drinking in the past. The kitchen on the left of the passage was formerly the landlord's private living room and the rear lounge/ dining room on right was totally revamped in the 1970s and again in 2000s.",

This is an example of how pubs were refitted in the late 1950s/early 1960s and is unchanged since that time - a remarkable survivor considering its town centre position. The public bar on the right has a lino tiled floor, a bar counter with ribbed hardboard frontage and a Formica top, a bar back that looks more 1950/60s than 1920s, a very 1950s tiled fireplace (with a gas fire in front of it), fixed bench seating, and red Formica topped tables complete the c1960s picture. The door on the left used to give access to the lounge bar, but this is now part of the licensee\u2019s accommodation. Only the 2 \u2018Vaults\u2019 windows on the right and the \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 on the left remain from the c.1920s. Formerly a coaching inn, named after the Earls of Stamford & Warrington, it still retains stables at the rear and the coach arch on the left hand side.

On the left there is some fixed seating and the original 1930s brick fireplace which has a c.1970 inset added. Also, the toilets were moved inside in c.1970. A former landlady told a tale about a lion which escaped from a nearby circus and proceeded to walk past the pub, also the pub did do a 'roaring' trade in liquorice to the locals!!!",

Interestingly, it does have basic wall bench seating along the right hand side of the room which looks old, inset Victorian cupboards but the dado panelling looks modern, The pantry at the end of this room still has the original meat-hooks in the ceiling (not seen).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third room is the quarry tiled floored bar, which does still have the large  still-in-use stove with the flue pipe rising up and out the side of the room, however the bar counter has ply panels added to the front and a Formica top from the 1960s and bar back have been altered probably at the same time and only a piece of original ornate fretwork remains above the bar. Ply panelling was added to the walls in the 1960s and later painted over. Other features in the pub include ornate cornices and moulding in the corridor, sash windows, original doors (new glass).

        "Description": "UPDATE 2018.\n\r\nThe pub closed in May 2013 with the closure of Oakwell Brewery. In early 2018, it reopened under the name 'Shakespeares House' with a completely rebuilt interior involving much rustic woodwork in the right-hand room, and modern decor in the left-hand room. This pub has therefore been re- categorised as Interior Ruined.\n\r\nThe former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\r\nUnusually designed pub built around 1963 for Shipstone's Brewery of Nottingham (Architects R W Cooper & Partners of Nottingham). This a rare survivor of a little altered pub of the post war period with three rooms that can easily be served by one person on a quiet night and an off sales. It was unaltered until 2004 when some changes were made to the public bar servery and double doors to the lounge on the right were removed.\n\r\nIt is a wedge shaped pub built of bricks in a Flemish Bond style (unusual for 1960s buildings which are usually built in a cavity wall style) and which is curved on the right hand elevation. It is three storeys high but only the ground and first floors were completed and the second floor is just a wall. It is believed that the pub was a rebuild as a result of a plan for a major roundabout here - however, at the last moment Leicester City Council changed their mind and decided on an underpass which opened in 1967 leaving the pub's front door only a yard away from a road some 40 feet below!\n\r\nThe central entrance external lobby has two large stone busts of Shakespeare's head in the walls, one either side. It has a rare entrance consisting of two 'walls' of glass each with two doors and two side panels. It retains its original panelled counter (with some minor changes from 2004 such as the shiny gold top section) and ribbed timber-work above with an opening not much bigger than a hatch. The bar back is original but the walls have lost their original panelling.\n\r\nOn the right now opened up to the lobby following removal of the twin glass door is the lounge which is unaltered with a distinct 1960s bar counter front, original bar back fitting, original fixed seating in bays with wooden dividers and copper top tables. Both the gents and ladies are unaltered with terrazzo floors, the gents has Doulton urinals.\n\r\nThe public bar on the left retains its door, original fixed seating but the servery is now only half its original size to create a darts area so only part of the original bar back remains. On the far left the original off sales remains but disused with panelling all around the hatch (now blocked up). The gents here are also unaltered with Doulton urinals.",

Acquired by Leicester City Council in 2015, but not reopened.\n\nMostly intact interior, although the public bar has been extended at the rear and into an adjacent pool annexe. Original windows and doors (some with original painted door glass). Bar on the left - quarry-tiled floor; original counter; good original slatted benches in the bay window (now upholstered, 2012). Central servery - bar-back and bar shelves are very plain, some original, some modern additions; modern shelving above the counter; door and hatch to rear passage. On the right, a small plain lounge-smoke room: service via door and hatch. Gents toilet has white glazed brick walls and roof-light. The pub has suffered at the hands of previous tenants - everything inside painted white, except glass which was black! The last tenant attempted to restore to as original. \n\nDecember 2015: Outline planning permission was granted for a very large redevelopment scheme covering the area around the pub. The permission included demolition of the Ship and a large number of other buildings. However, this was an outline permission for principle, and not a fully worked-out scheme. Leicester's city mayor has been quoted in the Leicester Mercury as follows: \"City mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said it was not certain the pub would be lost. He said: \"I don't think anyone would rush to demolish it unnecessarily. It is a building of considerable local interest. I would be very surprised if a pub or watering hole of some description does not feature in the end development and it may be the current building could serve that purpose.\"\"",

Note the \u2018Gents\u2019 and \u2018Ladies\u2019 signs date from c.1960 but the gents retains its original terrazzo floor. The rear concert room with cornice retains a counter that also looks original with leatherette padding added in the 1960s, more ply panelling wall around the servery, glass bar back shelves indicating 1960s changes and boxed-in fixed seating, difficult to date but could be original. A terrazzo passage leads to the toilets where the gents has a c.1960 sink. The public bar has a plain counter with Formica inlay top so more 1960 than 1938 and the bar back looks 1960s. The room was extended by the purchase of the house next door and there is a Leicestershire Cheese Skittle table in the new part. Replacement windows.",

The right hand bar retains the original bar counter with a rare shallow copper trough running around the base, and original fixed seating with a plain baffle at each end but the bar back is likely to date from c.1986.

There are two more lounges to the rear on the right, with figured wood panelling and the smaller, right-most  lounge retains original bench seating and Art Nouveau-style glazed panels. Some snob screens are said to have been removed as recently as the late 1990s.",

The best part is the lobby behind the main bars, which has a fine staircase, but even here important features have been lost. \n\nThe former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs shows the interior before the work took place. \n\nBuilt 1934 for Home Ales, architects Bailey & Eberlin with a stunning Are Deco exterior. \n\nThe impressive survival inside is the large high ceilinged hallway that sits between the two large bars. Entrance has a tiled floor, twin doors with Art Deco handles and multiple bevelled and non-bevelled glass panes. The large carpeted hallway features a centrepiece of a grand staircase that splits to left and right half way up. Art Deco survivals include the veneer panelling to two-thirds height all around the hall; arches to left and right of staircase to the fine rear passage; good twin doors to the lounge with the figure '2' on them and Art Deco handles; door names of 'The Ship Lounge' and 'Private'; the 1930s 'Ladies' and 'Gentlemen' wording painted on oblong glass panels in the doors; the under stairs broom cupboard that could have been a cloakroom; and 1930s illuminated signs that protrude out above the doors to the rooms. \n\nThe left hand Castleton Bar was originally two rooms until the wall was removed in 2000. The Boulevard Lounge on the right acts as a children's / function room in summer. Neither room has any original fittings.",

        "Description": "The Vine was built in the late eighteenth century as part of the earliest moves to develop Skegness as a place for sea-bathing. Much of its present character is imparted by a 1930s refurbishment. Off the panelled hotel hall is the 'Tennyson Bar', commemorating the locally-born poet. This has a low-level dado all round and a very attractive hatch counter with a timber apron and surround - all probably from the 1930s; the fireplace doesn't match, and is probably relatively modern repro. No fixed seating.\r\n\r\nA passage off the 'Tennyson Bar' leads to the 'Oak Room' on the right; this also has its own entrance and lobby with leaded glass, and a 1930s gents' toilet off the lobby with original features, including a bank of three Adamant urinals with interesting plumbing. The Oak Room has panelling all round, almost to ceiling height, and a 1930s brick fireplace unfortunately painted a rather garish maroon. The chunky counter looks to be relatively old, but it doesn't fit the style of the room. Again, no fixed furniture; however, most of the chairs are of the same design, and could date from the refitting of the room.\r\nBoth bar backs are insignificant and look to have had alterations.\r\n\r\nDespite alterations it's a delightful place with an unchanging atmosphere.",

Note the 2 sets of spirit cocks on the bar back which dispensed spirits, some of which were allegedly distilled in the attic. R = rum; BB = brown brandy; S = scotch; G = gin; IR = Irish whisky; PB = pale brandy. The vats were finally removed in the mid 1980s. CAMRA is only aware of four other sets of spirit cocks at Queens Head 'Turners Vault', Stockport, Greater Manchester; Haunch of Venison, Salisbury, Wiltshire; Bull, Paisley, Scotland; and Crown, Belfast, Northern Ireland - all CAMRA Heritage Pubs.\n\r\nAt the Drapery end is a small snug now accessed by a wide opening, but the original half doors are still there. At the Drum Lane end a wide doorway leads to what until the mid 1980s was the completely separate Barrel Bar which had a large bar counter compared to the size of the room. The bar fittings and a dumb waiter were removed when the local authority insisted that the pub added a gents WC so the old gents urinal which was opposite the new food bar was removed and a new gents built in part of the Barrel Bar. The original entrance doors are still there in Drum Lane with a barrel hanging over them. This room has a 1930s brick fireplace, old seating and other 1930s features such as 2 niches and a small roof over the corner where the bar was situated. Closed Sundays.\n\r\nAmazingly, this pub was owned by Felinfoel Brewery from 1948 to 1985 as a result of Major Lewis having a first refusal on the retirement of the Shipman Brothers. Then the Lewis family sold it to pub company J T Davies (now called Brakspear's have bought that pub company in 2007 and renamed).

The pub is now only of local interest. \r\n\r\nThe former description is shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \r\n\r\nThe servery is an unusual feature in this early 18th-century stone- built, thatched pub. Outside doors labelled \u2018Public Bar\u2019 and \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 lead to a small room, with a floor part flagstoned and part quarry-tiled, betraying the fact that two rooms were combined in the 1980s. This was supposedly to make skittle-playing safer - cheeses were formerly thrown from the narrow passage into the public bar making it necessary to stop play when anyone wanted to enter or leave the pub! The original servery/cellar is at the rear and installation of the bar counter has made the drinking area very tight. From the entrance lobby on two levels is a small lounge, formerly two tiny rooms, with a small modern counter and Raeburn cooker. The dining room occupies a modern extension.",

        "Address": "Main Street, Awsworth, NG16 2RN",
        "Description": "A three-storey building pub in Georgian-style but dating from c.1880. Originally, it is thought, the pub consisted of a bar with servery, situated where you now find the inside toilets on the right, and the small snug on the left, with a passageway between them. Then in the 1950s two former private rooms at the rear were brought into use \u2013 a bar with new servery on the rear left and a lounge on the rear right - and the pub has barely changed since. The central entrance leads into a T-shaped hall with staircase leading to a function room. This area is a popular \u2018drinking passage\u2019 with a few tables and chairs; the servery is straight ahead with a small hatch counter \u2013 the panelled front of which is of a 50s style and has a Formica top. Front-left snug is used for pool and has very old fixed benches all round, but the fireplace has been removed. Rear-left is the main bar with 1950s counter and plain bar back, fixed seating could be of similar vintage but there is no fireplace. Rear-right is a lounge with plushly upholstered benches each side and service from a door-hatch with panelling below, all of 1950s vintage; as could be the fireplace. Most walls are in 'Artex' style with applied timbers. Original doors and door surrounds throughout. The former skittle alley has been converted into a smoking area by removing one wall. \r\n\r\nUpdate April 2012. This former Hardy & Hansons pub is now a free house selling a range of real ales. A new extension is being built to house: new toilets including a disabled one: a corridor to the skittle alley: on the first floor toilets for the function room: an outside drinking/smoking area. The existing gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 toilets are to be converted back into a room (licensees say it was originally a living room) and then the pool table will be moved into the new room (it may have an arched entrance) and the present pool room on the left will become a snug. In the public bar the darts has been moved and a short partition added around it. In the lounge the 1960s timbering on the walls will be removed and a Victorian-style fireplace put back in. These seems to be sympathetic alterations leaving the previous layout intact and passageway drinking will continue.",

Left of the hall is a small square bar-parlour; some plain fixed benches here, a small (Victorian?) fireplace, and an old triangular cupboard.

The small bar-servery in the front room (this was relatively modern) has been removed, replaced by painted panelling. To give access from the front room to a counter, a wide doorway has been knocked-through between the two rooms. Although panelling has been retained in the front room, the inevitable \u2018gastro\u2019 grey-green paint has been applied. So the character of the right-hand side of the pub is ruined. Just about the only decent survival is the small snug on the left-centre.\n\nPlease note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description below is one written before the recent changes. \n\r\nThe structure of the building is old, possibly 17th C. witnessed by the thick stone walls. Major rebuilding was carried out by Home Brewery in the 1920s and 1937: this included raising the height of the building - as can be seen on the west gable wall. Superb unspoilt village pub, with its multi-roomed layout of 1937 intact and it retains a lot of 1930s features. The central front entrance to lobby leads to small rooms to the left and right. The smoke room on the right retains its 1930s panelling to picture-frame height and the fireplace has a 1930s wood surround but a 1960s stone interior. A door from the right hand side lobby was blocked up in the 1960s and new fixed seating installed. The bar counter could be from the 1960s but the bar back looks modern.\n\r\nThe left door leads to a parquet floored passage with 1930s panelled walls. A rare part-glazed partition wall separates the passage from a small snug, which retains its 1930s counter and stone & brick fireplace. The walls are covered with more 1930s panelling and the bar back is a mixture of old and new work. The small left hand lounge has been subject to much refurbishment (new dado panelling and fireplace) with only the parquet floor remaining from the 1930s. The bar counter could be 1960s work with its copper top and the bar back has a mixture of old and new work. A parquet-floored passageway leads from the rear door of the lounge to the original external door. The former off-sales was situated here with service from a hatch in the main bar area. A 'lean-to' and toilets at the rear were added in 1970 and enables you to walk all around the pub; the original outside toilets are now a coal shed.\n\r\nThe larger bar-lounge rear-right was added in 1937 and has a large inglenook brick fireplace with a decorative ceramic strip at mantelshelf level and original slotted benches. The bar counter here looks like the original 1930s one but the bar back is a mixture of old and new work. The rear single-storey Paddock Room, originally part of the stable block, was converted in the late 1960s early 1970s to become a cocktail bar and is now a popular dining/function room that can hold 50 people. Also, in the first part of the 20th century the pub brewed its own beer from the old stable block.",

It has an attractive exterior and a rare, little-altered interior. The public bar on the right has a lino-tiled floor, original bar counter and bar-back with panelling around it running from the front door to the rear wall; the counter front has \u2018leather-effect\u2019 panels and a foot rail; the curvy benches, all round, are excellent, though a strange upholstered panel has been added to the seat backs; and a 1950s brick fireplace (unused). Left hand entrance door leads to passageway with what looks like the original off sales window - now a fixed panel. The lounge, which is little used, has a fine original boarded bar counter with grooved panelling around, \u2018port-hole\u2019 style doors, but plush modern upholstery; also an original fireplace with a Regency-style surround - but the fire removed. The gents' toilet is centre-front between the bar and lounge entrance and it and the two ladies' toilets retain original fittings. The public bar acts as the headquarters for Coddington FC and holds the trophy cabinet and notice board with the club's history.",

Bare Victorian benches still line the exterior walls but the existing bar counter and bar back only date from the 1960s. In the large lobby on the right hand side with a dado of green glazed bricks the off sales hatch in a door with a figure '2' above it remains. Off the lobby a room with '1' on it is now used for storage and the kitchen has a '8' on the door. The rear bar with '3' on the door was refitted in c.1960 and contains a classic curved counter of a late 1950s style with Formica top. Note the frieze of Newark market above the counter in the \u2018pot shelf\u2019 area. Upstairs is a function room containing two early 20th century tiled and wood surround fireplaces but the bar was added in recent years.",

        "Description": "Early 19th century pub that, when extended in 1976 by Hardys & Hansons, retained untouched the original layout of four rooms, known as The Shambles, and off-sales hatch and a large new lounge was added. This is one of the finest examples of how to expand the drinking space in a pub without wrecking the original characterful part and was achieved due to the pub being Grade II listed with an interior description and the actions of Nottingham Branch of CAMRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main entrance to the pub is from the car park side but you can still use the original door in Middle Street, which leads into a quarry tiled passage. Through a pair of doors, now kept open, is a sliding hatch and intact stable door with a shelf and part glazed upper door. To the right is the public bar, now called the 'Whisky Bar', through another pair of doors in the wood and glass partition wall. This very small room has a red and black quarry tiled floor (in 2009 the lino covering the tiles was removed) and retains bar fittings which the listing description state date from c.1880. The counter has herringbone panelled front and a top of some age with a bow in the middle; the mirrored bar back with a carved wood surround has a lower section containing four small cupboards and shelves painted a dull green colour. The foot-rail rests on cast iron stands, there is an old bench and just three small tables.\r\n\r\nTo the right is another part glazed partition wall with a door and beyond it is a tiny snug measuring 8 ft x 5 ft called the 'Confessional' (so called because of its size). This area was previously the off-sales, as confirmed on the plan of 1952. The bar has another counter with herringbone panelled front and there is a small old fixed bench. The doorway from the former carriage entrance into the Snug has been closed off, and matchboard panelling applied to the walls - probably in 1976. The screen between the two rooms looks old, but may have had minor alterations such as some new glass; there is a '5' on the Snug side of the door. \r\n\r\nTo the left of the entrance passage is the small Snug with a door and on three sides the original fixed seating, which has leatherette padding added; but the former fireplace is missing. The passage continues to the last of the original rooms \u2013 now called the Games Room. It has a door, wooden floor, old dado panelling and fixed seating of different dates \u2013 part could be either pre-war or from 1976 and an early 20th century tiled fireplace with a wood surround that looks more modern. The curved bar counter could be of inter-war date and may have replaced a hatch - it is shown on the plan of 1952. The panelling in the Public bar, Confessional and dado panelling in the Passage is painted making it difficult to date so some could be modern work. \r\n\r\nThe rear brewhouse and stable (not public) survive with original stable doors, and are now used for storage.",

The entrance is into a lobby with a former tiny snug or off-sales straight ahead - this now used for storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the right is a good plain bar, self-contained with its own toilets. The main bar is on the left, and the back corner of this has been opened out into two further rooms, used mainly for dining for most of the day. Doors, windows and benches look original Victorian, but clearly there was a makeover during the 1930s, when the bar serveries were added to both main rooms - these appear to be mostly intact with some Art Deco features. Dado panelling, floors and fireplaces were also installed at the same time, and much of these survive, with minor alterations. In the rear lobby is a staircase with stained glass window. At the back is a garden alongside the railway. Entirely non-smoking, and no mobile phones - even in the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the adjacent railway station and its platform shelters are grade 2 listed.",

Modern benches on both floors in booth formation which match those on the original plans. Modern servery on the left. Original arched glazed roof, though much restored. Grade 2 listed.\r\n\r\nThe original plans by Edwin Hill are displayed in the basement.

A member of staff will respond (not on Fri and Sat evenings) so choose your drinks - real ales are listed on a chalk board near the doorway to the servery - and they will be brought to your table. Until recently, the number of pubs in the country offering table service was down to less than a dozen but the trend has recently been reversed with nearly half of the micropubs being set up in England having no bars.\n\r\nThis three-storey pub of brick built about 1850 appears to have had a quality refit in the inter-war period. The front door leads to an inner lobby with a window that was probably an off sales in the past. The lounge is little altered since about 1930 and retains carved bench seating throughout with turned legs and moulded arms, a couple of draught screens/baffles near the door to the servery, panelled frieze above the seating with wooden studs, terrazzo and wood surround fireplace, and Art Deco-style doors.\n\r\nThe public bar was two rooms in the past and has good-quality fittings such as a bar counter with double columns and capitals but they only date from a refurbishment in 1993. There is what looks like an old glazed publican's office towards the rear of the bar servery.\n\r\nNote the splendid set of etched windows with a peacock motif - no doubt some are quality replacements.",

The entrance is into a narrow flagged passage with the oldest room on the right - the \u2018King Charles Snug\u2019 has a \u20181\u2019 over the doorway, ancient beams, a 1930s brick fireplace but the (disused) brick and timber bar looks more 60s and fixed seating is not easy to date \u2013 probably more 60s than 30s. Left of the passage, the pub was extended into an adjoining brick building, probably early 19c, and here is the small bare boarded \u2018Cromwell Snug\u2019 with a \u20182\u2019 on the door, dado fielded panelling with benches attached most of the way around which looks like 1930s work, but the copper infill and wood surround fireplace looks more 1960s. The passage widens out on the left into an internal lobby area with sloping flagged floor and bench seating. One door here leads down into one of the most extensive of the many sandstone cellars or caves in central Nottingham.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the far end is the third main building, a Tudor-style hall from the 1930s, fronting Maid Marian Way. The interior is much altered here, suffering from several post-war refurbishments, the last probably in the 1970s, but the interesting timber-beamed roof structure can be examined from the first-floor gallery, which is probably a modern insertion.  If you call at quiet times and ask you may be able to take a trip down two floor levels into the cellars.",

A major remodelling took place in the 1920s-1930s, with Art Deco windows and faience added to the ground floor. The windows have some damage. The interwar d\u00e9cor has survived in the small front bar: windows, internal doors and partitions survive with leaded glass; a curved Art Deco bar counter protrudes with a step at its base; above the counter is a curved canopy with mirrored glass and coloured panels (some damage here); a column has mirrored mosaic tiles in Art Deco style; the sturdy benches appear to be original Victorian. The bar-back is modern. The main poor feature is that a former door on the corner is blocked off with a crude postwar panel and window. This maybe indicates that the bar was possibly two rooms originally. Oddly, the central heating pipes run across this former door.",

In the centre is a bar counter which looks like it was installed in the 50s (locals say it is older) but the bar back is modern. High backed fixed seating in the right room is from the mid 1950s (the seating was originally slatted) but the fireplace looks more modern. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe left room, which has a cast fireplace from the 20s, is now only accessible via the rear lounge and its doorway from the other two has been converted into a hatch. The extension is of classic inter-war brick and includes a bay window still with two 'lounge' panels. The whole room is panelled and there are some bell pushes remaining. The counter is the 1920s one with a copper top possibly added in the 50s, but the bar back is mostly modern. Opposite the large 1920s brick fireplace there originally was a separate kitchen - nearby is the original access to the servery through the centre of the counter. An extension in 1952 brought the toilets inside and a further one in the 1980s houses the new kitchen. There is a small area towards the front of the building with a small stone Tudor arch fireplace and a tiny snug on the far left was doubled in size in the 1980s - note how some original panelling was moved into the new part.",

The Public Bar on the right has a bar counter the same as the one in the lounge, 1950s fixed seating but the room has been extended in the 1990s to almost double its original size.

        "Pub Name": "Berkeley Hotel",
        "Address": "Doncaster Road, Scunthorpe, DN15 7DS",
        "Description": "The Berkeley is a large roadhouse brick built pub/hotel on a massive plot that was built in the late 1930s and opened in 1940. Very helpfully there is the press cutting about the opening in a frame in the lounge bar and states it was built by Councillor and Mrs Kennedy, the architects were Messrs Scott & Clarke of Wednesbury, West Midlands and the contractors were Messrs T H Nichols of Walsall. It states Samuel Smiths supplied (not owned) the pub. \r\n\r\nIt retains its original layout of three bars (one now primarily a dining room), a ballroom and spacious entrance lobby, also the off sales is there but used for storage and has lost its fitments. There were  changes to some fittings in the 1990s otherwise it is very much 'as built'. Upstairs there is a meeting room (formerly the lounge for guests) and eight bedrooms, which are still in use at around \u00a335 plus \u00a35 for a continental breakfast but signs warn that the rooms do not have TV\u2019s (due to Samuel Smiths policy of no music or TV\u2019s in their pubs!). \r\n\r\nThe T-shaped lobby retains its 1930s reception on the right, a display case as you enter, a gents toilet on the left with new tiles in 1930s style and alongside a tiny cubby hole marked \u2018Cloaks\u2019. To the left are double doors and surrounding screenwork which are a modern 're-creation' of how these may have looked in the 1930s. Beyond them the lounge bar retains an original counter with a trough in front designed for counter-spillages and drips, the bar back looks original but the top part may be a Sam Smiths replacement, as it is different in style from the one in the public bar. The fireplace is from the 1930s but was imported in the 1990s. The seating is of Art Deco style but likely to be of recent age (but may be the original just re-upholstered?).  The Art Deco style lighting is a modern replacement. \r\n\r\nThere is a wide staircase to the first floor and to the right is the dining room with double doors, a dado of plain interwar panelling (some may be new work) which runs across the bar counter, original bar back but the fireplace is a replacement. To the far right is the ballroom which is essentially 'as built' but the decoration has been comprehensively upgraded. This large room has a 60\u2019 by 30\u2019 maple floor, big kitchen at the front and a stage at the rear. There are lots of 1930s leaded glass windows throughout. \r\n\r\nTo get to the public bar you have to go outside and round the left hand side of the building where you will see the disused door of the off sales and almost at the rear of the building there is a door that leads into a terrazzo floored porch and lobby. The gents\u2019 off here retains its original 1930s tiled walls (new urinals), ladies possibly the same? The public bar retains its original counter, original bar back with only a minor change to insert one small fridge. There is an Art Deco stone fireplace (replacement) and the fixed seating is original.",

Also, the off sales situated at the front right of the entrance has also been obliterated.

        "Pub Name": "Queen Bess",
        "Address": "Derwent Road, Scunthorpe, DN16 2PE",
        "Description": "A largely intact estate pub built in 1957 retaining the vast majority of its original fittings. The plans are dated 1957 and there is a local tradition that the pub opened in 1957 but local press confirm it opened on 18th December 1959. The architects were Wilburn & Son of Doncaster for Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster) Ltd. It is in a plain, vernacular style (similar to another local pub, the Open Hearth) and of brick with a tiled roof. It incorporated certain notably technological advances such as underfloor heating and a central stereo sound system with loudspeakers in every room (for playing vinyl LP records).  \r\n\r\nThe name \u2018Queen Bess\u2019 echoes the title given to one of the mighty blast furnaces at the nearby Appleby-Frodingham steelworks \u2013 it was one of 2 fired up in 1939 and expanded in the 1950s. The connection is further celebrated by a plaque in the Queens Bar, by tiled motifs in the public bar fireplace and by the picture on one side of the (recently renewed) painted sign outside - the other has a portrait of Queen Elizabeth I \r\n\r\nOn the exterior there is a small display window for the off sales and four doors \u2013 the third leads to the original off sales which remains intact with a vertical panelled counter, similar styled upper section, plain bar back shelving, and original tiled floor but cannot be viewed. The left door leads to the lounge bar; right hand one to the public bar; and the second one to the landlord\u2019s accommodation.  \r\n\r\nOn the front right is the public bar which has its own entrance but the room is little used as its public bar function has been overtaken by the left hand \u2018lounge\u2019 which functions as the pub\u2019s main bar. A refurbishment of the public bar by Samuel Smiths in 2016 after being unused for 5 years appears to have made no difference! The small entrance lobby from the front has a carpet over a tiled floor and the room itself has a carpet added in 2016 over the lino tiled floor. The bar counter front is the original and tapered downwards of an unusual design with large studded decoration, both to the counterfront itself and to the timber part above the counter. \u2013 it was subject to a darker stain in 2016. Up to 2016 it had a red Formica top but this has been replaced by a wooden one. The bar canopy with more of the projecting timber truncated-pyramidal shapes here is also original and retains its two original loudspeakers.  \r\n\r\nThe mirrored bar back fitting with glass shelves is original but up to 2016 it had a red Formica main shelf (replaced by wood). There is a cupboard in the bottom right and only one fridge has replaced lower shelves in the bottom left section. The fixed seating looks 1950s as does the wood surround fireplace with a tiled interior with a pictorial motif refrencing pig iron.  \r\n\r\nUp to 2012 there was a large part glazed screen by the inner door but this was ripped out in the 2016 changes \u2013 however, it is not shown on the original plans so appears to be a later insertion by Samuel Smiths. On the walls on the servery side there were some very 1950s ribbed hardboard panelling painted yellow and a trophy cabinet near the entrance but both were removed in 2016. Up to 2016 it looked like it still retained the original tables and chairs, now gone. The toilets off this room were also modernised in 2016 with the only original fittings being the floor tiles in the ladies.  \r\n\r\nThe left hand small entrance lobby has original floor tiles but the dado tiling looks modern. This leads to the lounge bar still with its large part glazed screen by the door (which appears to be a later insertion by Samuel Smiths). On the right hand side and around the servery is a dado of varnished ply panelling. The bar counter has a lovely original quarter circle front of three horizontal strips of varnished ply panelling as on the walls. The bar canopy is also original and of a vaneer of pale wood with another loud speaker and also two ventilation grilles; the mirrored bar back with glass shelves appears intact. Also retained is the original fixed seating around the room but the wood surround and tiled fireplace is a recent replacement for a brick one (that itself was only installed in 1992).  \r\n\r\nThe only change to the layout of the pub took place in 2012 when a doorway was cut in the solid wall behind the lounge bar servery so staff can now see customers waiting for service at the counter of the Queens Bar at the rear.  \r\n\r\nOn the far left hand side of the pub there are double doors being the main entrance to the rear concert room in a single storey part of the building. They lead into a lobby with original tiled floor and through double inner doors is a wide passage leading to the Queens Bar at the rear, which was originally the concert room. Off the passage are gents and ladies toilets which are little changed with wall tiles painted over. There is a viewing window at the end of the passage for staff and original double doors lead into a large room. Nowadays it is home to a full-size snooker table and a pool table but originally this was a very popular venue for live music with a stage (that has now been removed).  \r\n\r\nThe servery is situated in a recessed low ceilinged section with fluted timber piers of distinct 1950s panelling around the approaches and a timber beam above with the wording \u2018Queens Bar\u2019. It has a 1950s bar counter front which tapers inwards and a mirrored bar back with glass shelves which presumably lost one bay to accommodate the doorway for staff from the lounge bar; only one fridge replacing some of the lower shelving. It has a lino tiled floor and fixed seating which is probably a later addition. Original doors remain throughout.",

It has an interesting interior where the layout and a lot of the original features survive. The front door leads to a wide lobby front-left with the toilets on the left where some tiling may have been replaced. Above the front door is a blacksmiths scene in deep relief which is a replacement for the original bronze one. There is no obvious sign of an off-sales but there is a door in the lobby on the public bar side. Large public bar with an interesting counter front which looks like the original as it is of a distinctive 1950s style, the bar back looks original with some fridges replacing part of lower shelves. There is what looks like some original fixed seating but the right hand side has no seating (i.e. has some been lost?) and is home to a pool table.  \n\nDoors at end of the lobby lead to a small room centre-left which has a \u2018Lounge\u2019 copper label but locals still call it \u2018The Penny Lounge\u2019 as beer cost one penny more in here than in the public bar when the pub opened. This room has interesting original panelling and counter fronts of the same design but the top part of the bar back fitting looks a replacement. The lower shelves do look like the original ones but a fridge has replaced some shelving and the fixed seating looks like the original.  \n\nThe rear room, also labelled \u2018Lounge\u2019 (where the beer was two pennies dearer than in the public bar when the pub opened) has a three-part door from the \u2018Penny Lounge\u2019. This larger room also has interesting original panelling and counter fronts of the same design, and a Tudor style stone fireplace that may have been relocated here from elsewhere? The bar back looks like a mixture of old and new with a cupboard on the right hand side and fridges have replaced some shelving. Note the unusual coat hooks all along the top of the counter front. All the rooms have modern laminate floors and with the other modernised features in the rooms preclude a recommendation as a National Inventory Pub.  \n\nThe book 'The Inns and Pubs of Nottinghamshire' (Notts County Council. 1995) states: \"The current house was built in the 1960s and is the second to bear this name.

It was been refurbished in the 1930s, the 1950s and again in 1984 and now caters for a mature clientele. Just inside the front door a part glazed full height screen on the right creates a small public bar. It has a bar where the counter has a front added in 1984 on top of the 1950s one and new bar top to replace a red Formica one. A short passage to the left leads to a small room with old dado panelling and some fielded panelling above that looks inter-war. In 1984 the inglenook fireplace was exposed but, sadly, the brick fireplace was rebuilt / re-faced. Note how the old corner wall cupboard was converted into a dart cupboard but when a pool table was introduced later the dart board was moved to its present position. The doorway to the room has detailing from the 1930's. Until 1984 the rear room was a passage to the rear and a tiny room served by a hatch i.e. the wall was removed,  the room extended back, a new bar, fixed seating and fireplace installed. The former outside toilets now have a covered walkway to them.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2018.  Following the purchase of the the pub by Castle Rock a thorough refurbishment has seen significant changes.   \r\n\r\nThe main bar is little-changed but the former Billiard Room is now half of its original size and called the Arkwright Room with toilets added behind it; billiard tables removed and the hatch that served this room is lost. The front left room is now a new bar called the Dispensary to reflect it is where the Boots shop was situated, New bar fittings added. Upstairs the managers office remains unchanged as does the ballroom but the bar here looks more modern? Downstairs the skittle alley remains but is out of use at present and the other room is used for storage. \n Please note - the photos are therefore out of date and the description below is one written before the recent changes.  \r\n\r\nA 1903 Tudor-style building by architect Alfred Nelson Bromley, formerly the Boots Social Club with, up to 1973, a retail branch of Boots at the front left ground-floor part of the building. It has most facilities that would be included in a purpose-built membership club and these have been retained following the sale by Boots in 2010 and reopening as a pub and conference centre. On the ground floor is the baronial hall-style main bar lit by a skylight with gold floral decoration and fine staircase with carved wood balusters and newel post. The servery has an old bar counter which still retains shutters for raising to open and lower to close \u2013 note the maker's name of \u2018Wat Simmonds Nottingham phone 75478\u2019 and the bar back fitting could be old. To the rear is a glazed screen with twin doors leading to the Snooker Room which has four full-sized snooker tables and raised seating around three sides. There is a hatch to the side of the bar where the counter front looks to date from c.1970 but it has another old shutter. The former shop is now the Lounge with a stage, dance floor and bar that looks to date from c.1970.  \r\n\r\nOn the first floor is the splendid Committee Room with a wood block floor; the walls have fielded panelling to picture frame height all around, an inglenook fireplace with benches either side, a glazed brick fireplace with Delft tiled interior, stained and leaded exterior windows including some with rose symbols and a large table. The fine stained glass was designed by the well-known architect Morley Horder. Note the window of the Committee Room overlooks the main bar presumably \u2018for control purposes\u2019! The ballroom has a curved ceiling, sprung dance floor in the centre of the room, lots of leaded windows with crests of kings of England along the top but the bar here looks like it dates from c.1973. In the basement there is a well used skittle alley and a bar that also looks like it was added in c.1973. There is also another room that the owners would like to convert into a Snooker Room. A modern reception has been added near the main bar.",

The pub is included here for its rare snug created by three old high-backed fixed settles one of which has an iron stay attaching it to the ceiling. It is situated on the left hand side of what is an otherwise opened-up interior with a number of areas and island servery. The main settle is substantial with two straight sides and a curved middle section. Another settle is situated on the exterior wall side reaching the fireplace and between the two settles is a window and below it old dado panelling with wall bench seating. The snug has a largish fireplace having a wooden surround and cast iron with glazed brick interior but disused. The mantle shelf almost reaches the ceiling and there are old wall cupboards to the left and right. On the left side of the fireplace is a small high-backed settle beyond which is a narrow entrance before the larger settle. The snug is a remarkable survivor and the only distracting feature is that in recent years all the historic woodwork has been painted a dull green colour. \r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of  similar rooms or snugs formed of two or more high backed settles left in the whole of the UK. They can be found at the following Heritage Pubs \u2013 the \r\nHolly Bush, Mackeney, Derbyshire; \r\nMalt Shovel, Spondon, Derbyshire; \r\nGreen Dragon, Flaunden, Hertfordshire; \r\nRed Lion, Kenninghall, Norfolk; \r\nNorth Star, Steventon, Oxfordshire; \r\nKings Head, Laxfield, Suffolk; \r\nBell & Cross, Holy Cross, Clent, Worcestershire; \r\nOld White Beare, Norwood Green, West Yorkshire; \r\n Red Lion, Llansannan, North West  Wales;; \r\n Crown, Snape, Suffolk;; \r\n Wheatsheaf, Raby, Merseyside;; \r\nand\r\nAnchor, High Offley, Staffordshire .",

The room / area at the rear has a wooden floor probably added over more terrazzo floor. All the fixed seating could be 1930s (or possibly early post war) and the wood surround of fireplaces also looks old but with modern interiors. Both ladies and gents\u2019 retain their full height original tiled walls and tiled floors but the black marble urinal looks modern. Opens at 4 Mon to Thu.",

(Possibly the exterior door in this area led to an off sales in the past?). The ornate bar back fitting has a series of columns with decorative capitals, old shelves but the tiles are modern and possibly some shelves lost to add an optic panel? A fridge has replaced some of the lower shelving. The fixed seating is old but looks to date from inter-war (or even post-war?) times.

It was then that the old back corridor was merged into the smoke room, a full-blown bar-counter created, and stillaging introduced in the servery - where beer is still served direct from a jug to this day. A back conservatory extension for hikers was also added at that time (rebuilt more permanently around 1975) and the semi-private kitchen ceased doubling-up as a pub room. The hatch to the latter is still clear to see.\r\n\r\nOther Heritage Pubs still using a jug to serve at least one real ale are the Barley Mow, Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire; Holly Bush, Makeney, Derbyshire; Star, Bath, Somerset; Anchor, High Offley, Staffordshire; Dyffryn Arms, Pontfaen, Pembrokeshire, West Wales; and the\r\nCresselly Arms, Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, West Wales.",

Lane Fox for Samuel Smith\u2019s brewery \u2013 that makes the Tankard Inn special. This has left us a little two-room interior of modest dignity that has stood the test of time as a good pub design of its period. Both rooms have matching 3-light windows with colourful leaded glass in patterns typical of their time and the public bar has its original bench seating and curving bar-counter. The lounge seating and counter are more recent, however, and this could be true of all the pub\u2019s panelling too.",

It consists of three small rooms linked by a side corridor, all with  stone-flagged floors, low ceilings and wooden seating, but its actual evolution is not entirely clear. The likelihood is that the present main bar area, next to the servery, was converted from private accommodation soon after the Second World War and that a lot of its internal fitments are possibly of no great age in themselves. Until 1983, when new cellars were created, the Greyhound was locally-famous for its behind-bar stillaging.",

Its main interest derives from a refurbishment of 1933 (Architect JGL Poulson) when it belonged to the local brewing firm of Middlebrough. Their patronage produced an interior rich in leaded glass, stylish joinery detail and Arts & Crafts features. Its inclusion as one of the top Heritage Pubs is for the front smoke room which is a splendid survival but there are other original fittings in much altered back parts of the pub done by Tetleys who bought the pub in the 1950s and gave it \u2018Tetleys Heritage Inn\u201d status in the 1980s. \r\n\r\nThe smoke room was dubbed \u2018The Vatican\u2019 (because only Roman Catholics were once invited in here) this wonderful room boasts fine wood panelling to picture frame level, original fixed seating, original bell pushes and a striking bow-windowed counter screen with three intact sash serving hatches but the lower sections kept in the upright position. The only change appears to be the painting over in cream of the original inter-war red brick interior of the wood surround fireplace (and adding of a modern fire). The front windows have two colourful leaded panels depicting shooting scenes (one is a modern replacement as is the glass in the door). \r\n\r\nThe inner porch has a terrazzo floor with the wording \u2018New Inn\u2019 and a dado of inter-war tiling.  The main bar on the right and rear (an amalgamation of the saloon bar, concert room and jug & bottle) also retains the original counter with screens up to the ceiling but it has lost most of the lower rising panels \u2013 just the rear one on the return remains. There is more original fixed seating in a series of bays with bell pushes and similar front windows with two colourful leaded panels depicting shooting scenes. The bar back was much modernised in 2004 and at the rear is a replacement Victorian-style fireplace. \r\n\r\nThere was a separate small snug at the rear but this has been amalgamated with the main bar and its fixed seating was removed when converted into a pool room. The gents\u2019 retains its three old Doulton\u2019s urinals and terrazzo floor but modern tiles. At the rear of the building former stables have been converted into a \"Nite\" Spot called \u2018Main Street\u2019.\r\n\r\nUnderwent a sympathetic refurbishment in 2016.",

The walls used to be largely plastered with outcrops of rustic stonework but much more of the stone has now been exposed - the vast quantities of beermats stuck to the walls both here and elsewhere do the decor no favours. There is also fixed seating, stone pillars and a window alcove with rough timber beams top and sides. The arched doorway to the passage has lost its solid oak door. The room on the right thankfully retains its oak door and has an original-looking wooden counter with wooden shelves behind on a mirrored bar back.

It preserves many elements of the original domestic interior, including a seventeenth century staircase, doorways, fireplaces and decorated oak panelling. Its 1930s refurbishment by the local Tadcaster Tower brewery was conceived as a prestige project with \u2018historical character\u2019 very much in mind and although there is some uncertainty about the extent of later alteration by their successors, Bass, this remains a pub interior of unquestionable distinction.  \r\n\r\nA flagstone passage runs from the front door to the rear and there is an elliptical keyed arch to stairhall. The public bar called \u2018Ingle Bar\u2019 on the rear left has a 1930s fielded bar counter but until the 1980s the counter had a return short of the exterior wall and seating area. The bar back on the right looks modern whereas the bar back fittings either side of the hatch to the Oak Room do look old (one shelf has a copper top) but the three bays (one level and two set back) look modern. This fine room (beams look unconvincing) has an old huge brick inglenook fireplace, an old settle, and lots of cast iron based tables with copper tops.  \r\n\r\nThe Oak Room on the front left is one of the finest pub rooms in York with its 17th century oak panelled walls all around with a 1930s brick and old wood surround fireplace (might be older). Service is from a hatch to the back of the servery with twin leaded glass doors, a four sectioned ceiling and antique settle. By comparison, the front right room has panelling from the late twentieth century, a wood surround and brick infill fireplace from date unknown, and another four sectioned ceiling.  \r\n\r\nGo up the incredibly uneven seventeenth century open-well staircase with its bulbous balusters, heavy moulded handrail and square newels with ball and pedestals finials and pierced pendants. On the first floor is the function room at the front with full-height panelling in moulded surrounds, painted in trompe l'oeil rectangular and oval raised panels containing figures which are almost indecipherable..

A sensitive, low-key restoration in 1999, calling on expert historical advice brokered by CAMRA, won a national conservation award and a more recent revamp in 2009 has been carried out with similar respect for the pub's Victorian past.  \r\n\r\nPart glazed partition separates the public bar on the right from a side corridor with a stand-up lobby. The public bar has a door, old / original fixed bench seating and a new wood surround and cast fireplace. There is a lovely curved old panelled bar front and the part glazed partition continues around to separate the public bar from the servery which has an old bar back fitting.  \r\n\r\nIn the passage to rear there is a good lobby bar where the passageway widens out.

The toilets retain wall tiling from the inter-war period.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a room opened-up to the passage with some old benches near a hatch to the back of the servery, new wood surround and cast iron fireplace. Doorway to rear right very small room / area with a window (was a hatch) to the back of the servery. A staircase has been removed and it now houses a bar billiard table.",

The serveries, though, have undergone some later adaptation while the snug was stripped of all its bench seating in 2005.  \r\n\r\nThe front left \u2018Oak Room\u2019 has a door with leaded glazed panel in the top, terrazzo floor, 1930s Tudor arch wood surround fireplace, original fixed seating in two sections, fielded panelling counter looks original, good bar back (old / age?), carving on top, glass fronted cabinet, till drawer under main shelf looks 1930s.  \r\n\r\nIn the parquet floor passage from the front door to rear the inner door has 1930s leaded panel and a door to servery has fixed two part window and ledge which originally served the small front right room; the old dado panelling has been painted gastro grey in recent times.  \r\n\r\nFront right small snug has a parquet floor, the fireplace is possibly the 1930s wood surround with brick interior one (modern?) and fixed seating is a 2005 replacement for the original taken out prior to requesting planning permission.  \r\n\r\nRear left small \u2018Lounge\u2019 has a parquet floor, the small curved bar counter dates from the 1950s and probably replaced a hatch, fielded panelled fireplace painted purple looks 1930s one, two sections of 1930s fixed seating \u2013 good but new / old? bar back with what looks like an old carving at the top, display cabinet on the left of the counter (age?). In the servery the gap between the bar and the lounge was until c.2010 a doorway sized one and has been much widened. There is a doorway to the conservatory-style small extension at the rear on a higher level.  \r\n\r\nOn first floor, elements of timber-frame are visible in front small function / meeting rooms.",

        "Description": "Designed in 1903 for the Tadcaster Tower brewery by local architect Samuel Needham (a leading influence on early twentieth century pub design in York) this is a small purpose-built Edwardian pub with a layout footprint of rare intactness and good original windows and tiling. Of traditional plan, it has a through hallway with two rooms either side. (CAMRA sought statutory listing in 2009, but without success). \r\n\r\nSmall front bar has a bare wood floor, 1970s bar counter front and modern bar back fitting, old bare backed fixed seating (re-covered in 2016), a reproduction wood surround and cast iron fireplace replace the previous 1950s brick fireplace in 2016. Look for the bell box with four windows over the wide hatch to the passage. \r\n\r\nSuperb tiled passage from front door has a red quarry tile laid diagonally with yellow and red tiled border and a line of black tiled near the skirting and a dado a glazed brick walls on both sides in mainly brown and some light blue. It is served by an enlarged service opening (once a modest stable-door hatch) to the side of the servery. \r\n\r\nFront left small room has a door (original replaced in 2016 due to fire regulations), bare wood floor, original Edwardian fixed seating (re-covered in 2016), with bell pushes around the room split by a modern wood surround and cast iron fireplace with modern tiles but the mirrored mantelpiece above is old. \r\n\r\nRear left small room has a door (original replaced in 2016 due to fire regulations), new wood floor with some modern tiles in the centre, original fixed seating around the room with bell pushes in the top of the seating and fielded panelling painted grey above the dado, modern tiles and old wood surround fireplace with modern tiles, one baffle by the door. \r\n\r\nAt the rear right a small room originally in use by the licensees was brought into public use and was served via a hatch to the back of the servery. Used for storage and out of use for a few years, new licensees have converted it to a modern kitchen. \r\n\r\nSadly the original outside gents with a dado of glazed brick as per the tiled passage was swept away in 2016 so a larger patio was created and new toilets added to the right.",

The entrance lobby has a dado of Victorian tiling and there is good stained and leaded glass in the inner door screen. On the front right the tap room has old fixed seating, the bar back looks to date from the inter-war period, the counter may be old with some modern panels added (?) but the fireplace is a replacement.  \r\n\r\nThe front left room with 'Bar Parlour' etched and frosted windows has no old fittings and is home to a pool table. Ahead of the front door is a carpeted lobby with a quarter circle bar that looks to date from at least the 1950s. The most intact room is the back lounge on the right with good bench seating of age, early twentieth century green tiled and wood surround fireplace, a counter front which looks to date from at least the 1950s but has lost its door. There is a good colourful 'Ladies' stained and leaded panel in the door and the rear left room has the wording 'Kitchen'.\r\n\r\nThe Travellers was briefly owned, from 1909 to 1918, by Strout\u2019s, a small Sheffield brewery: the front window engraved with their name could be unique. Strouts were founded in 1865 and were taken over by Tennants in 1918. They also owned the Commercial in Chapletown. The pub was taken on by Samuel Smith from Whitbread East Pennines Ltd. in 1982. The following year, the rear left lounge came into use as a public room, replacing a domestic kitchen. The rear left Living Room became a Catering Kitchen (plan by Samuel Smith Architects Department) . The handpumps at the Travellers were removed in March 2015.",

        "Description": "Rebuilt in 1907 for the Sheffield brewer William Stones, the Cutler\u2019s was designed (by architect James R Wigfull, also of Sheffield) to present an impressive fa\u00e7ade to a newly-widened Westgate to provide a broader highway into the town to relieve traffic congestion.  \r\n\r\nThe exterior has a \"CUTLERS' ARMS\" in raised lettering, red tile panels containing raised lettering \"Wm STONES Ltd\" and \"CUTLERS ARMS\" above ground floor windows, and carvings at top including Cannon motif and date of 1907. The parapet has \"CANNON ALES\" in raised lettering and the south gable elevation is red brick with stone and also has raised lettering of \"CUTLERS' ARMS\", \"Wm STONES Ltd\" and \"WINES & SPIRITS\".  \r\n\r\nDespite modern opening-up of the right-hand and back areas, the original planning of well-appointed rooms radiating from a central lobby is easy to appreciate and the stained glass with green foliage and yellow flowers in a Art Nouveau style is something quite special \u2013 as is the little-altered front bar with its original back-fitting, curved counter, and elegant full-height dividing screen.  \r\n\r\nFaced with the threat of demolition as part of a major redevelopment, the Cutler\u2019s was statutorily listed in 2004. Periods of decline, then closure, followed before the local Chantry brewery carried out a splendid restoration including a stained glass window and etched glass windows damaged after the pub closed have been replaced to their original specification. The pub re-opened in early 2014.  \r\n\r\nThe shallow entrance lobby has a \u2018Cutlers Arms\u2019 mosaic floor and floor to ceiling green Art Nouveau tiles. The original inner doors have the figure \u20182\u2019 above \u2013 a requirement of the licensing magistrates - and a stained glass \u2018Cutlers Arms\u2019 overlight.  \r\n\r\nThe lobby bar has a terrazzo floor and a tiled dado of green Art Nouveau tiles. It retains the original bar panelled counter and above it a leaded screen which includes a \u2018Chantry Brewery\u2019 panel from the careful restoration of 2014. It is highly likely that there were originally sliding sash screens between the counter and the screen above.  \r\n\r\nOn the left a door leads into the snug with a parquet floor following the lifting of the carpet in 2014. This also revealed a \u2018Cannon Brewery\u2019 mosaic floor on the front left of the room indicating that there was an entrance and lobby here originally but now there is a window with \u2018Wm Stones\u2019 leaded panel so this is either modern or moved from elsewhere? This small room retains the original quarter-circle wooden bar and original bar back fitting of mirrored panels but the tiles below are modern. All around the right hand side of the servery is a screen with coloured leaded panels at the top. The room has an Art Nouveau front window with a \u2018Cannon Ales\u2019 central panel in white on red which has been restored to a high standard. The fixed seating is modern and the bucket-style fireplace was added in 2013 having come from a private house.  \r\n\r\nThe front right former \u2018smoke room\u2019 has a doorway and the top part of the wall has been removed \u2018for supervision\u2019. The lino floor was taken up in 2013 to reveal the original parquet floor, the fireplace is a reproduction Victorian one,  and the fixed seating is modern. The exterior window is a colourful Art Nouveaux one with \u2018Wines & Spirits\u2019 central panel in white on red.  \r\n\r\nThe terrazzo floor of the lobby bar indicates that the rear left hand \u2018concert room\u2019 has been opened-up in modern times and has a parquet floor revealed in 2013 by removing a lino floor. The bar counter looks like another original one but the listed description states it is modern matching in style the original bars and that this room was originally served by a hatch.  \r\n\r\nA terrazzo passage to right has green tiled walls up to dado rail, and on the right a half-glazed door and side screen with stained glass overlight, leading to upper floors. There is a terrazzo floor in the ladies\u2019 and at the end of the passage the wall has terrazzo and the gents\u2019 terrazzo floor but modern wall tiles.",

In Spring 2019, the pub was acquired by Rotherham-based, Chantry Brewery as their first Sheffield pub. Sympathetic renovation occurred, the pub reopening with a name change from the Cross Keys to the Chantry Inn later in the year.\n\nThe back parts are the main interest, with the snug a particular delight. Front door leads to a passage \u2013 to the right the public bar \u2013 to the left the lounge \u2013 it still retains the old off sales (1930s) with its two door hatch. The building was originally a mid-C13th. house for chaplains and then a schoolroom.\n\nThe snug is a little room, refitted probably in the 1920s and largely untouched since, has all its inter-war fixed seating, fielded panelling and good Art Deco wooden fire surround with an old stone interior and it is served by a hatch / doorway for staff to the servery. There is more old seating in the other rooms and a (disused) corridor hatch near the entrance. The servery and bar-fittings are all modern. \n\nIn the left lounge the fixed seating looks old and there are bell pushes but there are new bar fittings with part of a glazed partition placed on the left bar counter. The right hand public bar has new bar fittings and fixed seating. There is a wide gap to a small alcove on the far right with a good but modern tiled and wood surround fireplace. \n\nThe Chantry Inn is one of only four pubs in the UK that are claimants as built on consecrated land. It is an old vernacular building that stands virtually within the churchyard. There is a cemetery on the grounds of the pub.\n\nThe other three UK pubs are: The Mug House, Claines, Worcestershire , the Ring O' Bells, Kendal, Cumbria  (both real heritage pubs) and The Savile Arms, 12 Church Lane, Thornhill, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire WF12 0JZ.",

It preserves the essentials of its original layout of a central through-hallway and three small rooms off and the walls of the hallway and some in the public bar have a splendid colourful dado of Victorian tiles. \n\nThe inner twin doors have \u2018The Grapes\u2019 stained and leaded panels and the inner lobby has doors to the left and right. The right one leads to the corridor where the two exterior windows have \u2018Grapes Inn\u2019 etched and frosted glass.

The corridor retains its terrazzo floor, which is now covered by a carpet. The bar counter in the corridor has an old (possibly 1930s?) counter front curved at the ends with carved panels all along it and a brass strip along the top. \n\nThe front right smoke room retains its door with a modern (Tetleys) stained and leaded panel, good but reproduction of a Victorian tiled,cast iron and wood surround fireplace with an oval mirror in the mantelpiece.

Tetleys added three small stained and leaded windows in the wall between the room and the corridor \u2018for supervision\u2019 \u2013 the style closely matches original stained and leaded windows in the pub but have an orange colour whereas the original ones are of plain clear glass and light yellow colour. \n\nThe rear right room still retains its door with a modern (Tetleys) stained and leaded panel, there is a good quality fireplace but it was taken from a house some 40 years ago and installed here in 2010. There is modern fixed seating around the room and another set of three small stained and leaded windows in the wall between this room and the corridor \u2018for supervision\u2019. \n\nThe front left public bar has another dado of colourful tiles on the front wall and to the left of the fireplace \u2013 these tiles were exposed in 2010 having been covered by boards for many years and are in excellent condition. The curved left hand half of the bar counter is old (possibly 1930s) with similar carved panels to those on the counter in the corridor and also a brass strip along the top; the right hand section of the bar counter is modern with plain panels and may date to only c.2000 \u2013 in recent times there was a plasterboard partition in this area to which optics were affixed i.e. used as a bar back for the corridor servery. There is a modest bar back fitting on the rear wall being shelves on a mirrored back which may also be dating back to inter-war times (or maybe post-war). Rear exterior window has old stained and leaded glass; two front exterior windows have \u2018Grapes Inn\u2019 etched and frosted glass. The fireplace here was added in 2010. \n\nDecember 1905 plans show considerable changes in the ground floor layout of what was then a multi-roomed pub with adjacent shop (Architect: Hall & Fenton for Messes T.Rawson & Co.Ltd.)13. At that time, the current left-hand public bar was a shop and the pub had five public rooms. The pub took over the shop, the bar was installed, and the ground floor was reconfigured to provide the current layout of three public rooms.\n\nThere were further alterations in 1988 when the ground floor tenant lounge and kitchen became inside toilets. Previously, the Gents' urinal was in the rear terrace with the Ladies' on the ground floor, in the current position of the lobby entrance to the Gents'. At the same time, the bar was slightly reconfigured and the left-hand smoke room slightly extended, between them encompassing a larder (Architect: Shepherd, Fowler & Robinson for Joshua Tetley).\n\nOn 13th.June 2003, the Grapes hosted the first ever gig by the Arctic Monkeys. They delivered a 25 minute set which included, the sole performance ever of the bootlegged, \u2018Curtains Closed\u2019. This upstairs function room is now part of the licensees accommodation.",

        "Pub Name": "Sheffield Tap",
        "Address": "Platform 1b, Sheffield Station, Sheaf Street, Sheffield: Central, City Centre, S1 2BP",
        "Description": "The old First Class Refreshment Room was originally built by the Midland Railway (company architect, Charles Trubshaw) as part of their 1905 station extension and adorned inside with Minton tiled walls and fine ornamented bar fittings. The rooms became disused in the 1960s, becoming a waiting room in the 1970s before closure in 1975. \n\nThe original mahogany bar top was removed and the ornate fireplace and features taken from the building. It was locked-up in 1976. The listed interior was left to decay until 2008 when restoration began. Sheffield Station and the attached bridges were grade II listed in 1975, the most recent amendment was in 2014. \n\nThe Tap re-opened in 2009 following a comprehensive overhaul in which the tiling, terrazzo floor, parts of the bar-fittings and other joinery were beautifully restored, while items beyond repair were carefully replaced or replicated, including the entire coved and sky-lighted ceiling. Certain layout changes were made including some minor re-configuring of the bar counter and annexation of a former taxi office to give street access, while further rooms have been added later. The toilets were created from pre-existing station toilets located in the street-side half of the building.\n\nThe only significant layout changes made to the old Refreshment Room have been some shortening and re-aligning of  the bar-counter and the creation of a doorway opening through the west wall to give access to the new 'Snug Room' and the street beyond. The bar-counter would once have extended right up to the north end wall (enclosing the 'outside' door/hatch within the service area) but it now stops short by around 3 metres, with a return to the back-fitting. The back-fitting itself still projects fully up to the north end wall.\n\nThe wall tiling has been repaired/made good where necessary but is essentially original. The terrazzo flooring is also original and has been extensively restored. The ceiling, however, was badly water-damaged and had to be completely replaced. It has been  exactly reproduced by handmade technique to match the original as closely as possible (by a local firm who took detailed profiles and castings of the original mouldings). For the decorating generally, expert advice has been obtained for paint colours etc.\n\nThe building is single-storey and was flat-roofed over (for basic weatherproofing) in an earlier station refurbishment \u2013 with the result that the top panels in the ceiling's 'domes' no longer function as glazed skylights and now have an opaque green finish.\n\nThe upper part of the bar back-fitting, with its central clock feature, is original and has been sensitively re-polished. The clock itself had gone missing but has been replaced with as faithful a modern replica as possible. At some time after 1975 the entire bar-counter had been dismantled to provide more storage space and the counter-front pushed back to below the back-fitting and holes cut-out for heating radiators. The counter-front is in fact the only part of the original counter to survive and it has been very carefully restored (by West Yorkshire company, Andy Thornton) moved back to its original position, and mounted on new traditional timber framing with a new wooden counter-top.\n\nThe original fireplace had been bricked-over beyond repair and the present hearth, fireplace (a salvaged version), fire-surround and over mantel, together with the modern mirror above were newly-supplied. Original door and window joinery is retained, but with modern glazed panels.\n\nHowever, it is the addition, in 2013, of the former First Class Dining Room that has taken the entire project to a whole new level. The tiled and mirrored interior of this fine room (left largely to rot since 1976) has been splendidly restored and an on-site brewery and viewing gallery skilfully integrated. This large room with a terrazzo floor has an L-shaped plan with the trackside area having new bar fittings (there were none in the past) and display cabinets of bottled beers of the world, and the smaller street side area now occupied by a microbrewery. The Tapped Brew Co. began brewing on-site in January 2013, utilising a 4 BBL kit. \n\nConsiderable effort has been put into the beer range, so not only is the Tap an attraction to train passengers and those with an interest in historical buildings, but also to serious beer lovers. In addition to the eleven handpumps, there is a very extensive range of internationally sourced bottled beers. \n\nIn 2010, the Tap won the National Publican Food and Drinks Award Cask Pub of the Year, the Modern Railways Restoration Award and a CAMRA/Heritage England Pub Design Award (Best Conversion to Pub Use). The Sheffield Tap has been lovingly restored and as one of the UK\u2019s last surviving historic railway buffets, is a must-see. The Tap became an Asset of Community Value in June 2016. Soon after, the owners of the building, Network Rail requested a review. This was subsequently rejected by Sheffield City Council. \n\nOther historic buffet bars include: \n\u2022 Bridlington Station Buffet, Station Approach, Quay Road, Bridlington, YO15 3EP\n\u2022 Centurion, Central Station, Neville Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 5DG\n\u2022 Stalybridge Station Buffet, Railway Station, Station, Rassbottom Street, Stalybridge, SK15 1RF",

        "Pub Name": "Manor Castle",
        "Address": "Manor Lane, Sheffield, Manor Park, S2 1UJ",
        "Description": "The Manor Castle came into the hands of the Burton brewers Ind Coope following their 1914 takeover of the local Hooson\u2019s brewery. It was given a major refit in 1936, of which the two delightful small \u2018lounges\u2019 are notable remnants. Both preserve their wood panelling, fixed seating and bell-pushes. The front lounge has an attractive curved bar-counter while service to the back lounge is via a glazed \u2018stable door\u2019. Apart from two surviving Thirties fireplaces, the large main bar is wholly modernised.\n                                                                                                                                                                                         \nThe 1936 plans (architects: Holmes Son and Archer (Sheffield) for Ind Coope and Allsopp Ltd.) show a previous four-room layout with a small 'serving bar' in the rear right Snug. This is replaced by the current configuration of a central 'Service Bar' which then serves four rooms: a public bar on the right, off-sales at the front and, to the left a lounge with a smoke room at the rear of the building. \n\n1981 brought an expansion of the ladies toilets at the rear right of the building and the creation of a lobby leading from the tap room to the rear smoke room (Shepherd Fowler and Robinson for Joshua Tetley and Sons Ltd.). 1992 saw the loss of the off-sales to an extension of the Public Bar (Malt Kiln Galleries for Joshua Tetley and Son Ltd.). 2003 (Fusion by Design, Leeds for Pinch Pub Co) saw the installation of a disabled toilet at the rear left of the building.",

Acquired by Tetley\u2019s in 1954, from Gilmour\u2019s, it is interesting for the substantial survival of (now quite rare) fittings from a 1960's makeover. Both public rooms have bright, plainish serveries with sloped counter-fronts panelled with leatherette to match the seating. The public bar (once two rooms) has intact fitted seating and an above-bar lighting canopy, typical of its time. The lounge extension occurred in 1978 (D.K.Davy, Area Architect, Joshua Tetley & Son.Ltd), at which point the barrel drop was moved from the right side of the building to the front. There is an old off-sales window in the entrance lobby. \n\nIn 2019, the gable end recently received an image of a steam locomotive.",

        "Pub Name": "White Lion",
        "Address": "615 London Road, Sheffield, Heeley, S2 4HT",
        "Description": "The White Lion is a real mixture of the old and the new (not always easy to tell apart, thanks to Tetley\u2019s respectful refurbishment work). It is chiefly interesting, though, for what survives of early C20th. remodelling by the Sheffield brewers Duncan Gilmour & Co, who acquired it in 1900 when they purchased the Lady\u2019s Bridge Brewery and 15 of their tied houses.\n\nA richly-tiled central corridor, with its original service-opening, leads between the old front bar and smoke room and past two (part-altered) glazed snugs, to a large modernised former billiards room at the rear. The pub's historic merits earned it recognition, in 1989, as one of Tetley's select-group of Heritage Inns \u2013 the plaque is situated on the front left of the building. The pub advertises itself as Est 1781 when it stood some distance back from the road. Between 1877 and 1884 the front was brought forward to the road.\n\nPlans from 1902 (Edmund Winder, Architect & Surveyor, Sheffield for Messr's.Duncan Gilmour Ltd.)  show the existence of a small tap room, a third room on the right side of the corridor. Beyond this room is a kitchen and pantry. 1902 sees these two rooms becoming a billiards room. The following year sees the abolition of this tap room (E.Winder for Messr's.Duncan Gilmour Ltd.). 1908 saw the creation of the current bar area and the associated standing area in front of the bar (Edmd.Winder, Architect). In addition, the current entrance vestibule was created.\n\nThe pub is of red brick with side pilasters terminating in consoles each incorporating a lion's head. It was remodelled externally in the 1920\u2019s and has a green glazed brick dado. Two large front windows contain colourful stained and leaded panels \u2013 note on the right hand side, the \u2018N\u2019 in Windsor Ales is the wrong way round.\n\nAll along the passage is a dado of mainly cream and blue-green Art Nouveau tiles and the existence of shelves confirm this is still a popular place to drink. On the front left side is a leaded glazed screen/partition with a hatch counter. Front left latch door has a frosted panel with etched wording Gilmour\u2019s Windsor Ales & Stouts around a picture of Windsor Castle with Bar below leading to the public bar. Note the figure 1 (a requirement of licensing magistrates) is not situated at the top of the door but just above the latch. The tiny room retains its original bar counter. Note the cupboard in the counter front: there are a lot of these seen in London pubs but are virtually unheard of elsewhere in the country. The bar back fitting is modern as is the fixed seating.\n\nOn the front right a door with Duncan Gilmour & Co\u2019s Windsor Ales & Stouts and Private Smoke Room frosted and etched panel and three door protectors leads into a small room. The smoke room retains the 1920\u2019s fixed seating all around the room, a baffle by the door, and has a Victorian-style tiled, cast and wood surround fireplace.\n\nOn the second right is a door to a tiny snug with modern fixed seating and plain glass windows in the top, side and back for supervision. A number of original frosted and etched panels taken out by Tetleys in 1926 (Edmund Winder & Co. For Messrs Duncan Gilmour & Co.Ltd.) were found in the cellar and have been refitted in fresh positions throughout the rear part of the pub. Opposite the snug note the door to the servery has the wording Bagatelle Room.\n\n1929 (Wm.C.Fenton for Messr's.Duncan Gilmour & Co.Ltd.) shows the installation of a bar at the front of the large rear room, now designated as a Lounge. This lounge has four areas. 1979 saw a reconfiguration of the toilets, the gents coming in from out of the cold (Shepherd Fowler & Robinson for Joshua Tetley & Sons Ltd.) as corridor space to the left of the concert room was utilised. The most recent changes (1994) saw the opening out of the rear left games room, the installation of a modern bar and the loss of the rear right bar (Phoenix Architecture & Interiors Ltd.).\n\nThe key changes since the 1920\u2019s are:\n1. the Bagatelle room on rear left is now a modern bar.\n2. expansion at rear forms a large opened-up area.\n3. some changes to rear snugs \u2013 the far one is opened-up, glass replaced walls 'for supervision' and some seating is modern.\n\nThe White Lion illustrates the development from an C18th.beerhouse to a pub-cum-hotel in the early C20th. It retains much of its 1920\u2019s planning and fittings. The pub became an Asset of Community Value (ACV) in December 2016.",

        "Description": "Old stone built village inn still with three rooms all with separate shallow exterior porches. It is chiefly noteworthy for its unusual 1950s \u2018Barrel Room\u2019, from the time it belonged to the Wath brewers Whitworth, Son & Nephew. This very impressive little room (altered only by a 1980s cut-through to the tap room at the rear) has a concave-fronted oak counter, a 1950s brick fireplace, and ull-height ply-panelled walls. The fixed seating has 1950s style oak backing, baffles and more panelling at the base. There are six barrel tables with a lower \u2018shelf\u2019 like a dominoe table, two cushioned seats with low backs, and six barrel stools i.e. all the loose furniture in the room is made from casks. The bar back shelving is tucked away to the right of the servery and also looks to be from the 1950s. All this is said this is the work of George Milburn, tenant-licensee from 1953 to 1958, who also worked as a blacksmith at nearby Harworth Colliery. \r\n\r\nAt the rear the tap room has a bar counter that also looks a 1950s one and there are bar back shelving shared with the barrel bar. The room has been extended to the rear with some 1950s fixed seating, there is a modern fireplace at the rear but the ply panelling looks modern. \r\n\r\nThe front room, which has a separate entrance, is L-shaped with the carpeted larger part at the front with a 1950s bar counter front, a distinct 1950s bar back fitting, azed wood beams and more 1950s fixed seating. Sadly, the left hand wall has recently been stripped of some 1950s panelling and a c.1960 stone fireplace and replaced with a plain wall and modern fireplace. The smaller rear part of the room has a flagstone floor and another 1950s bar counter front. The doors to the ladies and gents toilets are also 1950s.",

        "Description": "Revamped in 1935 by the Melbourne Brewery of Leeds (architects Pennington, Hustler & Taylor of Pontefract). It is worth a visit to see a fair amount of Art Deco survivals including (possibly unique?) glazed door panels. It has two small rooms, the Tap Room from the 1930s refit and Tudor Room, a 1950s addition (from private accommodation), but the large main bar of today is as a result of the opening-up two public rooms, plus a drinking lobby.  In the entrance lobby there is a colourful floor mosaic depicting a goose with the words \u2018Gaping Goose\u2019 and the walls have 1930s tiles on them.  \r\n\r\nMost of the doors are dated from the 1930s and have unusual frosted glass panels in them (oblong with wide diagonal corners) with a central strip having the room name in red lettering on a silver background. The two 1930s inner doors have \u2018Gaping Goose\u2019 panels. They lead to the opened-up main bar with a modern bar counter and bar back, some of the fixed seating could be old, there is a reproduction Victorian tiled fireplace, and a modern baffle.  \r\n\r\nOn the front right is a room with a 1930s door that has a \u2018Tap Room\u2019 glazed panel but has lost its number. The small room has a modern tiled and wood floor, the fixed seating around the front of the room is from the 1930s but a small piece of fixed seating at the rear is modern. There are two baffles by the door with tiny \u2018Melbourne Ales\u2019 windows in the top of them. however, it has lost its fireplace.  \r\n\r\nAt the rear right is the \u2018Tudor Room\u2019 which has a 1930\u2019s door (presumably original labeled \u2018Private\u2019 but amended to \u2018Tudor Room\u2019 in the 1950s) and also a figure \u20182\u2019 at the top being a requirement of the licensing magistrates. The fixed seating looks like 1950s original and there is a good colourful leaded exterior window, but the room has lost its fireplace.  \r\n\r\nAnother 1930s door to the left of the Tudor Room has a \u2018Private Downstairs\u2019 glazed panel and a figure \u20186\u2019 at the top. Left of this is a 1930s door with a \u2018Car Park & Ladies\u2019 glazed panel which leads to a passage to the toilers - the door to the gents is another 1930s door with the wording \u2018Gentlemen\u2019 (Ladies has a modern door). Note also the very Art Deco three strips of wood added to the lower parts of walls and on doors around the right hand part of the pub.",

        "Description": "Dashingly \u2018Moderne\u2019 (Art Deco) on the outside, and the only example of this rare building type in our listings for Yorkshire, the New Inn is a design of 1934 by Leeds architect H Lane Fox for present owners, Samuel Smith\u2019s. Having opened-up the pub in the 1960s and 70s, they have in recent years made changes so that it now has a floor plan much closer to the original \u2013 which is helpfully displayed on the wall of the lounge. There are some true remains of the Thirties interior in the intact left hand gents\u2019 toilets and most of the doors and surrounds to the entrance area.  \r\n\r\nThe main front entrance leads through a vestibule into a lobby bar area with a parquet floor that looks to be Samuel Smiths work from 1993 rather than an original 1930s one. Other 1993 fittings include the counter front and bar back. On the front left the snug has a widish doorway, the Art Deco shaped wood surround fireplace with a tiled interior and the fixed seating are 1993 replacements. In the rear left lounge the Art Deco shaped wood surround fireplace with a tiled interior; good Art Deco style mirror above also date from 1993; the fixed seating must also date from 1993 as the plan shows there was none in this room.  \r\n\r\nFrom a door on the right a passage with the ladies off it leads to the tap room which saw significant change in c.2010 reducing it in size to create a kitchen at the rear right. The reason for doing this was that the kitchen situated in the former Off Sales on the right of the main entrance was too small, and what we see now is virtually back to the original plan of a small tap room and good-sized kitchen at the rear. The new bar counter is very 1930s in style and there is a \u2018Moderne\u2019 style bar back fitting and Art Deco mirror (but the original servery was very differently configured - in a corner arrangement). The small cast iron fireplace is another recent Samuel Smiths addition as is the fixed seating.  \r\n\r\nOff to the left of the lobby bar the gents is the original 1930s one with three large urinals, original mainly white tiles on the walls to picture-frame height and tiled floor. All other toilets have been modernised.",

The layout consists of a central corridor with two partly opened-up rooms plus a bar-lounge and an excellent, cosy snug. (The games room is very recent). Tetley's gave the Big Six their 'Heritage' badging in the mid-1980s and the refurbishment work from around that time bears their distinctive signature.\n\r\nThe front door is on Thomas Street West and back door on an unmade road \u2013 Horsfall Street. It was erected in 1857 as a purpose-built beer house with its own brewhouse and called the Bowling Green Inn. It was always referred to by locals as 'the Big Six' after the Big Six mineral water and hop ale works company that was run by licensees Horsfall Brothers on this site at the turn of the century. It was renamed in 1982 by Tetleys when it become an Heritage Inn.\n\r\nFrom Thomas Side West side the front door leads into an inner porch with part glazed floor to ceiling partition containing the inner door, and terrazzo floor.\n\r\nA passage with a ceiling rose leads to the small lobby bar ahead with fittings from 1928. There is a fine bar back-fitting with mirrored panels and slender pillars; old counter with modern panelled front added; old looking top, old fixed seating at rear; good inter-war looking leaded windows; and good wood surround with modern tiles fireplace.

The main change in the 1950s was to remove the centrally placed off sales so the rooms either side of it (note three doors originally in the vestibule) were combined into the large space we now see. However, there have been few changes since and the pub was sensitively restored in 2009 by the current owners that won it the English Heritage Conservation Award in the 2010 CAMRA Pub Design Awards. The front door leads into an inter-war full height glazed screened vestibule with a colourful Art Deco style terrazzo floor. The interior consists of the large central bar with small rooms to the left and right.  \r\n\r\nThe bar retains its parquet floor which was covered by a carpet until being uncovered in 2009. Most of the floor has been restored but the part near the bar counter was beyond repair so it has been replaced with modern tiles. The curved bar counter looks like it dates from the 1950s but a new oak top has been added over the original Formica one. The wooden bar back fitting has a sweeping canopy, fluted pilasters, mosaic mirror panels and glass shelving \u2013 all in classic Fifties mode. In 2009 there was some restoration and small alterations such as the loss of lower shelving for a bottle fridge. The fixed banquette seating in bays installed in the 1950s (note how it goes around the outside of the vestibule entrance blocking off the middle off sales and right hand doors that were in use until 1950). There is a tall baffle on the right hand side of the door and a lower one on the left end of the fixed seating. The fireplace which housed a 1960s gas miser now has a modern log burner.  \r\n\r\nThe small left hand snug has a tiled floor, retains its original fixed seating with bell pushes all around the room and the original wood surround fireplace with a modern tiled interior and has two 19th century oblong rustic tables that were found in the cellar and restored. The right hand room has a vinyl tiled floor, a 2009 replacement for the original mammalian flooring, retains original fixed seating with bell pushes all around the room, but the fireplace which housed a 1960s gas miser now has a modern log burner.  \r\n\r\nA \u2018don\u2019t miss\u2019 is the unchanged gents' toilets with a terrazzo floor, original urinals, inter-war tiling to two-thirds height on the walls with spaced out all around the urinal and WC areas are pairs of tiles depicting various sports such as game shooting, horse racing, soccer, angling and yachting (twice).",

A passage with fielded panelling to two-thirds height has a staircase with panelling leading to a function room. The passage finishes in lobby bar area - both passage and lobby bar have modern wood floors. The servery has a curved bar counter with a fielded panelled front, a good but modern pot shelf and modern bar back fitting. To the left is a small area with new tiled floor, an inter-war fireplace of brick and stone with carved wood in relief mantlepiece, fielded panelling to two-thirds height, and some fixed seating with a glazed baffle on the left.  \r\n\r\nThe room on the left of the passage now the dining room has glazed baffles on the left and right, inter-war fixed seating with that on the right being in two bays, bell pushes on the left side, an inter-war wood surround and brick fireplace with a mantlepiece of wood containing a row of shields. A glazed screen on top of the seating where the two bays meet was removed in 2015. On the right hand side of the passage is the tap room, a small room still with its inter-war door and leaded top light, new wood floor, an inter-war brick fireplace and around the room are bell pushes but the fixed seating that lined the walls was ripped out in 2015. To the rear right an opened-up area with more fielded panelling to two-thirds height and some fixed seating. Passage to the ladies on the far right has more fielded panelling to two-thirds height.",

        "Description": "Attractive creeper covered stone village pub belonging to the Ledston Estate. For 180 years and until only recently the pub was closed every Sunday \u2013 the pub states this was at the insistence of the Lady of the Manor due to a drunken incident so the building was ordered to be closed to adhere to the holy day of rest. \r\n\r\nIts interior conveys a sense of age-old rambling character but much of it derives from a comprehensive refit of 1962, partly done in the heavy-timber-and-exposed-stone idiom (which became quite fashionable for rural \u2018destination\u2019 pubs) of which this is a good early example. From 1962 further rooms (to the original pre-war two) have been added with admirable concern for keeping the pub\u2019s essential compartmented character. The old pub entrance was blocked-up in 1962 and you now enter from the car park side. \r\n\r\nThe highlight is the splendid small room on the corner of the building \u2013 it is separated from the tiny area in front of the servery by two settles. One is three-quarters height with an iron stay holding it to the ceiling and on the low doorway side of it is the figure \u20181\u2019; the other is curved side and of half height. The seating is old with panelled backs and upholstered seat situated on stone plinths. There is a stone fireplace with a wooden overmantle and log fire; also a beam and plank ceiling. \r\n\r\nThe island servery was added in 1962 and consists of stone counters with wooden tops facing two directions and a central stillage of shelving. The other original pub room is the small one on the opposite side of the servery with a narrow door having the figure \u20182\u2019 on it. It has old dado panelling; some more of the fixed seating of the upholstered style on stone plinths; a stone fireplace reaching the ceiling with a log fire; and here the counter is curved. \r\n\r\nFrom this room go up two steps to another small room with double doors; carpet; dado panelling looks 1960s; two pieces of fixed seating on stone bases; and a 1950/60s brick fireplace with a modern stove in it. \r\n\r\nToby Room is another small one off the settle room with upholstered fixed seating on stone bases all around; a stone fireplace reaching the ceiling with large timber uprights holding up the top section and a log burner; and a baffle by the door. \r\n\r\nOn the first floor is the Hastings Room restaurant accessed via a stone staircase from the flagstone passage which leads to toilets.",

The room is simply appointed and the counter has had the same panelling applied as appears on the adjacent area of wall once occupied by a fireplace. In the right-hand lounge, the attractive bar counter, with stained glass above, is from the 1950s.

The ground floor exterior including mullion windows was treated to a glazed green and buff stone and on the fascia in stone relief is the wording \u2018Templar Hotel\u2019, \u2018Lounge\u2019, \u2018Melbourne Ales\u2019, \u2018Vault\u2019, Templar Hotel\u2019 on the Templar Street side, and \u2018Saloon\u2019 and \u2018Templar Hotel\u2019 on Vicar Lane side. Although the division between the front Saloon and the Vault has been lost, much of the quality refitting including some \u2018Tudor\u2019 elements remains, which is quite remarkable for a city centre pub. The significant changes were in 1985 when the present toilets were created, albeit in approximately the same position as the 1927 ones.  \r\n\r\nThe left hand door on Templar Street with \u2018Lounge\u2019 above it leads to a porch with a dado of inter-war tiling in mainly cream. The entrance to the rear lounge is now an arch but this room is otherwise little changed with panelling to two-thirds height all around the room, a good inter-war wood surround fireplace (but modern Tetleys tiled interior), original fixed seating with bell pushes above, a plain baffle and a door to private room with a colourful panel in the top.  \r\n\r\nThe front left door with \u2018Saloon\u2019 above it leads to a lobby with inter-war panelling to two-thirds height. It leads to a long narrow interior having lost a partition originally separating the saloon at the front from the vaults in the middle; also a door near the toilets that created a large hall in front of the lounge has also been removed. There is panelling on the walls to two-thirds height, some original fixed seating but some new seating in front of the blocked up vaults door. The original bar counter with an unusual panelled front survives as does the bar back fitting with Tudor arch bays on the left and right side; even a good portion of the lower shelving survives (some lost to fridges). The screen on the counter around the glass washing area in 1980s Tetley\u2019s work.  \r\n\r\nThe toilets were revamped in 1985 but the 1927 doors look to have survived. The Templar still uses Autovacs to serve the real ales.  \r\n\r\nThe Templar is under threat having been recently compulsorily purchased by Leeds City Council as part of the proposed  Eastgate / Harewood Street shopping development and will be sold onto developers Hammerson PLC, who have stated \u201cThe Templar Hotel will be refurbished as part of the scheme. The facade will be restored.\u201d An ACV has been registered with Leeds City Council.",

        "Pub Name": "Friendship Hotel",
        "Address": "536 Manchester Road, Sheffield, Stocksbridge, S36 2DW",
        "Description": "The Friendship was rebuilt by Thomas (Tom) Edward Batty, in 1903 and advertised as, \u2018Re-built, Re-furbished and up-to-date.\u2019 The building was built to serve the growing town of Stocksbridge with miles of steelworks and thousands of workers. Peak employment was 6500. There is imposing stonework above the central doorway, \u20181903\u2019 and the initials \u2018TEB\u2019 can be clearly seen. This also includes \u2018a handshake:\u2019 This symbol is that of the Stocksbridge Band of Hope Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd. founded in 1860. Tom Batty was a bottler of beers (including \u2018Bass and Worthingtons\u2019 fine ales\u2019). The pub has an example of one. \n\nThe Friendship retains a significant part of its original fittings and fixtures in 3 of its original 4 rooms and a lobby bar as well as plenty of tiling. It was sold by Enterprise Inns, taken on, redecorated and reopened, with Bradfield real ales, in December 2014. The new owners have carried out a sensitive refurbishment preserving and enhancing the historic interior. \n\nThe inner lobby has floor to ceiling tiling in shades of green. Walk into a lobby bar area still with the original panelled counter with pillasters and superstructure above (top section painted grey) that would have originally contained shutters / screens. The bar back fitting looks to be the original with similar pilasters to those on the counter front but the top does have some modern work such as new top shelving and the lower shelves have been replaced by fridges. Tom Batty was a bottler of beers (including \u2018Bass and Worthingtons\u2019 fine ales\u2019) and the pub has an example of one. \n\nThe room on the front left (originally, the Tap Room, currently, the Pool Room) has a door, original fixed bench seating around most of the room. In the early 1970\u2019s, the door to this room was moved from the wall perpendicular to the entrance to the current position which is why the fixed seating is missing from the right hand wall and the front window section stops short of where the original door was. There is a row of bell pushes all around the room in a wood panel above the seating but the cast iron fireplace is modern. The most impressive feature of this room is the tiled frieze around three sides of the room (not on the front wall side) and on the rear wall there are five tiled panels of plain cream tiles with a green glazed edging. In the 1960\u2019s, the Tap Room was known locally as the \u2018gambling casino,\u2019 bets of \u00a31.00/point on dominoes was the norm. \n\nIn the early 1970s the door on the right of the entrance was removed and the wall around the front right hand room to create a completely opened-up space to the lobby bar with modern fixed seating and, in 2014, the addition of a wood burner.   \n\nThe middle left room (originally, the Games Room, currently, the Quiet Room) has a double door width doorway, a good sectioned ceiling and a fireplace where the lower part looks modern but the mantlepiece is old as it includes a lovely tiled painting of Venice signed by W Yale. The fixed seating is modern. The internal window is a later addition, at the same time as the movement of the door in the Tap Room.  \n\nWilliam (Billy) Yale was born in Newport, Shropshire in 1843. He was employed by Copeland from c.1869-83, where he was known for painting marine views and winter scenes. After he left Copeland, he set up his own studio on Liverpool Road in Stoke-on-Trent advertising himself as 'a Tile and Slab Decorator'. During this time, he began decorating sagar ware plaques which he acquired from other potteries and fired in a kiln attached to his premises.  \n\nAt the rear left up three steps is a function room, originally the billiard room, which still retains its original bench seating on a platform for easy viewing of games. There are original bell pushes around the room but it has lost its fireplace (and the full sized snooker table).  \n\nRear right of the ground floor includes a room (originally a restaurant) which was last used in 1975. It is currently derelict. However, a restoration is planned. The building was built with a concert room on the first floor. \n\nIn July 2020, planning permission was granted for the installation of nine en suite rooms on the first floor in order to allow the pub to offer accomodation. \n\nThere is also an active bowling green behind the pub. It is believed that this was originally built as part of the pub. It is currently used by Stocksbridge Friendship Bowling Club (founded 1911) on a long-term lease (over 10 years to run (2015)).",

        "Pub Name": "New Barrack Tavern",
        "Address": "601 Penistone Road, Sheffield: North, Hillsborough, S6 2GA",
        "Description": "A Duncan Gilmour\u2019s pub which in 1936 was re-built when the original stone built corner terrace pub was demolished and the footprint extended into the next-door cottage, resulting in a larger building which continued to utilise the original cellar. It has a striking exterior of red brick and yellow terracotta with a brown glazed stone dado (the Rutland Arms in Sheffield has a similar exterior). There are a number of original (or good copies) of Gilmour\u2019s exterior windows including \u2018Gilmour\u2019s Windsor\u2019 and \u2018Billiard Room\u2019. A three-quarter sized snooker table was removed about ten years ago. The floor plan is little altered as can be confirmed by the original plans in a frame on the wall of the smoke room.  \n\nOn the staircase to the front door there is a \u2018Gilmour\u2019s\u2019 step. The lobby has a terrazzo floor and wall tiling to two-thirds height in mainly a cream colour.  A door on the left leads to the pubic bar which has a terrazzo floor, inter-war fixed seating. The bar counter is original 1936 one but has been moved slightly back as indicated by where the terrazzo floor stops short of it and some new tiled floor. The bar back fitting is more modern.  \n\nThe lobby bar has the original curved bar and a terrazzo floor which extends into the far left room. Until the summer of 2018, the latter was a kitchen. It is now a sympathetically converted drinking area and bottle-shop. The bar area includes the remnants of an off-sales hatch  - the off sales door with its \u2018Off Sales\u2019 etched window is situated in High House Terrace. It is currently covered by an advertising board.  \n\nWith the exception of the, now demolished, outside toilets, the 1936 floor plan remains: the public bar, with original bench seating, the corridor bar, a large concert  room and a smaller back room. Contrary to many assumptions, the rear right room (now the pool room) despite having two ceiling heights was part of the 1936 rebuild (the \u2018Smoke Room\u2019) and is not a later addition.  \n\nTo the rear was originally a yard which included outside toilets. The only internal change of use is that the scullery has become the men\u2019s toilet, with the ladies a 2002 addition at the rear of the property.  \n\nThe yard has become an attractive award-winning beer garden which has further extended into the yard of the adjoining building. Until the early 1990\u2019s, this neighbouring building included a shop which extended outwards. This extension was demolished when Penistone Road was widened. At that time, it was \u2018Carter\u2019s Sandwich Shop.\u2019  \n\nThe lounge displays some original plans and various photographs. 2015 saw an extension, into what was originally the neighbouring shop, and the creation of a new function room with its own bar and toilets. This utilises floorboards from an upstairs room to create the bar front. The remainder of the building is used for storage.  \n\nThe pub name refers to the nearby Hillsborough Barracks which date from 1848, replacing an inadequate barracks at Hillfoot. In 1932, the complex was sold to Burdall\u2019s Ltd, a manufacturing chemist noted for its gravy salt.",

        "Description": "Re-built of stone in the mid 1920s for Duncan Gilmour, Brewers (architects: Hall & Fenton, Sheffield), the interior was changed in c1949 when the small servery situated just inside the pub and an off sales to the right of the porch were removed; the present centrally situated servery added; and toilets brought inside. Apart from the opening-up of the smoke room on the right (in the 1980s?) the interior is little changed since 1949 with two (was three) rooms still including an active billiard room. It has a lovely set of Gilmour\u2019s etched and frosted exterior windows, some with their Windsor Castle symbol.  \n\nThe entrance lobby has a mosaic floor and a dado of 1920s tiling in cream and green and an inner door in a good screen. Across the front of the pub is the single room main bar originally the Lounge & Dining Room on the left and the Smoke Room on the right but a small piece of wall including the door to the smoke room has been removed (in the 1980s?). The bar counter is the c.1949 one with a modern top and has a row of tiles at the top and the back fitting is from c.1949 with some modernisation. There is some 1920s panelling one piece of wall on the left, in the former smoke room area on the right and also on the left there is 1920s fixed seating which has been re-fitted and boxed-in, and there is a modern tiled dado in the former off sales area and to the right of the servery.  \n\nAt the rear left is the billiard room now with a three-quarter sized table (presumable replacing a full sized one). The fixed seating looks to be the original from the 1920s but has been re-fitted and boxed-in. There are three good 1920s baffles by doors \u2013 two by the door to the corridor created in c.1949 leading to the toilets. There is a small counter from c.1949 with a modern top. The fireplace looks like a replacement (or is it the c.1949 one?). There is a Club Room above the billiard room which is still in use for meetings. \n\nThe first mention of the name, Princess Royal in a Directory is in 1937. Also, in that year, the building was designated as a Public House, not, as previously, a Beerhouse. Also note, the mention of Licensed for Billiards above the entrance door.\n\nThe first mention of a phone number is in a 1954 Directory. The pub has had the same phone number since then. Gilmours were taken over by Tetleys (Leeds) in 1954 \u2013 perhaps the telephone was installed at this point?",

In June 2014, the badly damaged yellow\nand brown tiles were painted over in red. The pub is now painted black. Although the interior of four rooms has been opened-out the layout is still visible, there is some inter-war tiling on the right hand side of the corridor into the pub and one nearly intact room.   \n\nA 1938 plan indicates that three rooms on the right side of the pub ('Dram Shop,' 'Service,' 'Smoke Room' and 'Kitchen') were  opened out into a single 'Public Bar,' a larger 'Service Area' and an external off-sales into Bailey Street (Architect: Fenton & Robinson for Duncan Gilmour). 1974 plans proposed that the internal snug become a male toilet while the off-sales was to be removed and the servery re-configured (Architect: D.K.Davy for Joshua Tetley). It seems that these alterations did not materialise as 1977 plans indicate the sung in place and a further slight reconfiguration of the servery (Architect: Shepherd, Fowler & Robinson for Joshua Tetley). A year later, further alterations saw the servery move away from the outside wall to its current position. Further alterations in 1989 saw the pub extend into a neighbouring shop, creating the sung to the left of the entrance (Architects: L.B.Percival for Joshua Tetley).   \n\nHead for the snug at the rear left, which is very small and has its original door. Around the room the old fixed seating remains with a wide panel above still having the bell pushes from the days of table service. There is a hatch to the back of the servery which is a relatively modern addition and when cut out a small section of the fixed seating was removed and plain baffles added both sides. The fireplace is also very old but has a modern hearth and there are tiles that have been painted so are difficult to date.   \n\nThe front left room has been opened-out to the corridor and has modern fixed seating and fireplace. Front right room has a blocked-up front door but no old fittings. The modern servery is centrally situated. The rear room has a wide doorway, fixed seating from the 60/70s, fireplace with tiled interior also looks modern, there is a (modern) small hatch / counter to the side of the servery and there is a good Gilmour\u2019s mirror.",

        "Pub Name": "Fagan's",
        "Address": "69 Broad Lane, Sheffield, City Centre, S1 4BS",
        "Description": "Probably, the oldest pub in central Sheffield, build c1790. It is documented on an 1815 plan, 'Barrel Public House, Broad Lane, measured for Rawson & Co.' This indicates that the current left-hand room was, at that time, a neighbouring tenement, the pub and the tenement sharing a yard at the rear of the property.\n\r\nThe last major change to the interior was in 1953 (architect, John Foster). A plan of the 'Proposed Alterations' indicates that the only structural changes are: (1) an extension which includes the current inside toilets. This necessitated the blocking of a window in the Public Lounge. (2) removal of an internal wall opposite the bar, thus opening up the tap room into the current larger, 'Lounge Hall.'\n\r\nIt is little changed since then apart from the adding of a small room at the back that was previously private quarters.\n\r\nThe front left room is a 1953 amalgamation of two small rooms. The walls were covered in full height ply panels and the fixed seating looks to date from then. Front windows have \u2018Public\u2019 and \u2018Lounge\u2019 etched and frosted panels. The only change here is the cutting of a doorway at the rear to give better access to the toilets.\n\r\nOn the front right is a tiny snug originally called the dram shop \u2013 a pub room name only seen in the Sheffield area (the wording appears in the ceramic exterior of the Ship, Shalesmoor). The snug has a very old counter and the walls are covered with ply panelling from 1953. It has a \u2018Fagan\u2019s\u2019 etched and frosted exterior window and retains its door with the figure \u20181.\u2019\n\r\nThe main bar counter has ply panelled front from 1953 and the bar back is mostly from 1953 with some glass shelves. One fridge has replaced some of lower shelving. The row of small leaded glazed panels above the bar counter were added in c.1986.\n\r\nThere have only been three licensees in the past 100 years. Ex-Bomber Command, Joseph Michael (Joe) Fagan ran the pub from July 1948 until September 1985 becoming Tetley\u2019s longest serving landlord. A new sign was erected in 1985. After this sign rotted, it was replaced in 2008 with a sign which shows a photo of Joe against a bomber. Joe died only a few weeks after passing on the tenancy to the current Landlord, Thomas Patrick (Tom) Boulding.\n\r\nSheffield artist Pete McKee, famous for his comic cartoon paintings, took to the streets of Sheffield in April 2013 to a bigger canvas: the gable end of Fagans is the home of one of Pete's projects, 'The Snog'. At the time, this was the largest mural painted by Pete. The mural on the gable end at Fox Valley (Stocksbridge), completed in May 2016, dwarves this example.\n\r\nIn the 19th.century, the pub was owned by local brewer, Rawsons. In turn ownership passed to Gilmours, Tetleys, Allied Breweries and, currently, Punch Taverns.",

        "Pub Name": "Wellington",
        "Address": "1 Henry Street, Sheffield: Kelham Island, Kelham Island, S3 7EQ",
        "Description": "Built in 1839, the Wellington was refitted in 1940 and it retains many fixtures in the three-roomed layout from that time. The previous layout included a 'Smoke Rm.,' 'Small Tap Room,' 'Tap Room' and 'Public Bar.'  The servery was moved into the area previously occupied by the Small Tap Room; the former tap room on the front right had minor changes and became the smoke room; and the rooms on the left of the door (smoke room, tiny public bar and the servery) were converted into the new Tap Room (Architect: Wiggul, Inott & Ridgeway for Messrs Tennant Bros.Ltd). \n\nA passageway from the front door to the lobby bar area has a terrazzo floor, inter-war tiling to two thirds height and double internal doors with leaded glazed panels. The lobby bar has a terrazzo floor, and retains the 1940 ply panelled bar counter (but it has been pushed back some 18 inches in recent years \u2013 note how the terrazzo floor finishes short of the counter front). Note the unusual keyhole in the part of the bar on the right top section \u2013 was it to lock the staff hatchway in place? \n\nThe bar back fitting. Is mainly the 1940 one but there have been some modification such as small mirror pieces from the 1960s, and fridges & a glass washer have replaced two-thirds of lower shelving. A 2016 refurbishment introduced shelving to both the left and right of the bar area in similar design. The panelling on the walls of the lobby bar area and (painted) pine ceiling was installed in 1978 when new tenants, Gordon and Pauline Shaw, arrived. They left in 1983, having had a successful time, the (legendary) Highcliffe Folk Club taking up residence for a number of years. \n\nA door on the left with a leaded glazed panel in the top and the figure \u20183\u2019 leads to the tap room with inter-war fixed seating around most of it and it retains the 1940 ply panelled bar counter with a dark stain added. The wood section above the bar counter with two colourful leaded glass panels featuring birds was added in 2016. The exterior has 1930s stained and leaded windows but the fireplace is a reproduction (and inappropriate) Victorian-style one. The piece of wall near the counter is a modern addition having closed a gap created when the lobby bar counter was pushed back. \n\nOn the front right there is a room wide gap from the lobby bar with more 1930s exterior windows but the fixed seating is post-war and has lost its fireplace. The terrazzo floor continues to the right with another door with 1930s stained and leaded windows which did have the figure \u20181\u2019 recently replaced with \u2018WC\u2019 and beyond is a terrazzo passage that goes past a door with the figure \u20185\u2019 on it and the ladies\u2019 toilet has a 1930s door and terrazzo floor (modern tiles); the gents\u2019 toilet is modern. The numbers are from the days of licensing magistrates to indicate public rooms.  \n\nThe Wellington was originally the brewery tap for the A.H.Smith and Company, Don Brewery. In 1916, Tennants bought out Smiths, then following the 1962 takeover, Whitbread ran the pub.  \n\nThe late 1980s saw the pub becoming rundown, many original features becoming hidden. It became a free house in 1993 under the ownership of Neil and Sheila Clarke. At that time, the walls and ceilings were yellow and the bar was covered with hardboard. This was removed and stripped back to bare wood, before stain and varnish were added.  \n\nOver a period of some years, they renovated the building. The window frames were stripped and repainted, the wood was stained dark and varnished, the walls were papered and boarding was removed from the door to the toilets. They renamed the pub as The Cask and Cutler, establishing the Port Mahon Brewery in 2000. In 2006, when Neil and Sheila Clarke moved to France, Richard Appleton took on the pub, reinstated the old name and, after a two year pause, restarted and renamed the brewery, Little Ale Cart. The brewery has hosted a number of cuckoo breweries, most notably Steel City who were in residence from their inception in 2010 until 2013.  \n\nBrewing ceased in 2016, when the pub was taken on by Sheaf Inns (owner: James Birkett) joining two other pubs, the Blake and the Sheaf View, in this small local group. The pub was closed for a period, redecoration and some refurbishment occurring. It reopened in late September 2016 as the brewery tap for the nearby Neepsend Brewery.",

        "Description": "Re-built by Gilmour's Brewery in 1919 - the date is in stone above the entrance. Gilmours acquired the original pub when they took over Whitmarsh, Watson & Co. in 1906. The pub has been in the same family ownership for over 50 years and is little changed over this period of time. The main entrance on the left leads into an internal porch with a tiled dado and the inner door is in a full height part glazed screen. The layout is a lobby bar, two small rooms on the left and a former function room on the right which now has a full sized snooker table.  \r\n\r\nIn the lobby bar the bar back fittings looks like a 1960s one with Formica on the shelves and on the counter of the hatch to the billiard room; also some glass shelves and wood panelling-like wallpaper on the front of the hatch. In the lobby there are three arches areas high up with some decorative plasterwork and three more over the servery.  \r\n\r\nOn the right is a large room with a terrazzo floor and old fixed seating around most of the room and two plain baffles. There used to be a small stage on the window side and it was around 1970 when the present full sized smoker table was introduced. There is a marble, red glazed brick and cast iron fireplace with a coal burner in front of it; there is also a piano.  \r\n\r\nThe two small rooms on the left are, we were told, little altered with original fixed seating but are currently used for storage and no access yet obtained. The gents' toilet is little altered with an inter-war tiled dado painted white.  \r\n\r\nPlease note - the pub operates more like a club so you will find the door closed and any prospective visitor will have to ring the bell or ring ahead to arrange entry.",

        "Address": "13-17 Wicker, Sheffield, City Centre, S3 8HS",
        "Description": "A beer house has been on this site since 1796. The present building was built around 1900 by Messrs\u2019 Wheatley and Bates Ltd, a local wine, spirit and cigar merchants. They also produced temperance drinks in a \u2018black spruce beer brewery\u2019 such as hop bitters, soda water, sarsaparilla and their specialty, \u2018STYM\u2019. Short for \u2018Stimulate,\u2019 STYM was advertised as the \u2018Monarch of all Temperance Drinks.\u2019 In 1948, they sold out to Sheffield-based, Hope and Anchor Breweries who wanted their bottling plant to bottle Jubilee stout.  \n \nTwo entrances from the street lead to two contrasting bars (and a separate smoke room at the rear of the right hand bar). It almost looks like two pubs particularly following changes to the frontage in 1968 by Messrs. Charrington Yorkshire Breweries Ltd. who replaced the window with a new curved one.  \n \nOn the left is a basic drinkers L-shaped public bar with three exterior doors. A June 1913 plan shows the left hand door down the side led to the \u2018tap room\u2019; the corner door led to the \u2018snug,\u2019; and the middle front door led to the \u2018dram shop\u2019 \u2013 a local word for a public bar. Only the corner door is now in use and inside is a rare draught screen dating from Victorian times, which is curved and painted a bright red colour. There is a short Victorian draught screen also painted bright red near the middle entrance. The bar counter dates back to Victorian times and has pilasters with decorative brackets all painted black and between them panels painted a bright red colour which replaced the original panels in 2014. The bar counter top is the original to which modern tiles have been added. The mirrored bar back fitting looks to date from around 1968, when changes were made in the saloon bar. At the rear of the public bar are the toilets and in front of the ladies\u2019 on the right is an old screen painted black that is held in place by an iron stay attached to the wall; in front of the gents\u2019 is another old screen \u2013 both are rare survivors. There is a 1960s fireplace in the rear left area.  \n \nOn the right hand side of the building are two rooms that are currently only open on Friday and Saturday from 19:30. A 1913 floor plan shows originally there was a 'Wholesale Department' behind the right-hand door. This subsequently became an 'off-sales'. In 1968 the off-sales was lost, fixed seating added behind the new window and a new entrance lobby and door were added. The only changes since then are the removal of a small piece of fixed seating on the front left when a door was added to link the two bars.  \n \nThe saloon bar is narrow with a bar counter that was changed in 1968 \u2013 it originally extended to the front wall so the left hand two-thirds was changed into the present curved section. The bar back looks to date from 1968. Down the right hand side of the room are two bays of Victorian fixed seating with the decorative bench ends that resemble a (acanthus) leaf \u2013 there were minor changes to the front end in 1968.  \n \nAt the rear of the lounge bar beyond a part glazed partition wall is a snug (named as smoke room in the 1958 plans) still with its door and more of the Victorian fixed seating with decorative bench ends around the small room. On the 1913 floor plan this was originally described as an 'Office'. The seven bell pushes did work until they were disconnected some years ago. Above the fixed seating is panelling that looks more 1960s. 1983 saw the addition of new ladies toilets in the yard, with the existing ladies, at the rear of the right-hand room been extended and converted into a gents.",

        "Description": "The Sportsman was rebuilt in 1958 by the Worksop and Retford Brewery and is remarkably little altered with three rooms and two sizeable lobbies. The pub was designed by W.S.Daniel, Estates Surveyor for the Worksop and Retford Brewery; building work was carried out by J.E.Smith (Worksop) Ltd., Kilton Road, Worksop. The pub was rebuilt for road widening reasons and it is situated in the Hackenthorpe Conservation Area.  \r\n\r\nIt was the last pub to be built by the Worksop and Retford Brewery - the previous building was previously in the hands of Sheffield-based Old Albion Brewery who were taken over by the WRB in 1939. WRB were taken over by Tennants Brewery of Sheffield in 1958, who, in turn, who were taken over by Whitbread in 1962.  \r\n\r\nThere is a sizeable entrance lobby inside the front door. This originally included a hatch for off-sales. A door on the left leads to the games room which retains a bar counter of a distinctive 1950s style (new bar top 2016), the bar back fitting and the fixed seating are both original. It now has a pool table but until recently it was a three-quarter sized snooker table. A 1972 painting of the pub is displayed above the bar.  \r\n\r\nA door to the right of the lobby leads into the lounge bar with another distinctive 1950s style bar counter (new bar top 2016), the bar back fitting and the fixed seating are original. All bars have original canopies, the shape matching that of the bar. The linked bar feeds the three separate rooms.  \r\n\r\nA door on the right hand side of the lounge bar leads into a lobby with 1950s panelling to picture frame height all around. A door leads to the concert/function room at the rear with a new lino floor (2016), another bar counter of a distinctive 1950s style (new bar top 2016), the bar back has more bays than that in the lounge bar and the fixed seating is original. There is another large lobby at the rear off of which are the toilets. The wall tiles in the gents ante room and toilets themselves were 1950s light grey until replaced in 2016 and the original urinals have been replaced with a metal trough. The ladies has modern tiles.  \r\n\r\nAll the doors have distinctive 1950s style wooden handles on one side (brass plates on the \u2018push side\u2019). The windows have been replaced with uPVC.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2019. Now a Starbucks. hence the pub being re-categorised as Permanently Closed  Further information shown below. The accompanying photographs show the interior before the work took place. \n\nCarbrook Hall was purchased by a local company, West Street Leisure, in March 2017 and, after over 150 years as a pub, immediately closed. In May 2017, it became an Asset of Community Value (ACV) following a collaborative application from Sheaf Valley Heritage Group and Sheffield and District CAMRA. The following eighteen months saw a number of arson attempts and local press reports regarding the sale of various contents from the building.  \n\nIn Autumn 2018, planning permission was granted to create \u2018Starbucks Carbrook Hall,\u2019 a 60-seat, drive-through Starbucks. Almost \u00a31M was invested and the building re-opened on 9th.August 2019. The listed parts of the building should be safe for future generations. However, it is another loss to the independent trade for which Sheffield is famed.  \n\nThe original building was owned by the Blunt family from 1176. It was rebuilt in 1462, and was bought by Thomas Bright (Lord of the Manor of Ecclesall) in the late C16th. His descendant, John Bright, was an active Parliamentarian during the English Civil War, and the building was used as a Roundhead meeting place during the siege of Sheffield Castle. \n\nMost of the building was demolished in the C19th., what survives being the Grade II* listed stone wing that was added about 1620. By 1860 Carbrook Hall was a common beer house.  \n\nThe Old Oak Room is a C17th. panelled ground floor room with vine trail plaster frieze and enriched cross beam ceiling, also with vine trail. There is also an elaborate early C17th. oak chimneypiece with Corinthian columns and allegorical figures and Latin inscription on the over mantel. The motif represents \u201cWisdom trampling upon Ignorance\u201d. It also has framed panelling with painted decoration and a larger stone chimneypiece with corniced mantelshelf and over mantel flanked by unusual caryatids. There is also a door with shaped fielded panels, and three late C18th. panelled doors. As part of the 2019 refurbishment, the magnificent painted ceiling in the Old Oak Room was painted white. Our images, taken in 2016, show the previous colours. \n\nAbove this room, and now available to the public is another panelled room with a distinctive fireplace.",

        "Pub Name": "Lescar Hotel",
        "Address": "303 Sharrow Vale Road, Sheffield, Sharrow, S11 8ZF",
        "Description": "There was a major re-building by Mappins Brewery of Rotherham in the 1930s and much remains of the layout and fittings from that time. The only remains of the original 19th century building is at the rear right where a large former dining room is now the function room. The site was previously that of a water mill. 2022 saw a refurbishment. Changes included paintwork, new soft furnishings, a new floor covering in the tap room and an updated outdoor area with additional seating.  \r\n\r\nThe layout consists of a tap room at the front, the lounge beyond with a centrally placed servery between them, and former off-sales with its separate door on Lescar Lane. A snug at the rear left has been opened up to the lounge and a passage leads to the function room. Plans of 1955 by Wm Stones, who had just taken over Mappins Brewery, show a floor plan that is otherwise identical to the present one - the off-sales is visible but is now used for glass washing.  \r\n\r\nThe tap room has a lobby with a terrazzo floor, a dado of inter-war fielded panelling and doors with 1930s etched and frosted panels (3 in each). The bar counter dates from the inter-war period but fresh panels have been added to the front. The two sections of Art Deco fixed seating look to be from the late 1930s, but a third section on the right hand side was removed in the 1980s when the fireplace was lost. A modern replacement was installed in 2022 and a new section of curved bench seating added to its left (the seating to the right retains its old red leatherette). The rest of the bench seating now has the same brown leather covering, studded at the back and with a floral strip along the top.  \r\n\r\nA doorway leads to the lounge which also retains its lobby on the Lescar Lane side with a terrazzo floor, a dado of inter-war fielded panelling and doors with 1930s etched and frosted panels (3 in each). The bar counter dates from the inter-war period but as with the public bar has modern carved panels added to the front. The island gantry is totally modern. The Art Deco fireplace looks to be an import. The fixed seating is of an unknown date. There is some fielded panelling on the dado.  \r\n\r\nThe snug retains its Art Deco fixed seating which looks to be from the late 1930s but it was opened-up possibly in the 1980s. The fireplace has a 1930s wood surround but the cast-iron interior is modern.  \r\n\r\nA wide passage with a dado of fielded panelling and plaster decoration on the ceiling leads to the function room at the rear right. The plans of 1955 show a replacement bar counter moved to the present position, but the present one dates from the 1990s. The toilets have modern tiling.  \r\n\r\nThe Lescar is possibly unique in that the 1909 plans include the addition of a new 'Children's Entrance' on the Lescar Lane side of the building. These include a reference to Obscure Glass, \u2013 presumably so that the children could not see into goings-on inside (Architect: A.F.Watson, 88 Church Street, Sheffield) . The off-sales entrance leads directly to a serving door.",

        "Description": "UPDATE 2017.\n\nFollowing a recent change of hands, most of the 1950s fittings have been ripped out such as the off-sales bar counter (replaced by a modern door); the distinctive 1950s frontage of the main bar counter (replaced by modern wood which has been painted a \u2018gastro-grey\u2019 colour); and the bar back has lost most of its 1950s features such as the mirror mosaic back to be replaced by modern wood (also painted a \u2018gastro-grey\u2019 colour). This has led to this pub being re-categorised as Interior Ruined.  \n\nThe former description is shown below. \n\nPerched on the side of the Rivelin Valley, this 19th.century stone built pub still retains separate public bar, lounge bar and off sales hatch with rare 1950s fittings. The last major change was by Messr's. Duncan Gilmour and Co.Ltd. in 1951 (plan in the Sheffield Archives is by in-house Architect, John Foster LRIBA).  \n\nThe entrance porch (added in 1964 by Tetleys \u2013 information from a plan approved 17/11/1964) leads into a short passage with doors to the left and right. There is a very small counter (possibly used for off sales) in the passage with a distinctive 1950\u2019s front. \n\nOn the right the small tap room has a bar counter with a distinctive 1950\u2019s frontage and the three-bay bar back fitting has features including mosaic mirror panels that look to be from 1951. However, there are some modern shelves (the pot shelf is wholly modern). \n\nThe L-shaped lounge was shown as separate billiard room and tap room in the 1951 plan but just one room on the 1964 plan. The brick fireplace looks to be from the 1950\u2019s as does some bar back shelves but the bar counter looks more modern as does the fixed seating. Inside toilets were added in the 1950\u2019s but are modernised. A further extension took place in 1992 when a kitchen and store were added. \n\nThe term \u2018Hollins\u2019 was used to denote a place where holly grew, hence the name of the pub. Holly was used by farmers as feed stuff for their sheep \u2013 this was confirmed by Abraham de Prynne, writing in November 1696 \u201cIn South West Yorkshire, around Bradfield and in Derbyshire, they feed their sheep in winter with Holly leaves and Bark\u2026\u201d",

        "Address": "23 Alma Street, Sheffield: Kelham Island, Kelham Island, S3 8SA",
        "Description": "The Fat Cat is a little-altered and typically detailed example of a three-storey brick-built mid-C19th. pub and former hotel in, what was, an industrial quarter close to central Sheffield. It has an excellent original layout: two downstairs rooms, a small central bar, mosaic in the doorway and a terrazzo floor passageway.  In June 2018, local artist Matt Cockayne (Goo Design), spent three days painting a mural on the outside corner wall.\n\nThe pub was taken over by Sheffield brewer, William Stones in 1912 \u2013 note the mosaic floor in the small entrance lobby bearing the legend \"CANNON ALES\". Originally known as \u2018the Alma\u2019 after the Battle of the Alma River (SW Crimea) on 20/09/1854. It was re-named the Fat Cat in 1981 when the building was bought, at auction, for \u00a333,750 by Solicitor, Bruce Bentley and his business partner, Sheffield Polytechnic Economics Lecturer, Dave Wickett (1947-2012), becoming one of the first \u2018Real Ale Freehouses\u2019 in the UK. In 1989, Dave bought out the share owned by Bruce.  \n\nA plan dated 1914 shows a layout of a corridor from the front door with a terrazzo floor, a small public bar on the right, a small smoke room at the rear, and a tap room on the left. A plan dated 1941 details changes by Wm Stones brewery (architects Wigfull, Inott and Ridgeway, Sheffield) which include the amalgamation of the two small rooms on the right into a U-shaped public bar with a new servery and the blocking-up of the corner entrance door. The present layout is little changed since 1941. \n\nThe bar fittings in the public bar are mostly from 1941 such as the left hand mirrored back fitting. The wood around the staff entrance to the servery plus the half-height door and shelving is also old. In 1981 there were changes to the servery with a canopy including coloured glass over, and a clock under, also a rounded pediment was added \u2013 this is believed to be a payment settling kiosk brought from a Co-op butchers in Rotherham. Counter tops are recent.\n\nThere is a Victorian green tiled, cast iron and wood surround fireplace at the rear, fixed seating (date?) at the front. Between 1941 and 1982 doors were added at either side of the fireplace to access the toilets. In the 1980\u2019s, the right-hand internal door which led directly to the urinals was removed; customers were thus compelled to visit, via the corridor. \n\nThe tap room on the left has fixed seating that dates from the 1950/1960s and a Victorian style fireplace with tiled base. A 1982 plan shows that the 'Scullery,\u2019 'Pantry' and 'Coals' have changed into an extended 'Gents,' and a new 'Ladies W.C.' and 'Stores.' The 'Tap Room' has also became the No-smoking room, one of the first in a British pub - this fact was mentioned in the House of Commons by Bassetlaw MP Joe Ashton and therefore recorded in Hansard. The Fat Cat is one of a number of pubs which was flooded in both the 1864 and 2007 Sheffield floods. \n\nOn the first floor is a small dining room (originally the club room) with an old cast iron wood surround fireplace.1999 plans (Melling Ridgeway and Partners, Sheffield) show the conversion of the original Kelham Island Brewery into a Visitors' Centre. This was built in 1990 and was the first new independent brewery in Sheffield for over fifty years. The current brewery came into operation in 1999, Pale Rider (5.2% abv) becoming CAMRA Champion Beer of Britain (CBOB) in 2004.",

The interior of a single room is little changed since built which is rare for a post-war pub. \r\n\r\nIn the rear left of the room is the servery with a bar counter of red brick, part laid in herringbone style (something seen in inter-war pubs). The bar back fitting of three bays has 1950s style panelling in the two outside sections and the central part was originally a doorway to the cellar which was blocked-up in around 2000. There are old timbers from the Plumbers Arms around the top of the servery. The flagstone-style floor is probably a replacement following flood damage. \r\n\r\nOn the right hand side there is a large almost inglenook style fireplace of stone with more old Plumbers Arms timbers around it. The rest of the pub has walls of bare red brick. The gents appears unchanged since built. \r\n\r\nSome information from \u2018The Inns and Alehouses of York\u2019 by Alan Johnson (1989)",

Plans from the time (Wm.Fenton, Architect, Sheffield for Duncan Gilmour and Co.) indicate that the footprint of the new pub moved about 10 m back, thus allowing the corner between Brown Street and Furnival Street to take up its current position.

To the right of the Smoke Room are both male and female lavatories.\u2019 The fact that these are not situated outside is an indication of the relative importance of this new build. \n\n1952 plans (J.Foster, Architect for Duncan Gilmour and Co.) show the opening out of the public bar and smoking room into a larger Lounge Hall. 1988 (L.B.Percival, Architect for Josuha Tetley and Son Ltd.) saw the lounge and tap room merged and the reconfiguration of the bar into its current position. \n\nIn addition to a considerable amount of Art Deco-style interior glasswork (installed in 1952) and the Off Sales window, the only remaining original Gilmour\u2019s window, the Rutland has a very impressive tiled exterior. \u2018DUNCAN GILMOUR & Co.

        "Pub Name": "Silver Fox",
        "Address": "839 Manchester Road, Sheffield, Stocksbridge, S36 1DR",
        "Description": "This substantial stone-built pub is set back from the road. The interior is little changed with two bars and a rear passageway with seating. The upstairs functions room remains virtually untouched. On entering, a large panelled lobby area leads to rooms on either side. There are two hatches to the servery that were the original off sales.\n\nThe Tap Room is on the left, with the toilets behind. On the right is a large Lounge/Restaurant with a small stage. The central bar feeds both rooms. \n\nThe bar on the left retains the original bar counter front that has a number of mirrored panels and a wooden surround, but the original light oak wood now has a very dark stain to it. A new wooden top has been added over the original Formica one but two small sections are still visible. The bar back fitting consists of the original lower part and then in more recent times a section has been added on top. Hence, previously each bar was visible from the other. Most of the lower shelving is intact with fridges under the counter. The fixed seating looks to be the original but there has been changes to the flooring as in the South Yorkshire Times  report of the opening, a parquet floor and a York stone paving apron to the bar are described. The article also mentions a large natural fireplace, which has been removed.\n\nThe lounge bar on the right retains the original bar counter front, mirrored panels and a wooden surround but the original light oak wood now has a very dark stain. A new wooden top has been added over the original Formica one. The fixed seating is a later addition as the newspaper article mentions a large natural fireplace, which was on the side wall (west elevation) and has been removed. There looks to have been changes to the flooring as in the local newspaper reporting of the opening the floor was described as having a border of random tiles. The only internal change since opening was the 1992 remodelling of the stage and addition of a DJ space (Joshua Tetley and Son Ltd.). A plan indicates this room was originally the lounge and a music (or function) room with a stage. \n\nThere is a hallway at the rear with one table and a few chairs in a tiny area on the far left. The Gents retains its original urinals but has modern wall tiling.   \n\nUpstairs, double glazed doors with the word, Restaurant above, lead into the dining room. In the left hand corner there is the intact servery consisting of a quarter circle panelled counter of Japanese quartered oak. The original bar back fitting has intact shelving, plain bevelled mirrors and glass shelves in the upper part. Close by is the vestibule also of oak panelling to two-thirds height leading to the kitchen. On the front (north) elevation there are the three raised alcoves mentioned in the newspaper article. The whole room has a fielded dado of Japanese quartered oak, all the panelling is very inter-war in style. Four wooden chairs may also be survivors. The upstairs kitchen has a functioning set of in-out doors. For several years, this room acted as a junk-repository.  It returned to use in early 2018.\n\nOff the landing are the toilets which remain intact but are awaiting restoration to bring them back into use. The Gents has blue tiled walls and original urinals. The Ladies has original pink tiled walls.\n\nBuilt for Tetleys and officially opened on 19th.April 1963, the Summer 1963 edition of Fox Magazine comments: 'the Hotel is fully catering (although not residential), has a superb wine list and an extensive luncheon and dinner menu at most reasonable prices. The dining room and service is a credit to Tetleys and the town.' The 1963 hotel sign board was executed by The Birmingham Guild for Oldham Signs Ltd., for Tetleys, the fox head being in Silver Fox stainless. \n\nThe South Yorkshire Times states, 'This is Joshua Tetley and Sons first venture into the provision of restaurant amenities in any of their many South Yorkshire premises, and no expense had been spared in this enterprise.'\n\nThe pub is named in honour of the nearly stainless steel manufacturing firm of Samuel Fox and Co. Ltd. The name is believed to refer to Locomotive 60017 Silver Fox. Built in 1935 as LNER No.2512, this engine was one of four 4-6-2 locomotives which worked the Silver Jubilee express from Kings Cross to Newcastle. Under British Rail, it became 60017. Local company, Samuel Fox and Co.Ltd. supplied stainless steel for the lagging band, window frame, hand rails, couplings and nameplates and a relief of a fox on either side of the boiler .",

        "Pub Name": "Queen's Ground Hotel",
        "Address": "401 Langsett Road, Sheffield, Hillsborough, S6 2LJ",
        "Description": "Three-storey of stone which may date back to the c.1870 and originally a Ward\u2019s pub. The inner lobby created by a full height glazed screen has a distinctive terrazzo floor with the wording 'Queen\u2019s Ground Hotel.' The name originated from the cricket and athletics ground which was situated at the back of the pub. The name changed from \u2018Queens Ground Hotel\u2019 to \u2018Queens Ground\u2019 in the 1960s. \r\n\r\nA plan of 1913 shows the original layout of the Tap Room on the left, Smoke Room on the rear left, and the Billiard Room front right with a bar counter in a lobby forward of the front door. The tap room was separated from then then servery by a glazed screen which formed the bar back. Nowadays, the door on the left of the lobby leads into what is a mainly open-plan interior which dates from changes in 1973 when the present bar counter was added to replace the original bar counter and its rear screen; also removed were the wall to the right of the lobby. \r\n\r\nTo the left of the entry, the original tap room has the inter-war wording \u2018Smoke Room\u2019 with a S.H.Wards 'sheaf' symbol above on the exterior bay window and highly detailed decorated coving, which could date from c.1870. The rear left former smoke room has fielded panelling to picture-frame height with bell pushes around the room but as we have no plans to indicate an older date it may only date from 1973 when an extra doorway on the left was cut into the wall between the front left and rear room. The panelling covers up a rear window and an original fireplace situate at the front of this area. \r\n\r\nOn the front right is the original billiard room (note the inter-war wording on the front bay windows with S.H.Wards 'sheaf' symbol above). The highlight here is the fine fireplace of inter-war design with copper interior fittings/hood. Look for the damage to the cooper at the top right of the fireplace which is believed to have been caused from constant hits from the swinging hanging snooker chalk. The rear right room was originally living quarters until the extensive 1973 refit and is the new billiard room. It has a three-quarter-size size snooker table with raised seating around the room and is served from a new hatch to the back of the servery. \r\n\r\nAnother feature of note is the semi-circular 'Wards Fine Malt Ales Wines Sprits' leaded window high up above the left hand side of the servery. Although it does fit perfectly implying it was always there it was originally, it has moved from its original position \u2013 possibly on a glazed screen that formed the bar back as the plans show it has only been in that position since 1973. Other changes in 1973 include adding the present toilets to replace outside ones.",

        "Pub Name": "White Swan",
        "Address": "Greenhill Main Road, Sheffield, Greenhill, S8 7RB",
        "Description": "Designated the focal building of the Greenhill Conservation Area, this two-storey pub of stone has five rooms. It was subject to a 1960 refit by Tennants (M.W.Ofield, Architect, Exchange Brewery) and apart from the addition of a dining room to the rear (without major impact on the layout) it has changed little in over 40 years. \n\nThe room with the most character is the front right lounge which is completely fielded panelled to picture frame height making it seem like inter-war work but it too dates from 1960 as does the small curved counter. The wood surround of the fireplace dates from 1960 but the interior is a Victorian reproduction. The room is entered by a door from the front lobby and has a widish gap to the rear right room. \n\nThe front door led into an off sales in 1960 but the wall that separated it from the front left games bar was removed in 1988 and the curved bar counter also dates from that date but is of similar style to the two-sided one it replaced and the one in the rear bar. Fixed seating looks 1960s as does the bar back with its carved top section. \n\nThe rear left lounge bar is accessed by doorways from the front left and rear right and has a panelled counter with a black painted front that dates from 1960, but has a modern mirrored bar back. The small curved stone fireplace with a copper band looks very 1960s. Through a widish gap at the rear is the dining room added in 1980 and has a well (recently covered over). The fixed seating is 60s in style to match that elsewhere and there is a large baffle. \n\nThe rear right hall with a high ceiling has a modern flagstone-like floor and is a creation from 1960 with a panelled counter (now with a light brown stain). The bar back is unusual with small square panels and a top section with decorative strapwork and is also believed to date from 1960.",

        "Pub Name": "Eyre Arms",
        "Address": "Hassop Road, Hassop, DE45 1NS",
        "Description": "The building was originally a farmstead, built in 1632. By 1753, 'Eyre Arms as a Public House at Hassop. In 1814, the name changed to Newburg Arms Inn and in 1902, it returned to the Eyre Arms (but Historic England say it is 19th century). This attractive creeper covered sandstone building was subject to a good quality refit in the mid 1950s and is virtually unchanged since. Apparently local craftsmen were used to do the work: stonemason for the fireplaces and carpenter for the bar front and wood panelling. Relatives of these craftsmen are still pub regulars. One of the least altered interiors of this date with three rooms and intact toilets.\r\n\r\nA plan (found in the Derbyshire Record Office, Matlock) dated 1952 shows a very different interior - the front entrance led into a hall and on the left was the Tap Room (now the public bar), while to the right are steps (up) and a Smoke Room. Ahead was a passage with a servery at the rear and a sitting room on the rear right. \r\n\r\nThe pub was sold by the Stevensons, owners of Hassop Hall, to Stones Brewery of Sheffield in the early 1950s. In 1953, Stones carried out a significant refurbishment creating the centrally placed servery for all three rooms - to the front left and right and also a snug at the rear where the former servery was situated. The lounge on the right is a combination of the front smoke room and the sitting room (Wigfull Inott & Ridgeway, Chartered Architects, Sheffield 1 for Messrs Wm Stones Ltd - original plan located at the Peak District National Park Authority, Aldern House, Baslow Road, Bakewell, DE45 1AE.) \r\n\r\nThe front door leads to a small entrance lobby with tiled floor. An oak latched door to the left has Public Bar painted in gold and on the frame above is painted the Roman numeral I. An oak latched door on the right has gold painted lettering Saloon Room over which a metal sign Lounge and on the frame above is the Roman numeral II. The left small Public Bar has a carpet, stone Tudor arch-style fireplace found in pre-war pubs that was added in 1953 and quality high-backed fitted seating on two sides of the room. There is a quarter circle bar with a counter of wooden tongue and groove of high quality including a small linenfold section. The bar back is of a 1950s style with azed wood on the frame and no loss of lower shelving. The walls are of rough stone and painted white and a door at the rear leads to a short passage. There is a Roman numeral I on the back of the door, a door on the left of the passage has the Roman numeral IV and Cellar painted in gold. Another door has Private on it. Alongside is a door with Gentlemen on it. A door on the right of the passage has the gold painted wording Snug and III.\r\n\r\nThe right hand carpeted Lounge Bar being two rooms prior to 1953 has two different ceilings higher plain one at the front and lower beamed one in rear part. In the front part is a curved bar counter with a small linenfold section and the bar back is 1950s style with azed wood frame. On the front right is a different style of stone fireplace to the public bar one often seen in pre-war pubs, and above it is a massive plaster Coat of Arms with a dull yellow coloured ceramic (?) decorative border. The arms belong to Rowland Eyre, a Royalist officer in the Civil War. The Eyres raised a regiment in Derbyshire and fought at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. There is more azed wood above the change in ceiling height. On the front wall side is more of the high backed fitted seating, a long case clock, and the walls are of bare stone. In the rear part are more of the high backed fitted seating on the left and right and low backed bench seating on the rear wall. An oak latched door on the front right hand side leads to the kitchen and one on the rear right leads to the ladies toilet. \r\n\r\nAn oak latched door leads from the rear left part of the lounge to the snug at the middle rear and has the Roman numeral II painted on it in gold. Formerly the site of the servery (and possibly a shop in the past?) it is a small room with a modest counter, almost a hatch, having a 1950s frontage. There is more of the high-backed fitted seating, one low backed bench and a door leads to the passage situated at the rear left.\r\n\r\nThe gents toilet has a red tiled floor and inter-war style cream tiled walls to picture-frame height throughout with a row of light green tiles along the bottom and top and retains the 1950s urinal with the only change being a wooden WC door added in 2016. Added in 1953 it replaced the outside gents situated on the front left of the building as detailed in the 1952 plan, which also shows the ladies was also outside on the right. The ladies are situated where the 1952 plan shows was the larder and also has inter-war style cream tiled walls to picture-frame height throughout with a row of light green tiles along the bottom and top. Again, the only changes are the wooden WC doors added in 2016.\r\n\r\nThe pub sign shows the Eyre family coat of arms. The arms on the wall of the lounge belong to Rowland Eyre, a Royalist officer in the Civil War. The Eyres raised a regiment in Derbyshire and fought at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. The centrepiece is a solitary leg. Apparently, at the Battle of Hastings (1066), William the Conqueror was knocked from his horse. He was assisted by a soldier (called Trulove) who loosened the Kings helmet as his nose-plate was crushing his face. William then said \"thou hast given me the air that I breathe - henceforth you will be known as Air (Eyr)\". Later in the battle, the King discovered that Truelove (Eyr) had to have a leg amputated. William told him that when he was recovered, he would give him some land. The soldier replied, I shall call it Hope, for you have given me hope to live. There are two problems with this story: the Norman soldiers did not wear helmets of this type, and Truelove was an Anglo-Saxon name, not Norman.\r\n \r\n Closed all day Monday.",

The ground floor was given an impressive exterior in the early 1900s so the ground floor is covered in dark green tiling with ceramic light green archways around door and windows. The fascia is of cream coloured tiling with, from the left Lyme Street side the wording \u201cOFF\u2019 \u2018LICENSE\u2019 \u2018PRINCE ALBERT\u2019, on the Georgiana Street elevation \u2018PALE\u2019 \u2018CHARRINGTON\u2019S\u2019 \u2018ALES\u2019, and on Royal College Street side \u2018PRINCE ALBERT\u2019, \u2018PALE\u2019 AND \u2018CHARRINGTON\u2019S\u2019.

Charrington\u2019s brewed at the Anchor Brewery and when they bought Hoare & Co in 1933 who had a symbol of the Toby Jug it was adopted by Charringtons\u2019.

        "Pub Name": "Lord Palmerston",
        "Address": "252-254 Forest Road, Walthamstow, Higham Hill, E17 6JG",
        "Description": "Large corner-site ex-Charrington pub of two floors, constructed of red brick with some glazed tiling on the ground floor wall. The pub name is depicted in bas relief terracotta on the first floor corner facing. The first recorded licensee is in 1905 when the pub was probably newly built by Saville Brothers brewery of Stratford, who were taken over by Charringtons in 1925. An off licence was originally located at the far left hand side of the Forest Road elevation, but is now subsumed into the main pub area.  \r\n\r\nThe corner door is signed as the public bar; an unused door on Palmerston Rd led to a saloon bar to the right of the public bar, but this is now a single room. The unused door has etched/cut glass screens to either side that look original, and are probably remnants of a vestibule entrance to the saloon bar. Tiled fireplace at the back of the room. \r\n\r\nThe servery sits between the public/saloon bar and the lounge bar. The bar back is original mahogany, with five mirror-backed bays on both the public/saloon and lounge bar sides, carved wooden posts separating the bays, and concave wooden frame at the top. Lower shelving lost to fridges. An original dumb waiter is at the end of the bar back, now disused and containing drinks bottles, etc. The bar counter also looks original, with extravagant pilasters and fielded panelling with arched tops. The bar counter top in both rooms has light brown inlaid linoleum or a similar material. Tell-tale key holes in the counter front show where hinged panels would have allowed access to, and servicing of, the beer engines.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar has matchboard panelling on the dado, but now painted cream. A wall separates the public bar from the lounge bar to the left, with a normal sized doorway in it, and both the door and entranceway look to be relatively modern additions. Also separating the public bar from the lounge bar is a large baffle (approx six feet high rising from the bar counter, and the total width of the counter) adjoining the separating wall, containing etched/cut glass panels with arched tops.  \r\n\r\nBehind the servery is a door leading to the kitchen and private rooms, framed and surmounted by mahogany surrounds in the same design as the bar back, and with a mirror backed bay to either side. \r\n\r\nTo the left part of the lounge a cream painted wooden screen with fielded panelling and framed openings to the upper parts separates that part of the lounge into two distinct areas. The area on the left has a plain fireplace, while the area on the right has an ornate wood surround and tiled fireplace, and staircase to the first floor. \r\n\r\nBehind the lounge is a large ex-billiard room with the skylight blocked in, now used as a pool room. There is an antique cabinet at the back containing sporting trophies.",

        "Description": "Mentally strip away such evidently modern work as the paintwork on the panelling, the modern glass in the frontage and the removal of plaster on one wall on the right, and you can get a good sense of a substantial interwar (probably 1930s) refit. The left-hand part is the most intact with panelling, counter and nice chequerwork floor tiling in front of the latter. On the right the counter has clearly been removed (see the mark in the floor). You can\u2019t miss the remains of a full-height screen that once divided the pub. In fact, this forms the right-hand part of what would have been a former off-sales (traces in a former outside door and marking in the woodwork). The area on the rear left side (now opened up) no doubt once provided a separate \u2018better class\u2019 room.",

        "Description": "This imposing three-storey Victorian corner pub has some real delights. Behind the fa\u00e7ade with its hefty iron columns, the interior has, sadly, been much opened out but with the multiple external doors, right-hand vestibule and former corridor mosaic, you can get some sense of the original, subdivided layout. But pride of place goes to the rather stunning central servery and its back fitting and vestiges of the publican\u2019s office. It\u2019s embellished with classical columns and a rich cornice, although unfortunately the back fitting in the left hand room has now been painted a light cream colour with the exception of the gold capitols on the columns. The counter top in the right hand room has a linoleum inlay.  \r\nAnother noteworthy feature is the large screen with a wide opening that separates the two rooms, extending across both the public area and the servery. This screen, as well as the counter front, has been painted a dark blue/green colour. On either side of the servery opening are original cut glass panes. It is likely that to the left of the screen would have been the off-sales, which means that a second screen separating it from the left hand room has been lost. \r\nOn the right, just beyond the former mosaic-floored corridor, is an impressive two-bay mirrored feature with display cabinets above.",

        "Description": "Brick-built pub on the site of a couple of houses in the interwar years (probably Thirties). The plain fa\u00e7ade conceals a pub that\u2019s still divided into two parts by two-thirds height timber partitions, both sides of which are served from a central servery \u2013 very rare for London. As so often with such a layout the two parts are linked by a passage across the back giving common access to the gents\u2019. The door in the rear partition has been lost.  \r\n\r\nThe right hand door leads to the lounge with a carpet. On the rear right-hand side there is an adaptation of an inglenook fireplace arrangement of inter-war brick (not in use as covered by a couch); there are doors leading off it. There is fielded panelling around the inside and above it and, unusually, there is a ladies toilet off it at the rear. Fielded paneling around the room to two-thirds height. Inter-war counter front painted black with a still working heated footrail. The bar back is island style but looks 60/70s work with glass shelves and a ply back.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar on the left has lino in the front part and carpet in the rear part. It retains the original 1930s bar counter, curved at the rear and with a still working heated rail. Fielded paneling around the room to two-thirds height. There is an Art Deco shaped stone fireplace painted black on the rear left wall. Same island bar back i.e. 1960/70s. There are three original fixed benches, one is attached to the front partition. There is signs of a door in the front middle of the pub so maybe there was an off-sales (or small snug?) and a partition lost. Within the servery on both sides the under counter shelf and wash basin are of pewter and there are wooden cupboards.",

At the rear of the room are the toilets with separate doors to the gents with its leaded glass top half and ladies which has lost its leaded glass. Curiously, between the toilet doors are three seemingly once external leaded windows. At the right rear are two sets of double doors on the corner, one leading to the restaurant upstairs and the other set of double doors leading behind the bar and connecting to the rear lounge and a publican\u2019s office situated behind the three bars. Only this has leaded glass in the top half. Saloon bar has three-quarter height fielded panels throughout: its counter has panels of vertical wood (but new counter top) with brass covered foot rest. Bar back probably from the same date as the refit though the bottom half has been lost to cooling cabinets. Above the servery is an Arts and Crafts-style timbered overhang containing eight plaster panels depicting Tudor era emblems and motifs. \n\nThe small middle bar has a counter with different panels to the saloon bar and no brass-covered foot rest. By the left-hand screen (with leaded glass) next to the main entrance to the saloon bar is a smaller doorway which has been blocked of and hidden behind the fielded panelling with an air vent inserted. The top of the bar back looks modern. \n\nTwo narrow glazed screens (possible lost a door here) on the right leads to the public bar which has its own entrance by the corner of the building with a vestibule again with leaded glass. The servery here has a modern pot shelf supported by two turned wooden columns, modern counter top and the bar back looks modern too. The bar front has what looks like large painted panels which maybe from the interwar refit? Brass covered foot-rest similar to the saloon bar counter. \n\nAnother set of glazed double doors leads to the lounge at the rear which has a small three-sided bar counter on the left-hand side with different panelling to the other bar counters. It too has a modern counter top. There is a set of double doors from the side road but at the rear is a blocked off door next to some curved banquette seating. It looks like there were two rooms here now opened up. Again, the lounge has similar fielded panelling to the rest of the pub.",

The ladies has inter-war white dado tiling with a green border throughout; gents toilets have no old fittings.\n\r\nPublic bar on Shooters Hill side of the pub is entered through a vestibule with a tiled floor and two doors (only the right one in use). This indicates two rooms have been knocked together. Additionally, a corner door is now bricked up (many years ago?) which locals claim led to a snug. Frosted panels in the surviving doors. The counter - from the appearance of the hatch - seems old, but has been refronted and a new top added in the 1960s. Parts of the bar back (wooden arch, pillars) are original, but mosaic mirrors, illuminated panels on the top of the bar back with \u2018The Bull\u2019 and a Courage Cockerel; and shelving look to be addition from c.1960.

The counter has a panelled front with at the top a section of Formica, which is also on the top. 1960s style fixed seating runs down the right hand side with panelling above. \r\n\r\nOn the front left the snug is created by two wooden partitions with a widish gap between them and no sign it ever had a door(s). It has the same fixed seating as the main bar and a small narrow table firmly fixed to the floor. There is a ladies toilet off it presumably added in the 1970s?

Front right bar has a counter that may date from the 1930s and an inter-war brick fireplace. Half way down the passage on the right is a curved two-piece window with the lower section able to be raised. In this area is the saloon with an old dado of fielded panelling which was lightened c.2013 and a stone Tudor-arch fireplace (age?). Lovely wavey bar couynter with linen fold panels along it and the bar back shelving looks old. Rear dining room has fielded panelling on the walls, recently painted gastro-grey and some pargeting on the ceiling.",

There is no music, the TV is rarely switched on, food is only sold on a Friday night, the pool table is tucked away and the fruit machine no longer works! \r\n\r\nCentre of village terraced and rendered two-storey building with two entrance doors. The left entrance still has its \u2018Lounge\u2019 illuminated sign above the door from the days of Watneys ownership. The inner door leads to a small red quarry tiled floor room having a 1950s brick fireplace with a coal fire, small bare benches to the left and right of the fireplace, and wall benches under the front and rear windows. There is a small counter with possibly a hardboard front painted claret. \r\n\r\nUp a step to the right is a narrow area in front of the servery with only space for bar stools. The sloping counter front might be of hardboard painted claret. The bar back has a mirror mosaic backing and wooden shelving so looks very 1960s. \r\n\r\nUp two steps and through a doorway to a room on the right with a bare wood floor and a lovely 1930s Art Deco tiled fireplace with a stove in front of it and an Ind Coope Burton Ales mirror. There is a brick arch opening to the servery i.e. cut into the wall and darts. The right hand exterior entrance that leads to this room has a \u2018bar\u2019 illuminated sign above the door from the days of Watneys ownership. \r\n\r\nOn the left of the red tiled floor room is a door with the figure \u20181\u2019 leading to a small room with carpet, a pool table but no old fittings. Closed on Monday; opens from 6pm Tue to Sat; Sun 12 to 6.",

        "Description": "In two buildings \u2013 three-storey 18th century one on the left and a 17th century timber-framed one of two storeys with a carriage entrance on the left part. A pub with a very long history, probably stretching back to Tudor times. The list of licensees (displayed in the back bar) has been traced from 1759. \r\n\r\nSome of the panelling in an upstairs room (not with public access) appears to be 17th-century. What distinguishes the pub in terms of its interior is the array of dark, generally plain panelling which is 18th-century and/or Victorian and gives a good impression of the surroundings countless thousands of drinkers would have experienced in pubs throughout the land a century and more ago. The large back room, now shared with an on-site brewery, is a Victorian addition and it is here that the servery is now located. \r\n\r\nThe panelling is the main feature, but there are detectable traces of a (probably at least prewar) layout in the front two rooms, and the side passage with surviving stable blocks (although strictly speaking not part of the \"interior\", although it is laid out as a partly-covered drinking space) also gives you an idea of how the pub operated in the past, presumably as a coaching inn.",

(see \u2018IBL\u2019 monogram on first floor on Crown Street side) in 1887. Then in the inter-war period a building was erected to the left and the pub acquired part of the ground floor to double the floor area. You need to carefully inspect the ground floor exterior to see the difference \u2013 the frontage looks the same but the row of small windows along the top of the exterior window are slightly different \u2013 those on the original building have rounded corner panel on the far left and right but on the more modern part they do not. \r\n\r\nAfter the inter-war refit, the pub looks to have had a three-room (with possibly an off-sales?) layout. The present layout is three rooms (maybe minus the off sales). There is a wide arch between the right hand room and front left room and a narrow arch-shaped opening between the front left room and rear left room. \r\n\r\nOn the left are two inter-war counters and two decent quality bar backs \u2013 the one in the front section has a glazed display case which is not often seen \u2013 but there are some modern changes such as a fridge replacing some lower shelving. On the right is a bar back where the lower part is old, presumed inter-war, but the top section is modern and the bar counter is wholly modern. There is an inter-war fireplace in the rear left room (but a loss of other fireplaces). The vestibule on the right hand side is modern.",

The bar back on the right is old with three bays with plain mirrors and shelves held up by pilasters with capitals. Lower shelving looks more modern as does the pot shelf. The left hand two bay bar back looks more 1960s with glass shelves.",

It has three prominent gables and the ground floor is tiled, but sadly these have been painted a hideous shade of grey. Saville Brothers were taken over by Charringtons in 1925.  \r\n\r\nThe pub has two main rooms, which are now connected. The former public bar is at the front and the saloon is to the rear. Between them is the servery. \r\n\r\nWhen you enter the public bar, it\u2019s apparent that the pub has seen better days. Fielded panelling has been painted in the ubiquitous off white we know too well. The counter is plain and probably dates from an interwar refit. The bar back looks a 60s job with its illuminated top section. \r\n\r\nThe saloon presents a more appealing prospect. The eye is drawn to the richly patterned coffered ceiling, a delightful feature. There is fielded panelling throughout, thankfully unpainted. Two baffles are still extant shielding the entrances to the gents\u2019 and ladies\u2019 loos. The counter, probably dating from an interwar refit, is an impressive affair which incorporates prominent pillasters. To the left of the servery is a dumb waiter. Here the bar back is also 60s work and incorporates illuminated Charringtons signage. The use of this saloon bar doesn\u2019t seem to be encouraged, and the exterior door is locked. \r\n\r\nWindows are largely modern replacements, although traces of Charringtons characteristic fenestration remain.",

        "Description": "Corner-site brick built post-war pub with a mansard roof. Built 1961/2 by Ind Coope, it is remarkable little-altered and therefore rare post-war pub. The most visible change took place in c. 2000 when the gents toilet was reduced in size to create a passage to link the two bars; also, the off sales is now a kitchen. On 1920s OS maps in this area there was a Black Boy Wood, which the pub may be named after? Has Taylor Walker lanterns fixed to the two chimney blocks.\n\r\nThe door on the right hand (Restons Crescent) side has a glass panel identifying it as the Public Bar, which looks original. The walls in the public bar are covered in plain and cheap-looking wood panelling to three quarter height with a row of tiles all along the bottom and another on the edge of the floor. The bar counter in here has vertical fluted panelling of a distinctive 1950s style with a piece of plain wood panelling for approx a foot just below the counter top. (The large pot shelf with a plain wood panelled front and \"The Boys Bar\" and \"Welcome to your Local\" in gold script on it is wholly modern). The bar back has a mix of glass and wood shelves, and at the top is coloured illuminated signage for \u2018Double Diamond\u2019 on the left, \u2018DD\u2019 symbol in the centre, and \u2018Long Life\u2019 on the right; the lower shelving remains intact. The large brick fireplace looks original with a tiled hearth painted red in front of it. The fixed bench seating is likely to be the original.\n\r\nThe Saloon bar is on the left of the building with its own access door from Southspring as well as being joined to the Public Bar via a short corridor. This room is carpeted, whereas the Public Bar is not. It also has plain wood panelling on the walls to three-quarter height with a row of tiles all along the bottom and another on the edge of the floor. The bar counter front has fluted panelling of a distinctive 1950s style, with, unusually (maybe a 1950s style decoration?) plain tongue and grove panelling of a height of about a foot slightly protruding out above it. The bar back in here backs on to the one in the Public Bar and is similar in style with a space for the old till. The lower shelving remains intact with fridges sensibly placed on the side. There is signage on the top with \u2018Double Diamond\u2019 on the left, the \u2018DD\u2019 symbol illuminated in the centre, and \u2018Skol Lager\u2019 signage on the right. There is an original brick fireplace with a tiled hearth around it painted red; the fixed seating looks original.\n\r\nThe passage linking the two bars was originally part of the gents toilet i.e. the doorways at each end of the passage were the doors to the gents\u2019 from each bar. Both ladies and gents toilets have no old fittings. On the corner of the pub there was until c.1978 an off sales \u2013 the now blocked-up door is on the Reston Crescent side and on the Southspring side there is what looks like a shop window also now blocked up. The space occupied by the off sales is now a kitchen with the counter removed.",

It has an array of small mirrors in the upper tier, and above that an elaborately carved pediment with a centrally mounted clock. The counter looks old, but is sadly painted white and has a new top. Opposite the servery is a fireplace with a fine wooden chimneypiece.\n\nA substantial timber screen with high level glazing separates this room from that at the rear.A broad opening has lost its folding doors and is flanked by sturdy twin pilasters. Beyond, the former billiard room has a skylight which is now blocked up. The large room on the left hand side of the pub was presumably the saloon bar, and  boasts fielded panelling (painted!) and a richly decorated ceiling.",

The former description is shown below. \n\nAccordingly to a seemingly very well-researched information notice in the rear room, it was rebuilt in 1898 under architect K. D. Young. Now we have a front bar but with only one front door, and a smaller back room.  There seems no real need for divisions at the front since this would have been a workmen's boozer where people crammed in the smallish space and there is only one fireplace. The counter is almost certainly original (very simple): bar-back prob. replaced. Fireplace '30s or '50s?",

        "Address": "499 High Road, London, Tottenham, N17 6QA",
        "Description": "There is record of a coaching inn on the site going back to 1610 but what we see now is a smaller, late Victorian establishment. Built of brick over three storeys the exterior has strong features including the pub name in a lozenge-shaped panel on the balustrade, prominent, proud lettering for the pub name, two panels sporting plaster bas-reliefs of a ship, two large lanterns and a ground floor lavishly covered in green glazed tiles. A former Taylor Walker pub.  \r\n\r\nOut of three former external doors, only those on the left and right are still functioning and open direct into a single bar. The door to the right of the building has a richly tiled dado in what might well have been formerly a passageway to the rear saloon. There is glazed screening to indicate where some of the entrance lobby might have been, although it seems that the screens could have been moved. The right wall of this side of the bar continues with the glazed tiling of the dado, in rich colours and showing panels with a floral motif, although sadly much of it is hidden by seating. There is a Victorian cast iron fireplace with a broad mantelpiece supported by four columns over which is an oval mirror with a decorated surround, all in cast iron. \r\n\r\nThe left side bar is more plain and seems to have been the public bar, as indicated on the disused door with the etched word \u2018Public\u2019. The wall has a wooden slatted dado which has been painted. There is a large and splendid old Taylor Walker mirror. The markings on the bar and the site of old doors suggest originally two small private bars or snugs to the front, which would have originally created a four-room pub. \r\n\r\nThe island bar in the centre has a pleasing curved, rectangular shape with an old solid wood countertop and solid wood surround. The central stillion is imposing, although the top section looks to be a more recent addition. The ceiling is painted Lincrusta with intricate embossed patterns. At the rear is a section for games and a staircase that is partially tiled in green glaze with a brown trim, which ascends part way up the stairs in odd fashion, appearing to peter out. There is a Guinness mirror in the stairwell.",

The curved wooden bar counter front also looks very 1960s with a Formica top. The bar back is a mixture of old and new with glass shelves being a feature of c1960 pubs and ribbed hardboard at the to (recently painted grey) which is seen in 1960s pubs.

At the front there is a curved stone counter front which could be of any age but possibly 1960s with a wooden top. The bar back is as described for the public bar. Fixed seating looks 1960s and there is a very c.1960s stone fireplace. \r\n\r\nAn unusual pointed arch of azed wood leads to a games room / area with another curved stone counter front which is 1960s work with a wooden top. The (bare) bar back fitting looks 1960s with some ribbed hardboard at the top and sides (recently painted grey) and glass shelves. At the rear is a stone fireplace almost reaching the ceiling with could date from c.1960, more 1960s fixed seating; also a pool table on a modernish lino tiled floor. The gents toilet is little altered.",

Both are rendered and painted cream.\n\nThe 'Hotel Entrance' door leads into a short passage with the small public bar on the left. The bar counter is very old though panelling was added to the front after a flood in the early 1960s. The only change to the gantry since the 1940s is the replacement of a table and till below the window with a fridge. The unusual lower part is said to have come from a church as part of the 1940s refit - it comprises a row of cupboards near the floor with open shelves above. The top part of the gantry has two more shelves held up by pillars - the date of this section is uncertain but could also be from the 1940s. A panelled dado runs round the room with old benches attached and a baffle by the door. The old stone fireplace now contains a log burning stove; in the beam above it is the 'Tramp's Hole' where once upon a time coins were placed so that vagrants could be bought a drink. The flagstone floor has apparently been turned over in recent times.\n\nA door leads to another room with a bare wood floor and a pool table. The counter again looks old but with newer panels attached along with a formica top. The gantry is confined to some old lower shelving and some more on the wall above. The 'half-timbering' and anaglypta on the walls is 1960s work and the fixed seating and fireplace are probably post-war.\n\nThe single storey part currently operates as a cafe.",

The corner entrance lobby has colourful Victorian floor tiles. In 1963 the adjoining house was acquired and a new lounge created and the public bar refitted and there are many 1960s fittings remaining. \r\n\r\nThe dimly lit public bar has a bar counter from 1963 to which more modern panels and frames containing football colours have been added to the front. The counter was moved back by a foot or so in the late 1960s \u2013 it originally reached the post holding up the ceiling. The walls are covered by 1960s wallpaper that looks like fielded panelling and the fixed seating is of a similar date. The gantry is more of the \u2018wallpaper\u2019 with optics attached. Along the bottom of the top half of the gantry is a row of the ribbed glass that can be seen on the lounge bar counter. In 1963 there was a snug situated on the right end of the servery, which was accessed via the middle door on the Lochlands Street side, and has been combined with the public bar. \r\n\r\nThe lounge has its own entrance and a shallow vestibule. It contains a very 1960s canted bar counter of plywood with a row of ribbed glass along the top of most of it. The wooden top is of sapele and when opened the new room was called the \u2018Sapele Lounge\u2019. The top part of the gantry dates from c.1990, one third of the 1963 lower section remains (rest lost to fridges). The fixed seating is in seating bays re-leatheretted and there is a ply panelled dado. Ceilidh  every Thu 8pm in the lounge.",

On the Balmore Street side there are four stained glass windows with in the centre of them painted Scottish countryside scenes  and one of a harbour. Sadly, they are difficult to fully appreciate from the inside as a shelf has been fixed across part of the them. On the Dura Street side are two more similar windows but the centre panels are \u201cWines\u201d and \u201cSpirits\u201d black on white wording only. Further along to the right are three narrower windows also with more stained windows. \r\n\r\nThe corner and right-hand exterior doors lead to the L-shaped public bar implying it was once divided into two; the left hand door on Dura Street leads into a vestibule and beyond to a passage which leads to the lounge bar. On the left hand side of the passage is a dado of old panelling and close to the lounge door is a plain mirror, an ornately carved pillar with capital holding up an entablature (?) that almost reaches the ceiling with a ?dog teeth? cornice topped with a tiny version of the double broken pediment on the gantry. The mahogany top section continues across the top of the lounge door and meets the gantry. On the right hand side of the passageway there is a near full height screen of two bays with colourful stained panels above a plain dado that looks post-war work. Then there is a small old bar counter i.e. matching the main counter front, and above it an arch shaped opening in the partition. Locals say this area just before the door into the lounge was called the \u2018Bully\u2019 which sounds like it was an off sales? \r\n\r\nThe bare wooden floored public bar retains an over 100 year old gantry facing two sides and curves in the middle. It is of five bays with carved pillars holding up the shelves, a row of mirrors in the central part of the upper section, and in bays one and four a carved frieze, and topped off here are, unusually, double broken pediments. The lower part of the gantry has carved pillasters holding up the shelves, some cupboards and retains half of the lower part (the other half lost to fridges). The panelled bar counter which looks old curves in the middle and on the right. It has pilasters, a number of match strikers just below the top and two broken water taps. The partition around the dart area is modern. All around the room is old dado panelling and a modest cornice. Fixed seating is modern. No sign of a fireplace. The lounge looks like it was refitted in the 1980s? but does have a colourful (modern) stained glass window.",

Other early 1960s items are the azed wood on \u2018beams\u2019 including two hollow main beams and copper top tables. \r\n\r\nThe area of the public bar at the rear left was a cellar until c.1970. The additional section of the room has been made carefully to match the front very 1960s looking fixed seating. If you look closely, the two baffles in the far left area are of s different style to the two in the front left area. \r\n\r\nA lounge was created in the early 1970s and is unchanged since. There was a joinery at the rear with the woodstore on the ground floor (now the cellar) and joiners shop above. The lounge is accessed from the rear of the public bar up a staircase to the first floor. The gents\u2019 looks original and the ladies\u2019 toilets were added in the 1970s when the lounge was created. The pub has a legendary juke box with discs from Jimmy Shand to Def Metal.",

After a spell as a restaurant (which saw the removal of a number of old fittings), the Victoria Bar is once again a pub. The Victoria Bar had been joined to the Clutha Vaults via the gardens of both pubs prior to the helicopter crash of 2013 and the former Clutha Vaults is now a room at the rear. \n\nThe bar retains its Victorian four-bay gantry with some modern changes and only some of the lower shelving survive. The original bar counter survives with match strikers all the way along it, a few pilasters, and a couple of ornate brackets. A little of the full height wall panelling remains on the rear wall but modern fixed seating. \n\nA small separate snug on the left and part glazed partitions have been lost and the lounge on the far left (the conversion of a former fishmongers shop which was added post-war) is now a kitchen.",

        "Description": "The interior of Wintergill\u2019s was refitted in 1936 and this three roomed pub retains its original gantry, long panelled bar counter and ply panelling on the walls and attracts a mainly older clientele. \r\n\r\nIt is situated in the base of a late 19th century four-storey tenement. The lino floored main bar has a ten bay gantry with an Art Deco top section on bays one and nine and a clock (age) on the 5th bay. The top section has mirrored panels in all but two bays, and in the lower part are a cupboard & drawer in bay ten, and only four bays have fridges replacing shelving. On the wall above the gantry are a \u2018Lorimer & Clark\u2019s Pale Ales\u2019  and a \u2018Stones Best Bitter\u2019 mirrors. \r\n\r\nThe ply panelled tapered counter is the 1936 one situated on a plinth but has a modern top. The plan shows the bar counter is curved on the left but the present small section is straight indicating it is a modern replacement. The 1938 plan shows there was a \u2018carrying out dept.\u2019 on the front left on the public bar which no longer exists so maybe the new piece of bar counter dates from when it was removed? 1930s panelling to half-height all around the public bar, which continues down the staircase to the gents in the basement. Four columns with decorative capitals hold up the high ceiling, which has an ornate cornice. \r\n\r\nSeparated by a part glazed screen, the sitting room at the rear of the public bar remains but has few old fittings and acts as a dining room. \r\n\r\nIn 1938 the property on the left was added and the plans show a half circle bar was installed. The left hand room has a half circle bar counter but (says MF) a careful study of the plans and the room and it is clear it is a modern replacement and moved slightly towards the back of the room \u2013 but the mouldings in the ceiling above it indicates it may be in the same position? No other old fittings here. \r\n\r\nRudolph Kenna\u2019s \u2018The Glasgow Pub\u2019 says in 1939 the basement housed an Art Deco cocktail bar, but nothing of this survives now.",

        "Pub Name": "Princess of Wales",
        "Address": "1a Montpelier Row, Blackheath, SE3 0RL",
        "Description": "The pub is named after Caroline of Brunswick, Princess of Wales from 1795 to 1820, Consort to George IV who lived in Greenwich. This Three-storey stone-built pub was rebuilt in c.1865 by the Cator Blackheath Estates, who leased it to the City of London Brewery in 1888; it subsequently became a Hoare & Co, Charringtons and now Mitchells & Butlers pub.\n\r\nThe reason for the pub\u2019s inclusion here is the showy and splendid bar back on the left-hand bar which is dated c.1865 and therefore one of the oldest surviving bar-backs in the country. This comprises 2 bays full height to the ceiling with two twisted barley columns in black and gold either side of each bay topped with capitols in gold with a facia running the full length of the bar back with inscriptions advertising spirits and wines in gold lettering \u2018Champagne Brandy\u2019, 'Old Tom' (with a clock between the words) and \u2018Irish Whiskies\u2019. Each bay has plain mirror backs with glass shelving which look to be modern. The lower part has been lost to cooling cabinets.\n\r\nOn the right hand-side a 3rd bay is an entrance to an old kitchen and on the right-hand corner is a square projection with more of the original fascia and wording \u2018Liquers\u2019 and \u2018Cigars\u2019. This area looks to have been a dumb waiter, now with glass shelving. Both have similar twisted barley columns in black and gold paint. On the left-hand side of the bar is an entrance to a corridor and toilets with a frontage in a similar style to the bar back but looks modern. To the far left a panelled area which looks to be a modern addition.\n\r\nThe long bar to the rear on the right-hand side has a different style of bar back with the longer right-hand section having a plaster or moulded frieze at the top whereas the shorter left-hand section is much plainer. However, the wood seems to be more modern under the dark stain so looks to have been added in refurbishments by Bass, possibly in the 1970s. There have been further refurbishments in 2004 and 2015.\n\r\nThe Princess of Wales has long been associated with the egg-shaped ball \u2013 as well as being linked to Blackheath Rugby Club, the oldest in the world, the pub served as a changing room during the first ever international between England and Wales, played on the heath in 1871.",

        "Address": "270 Bexley Road, Erith, Northumberland Heath, DA8 3HB",
        "Description": "Rebuilt 1930 by the Dartford Brewery Company in classic inter-war style by building behind the original (1860s?) pub which was then knocked down. It is of 1930s brick with a mock-Tudor first floor and still retains three rooms (possibly 4 originally) with the loss of the off sales. There are two rooms at the front \u2013 the Public Bar and Private Bar \u2013 and you go down the right hand side of the pub for the Saloon Bar entrance. \r\n\r\nThe front left Public Bar has an oak door with the figure \u20184\u2019 on the back of it from the days of the licensing magistrates. It has a two-sided canted bar counter of diagonally laid panels (unusual for 1930s pubs) and with brackets regularly situated along it. The mirrored bar back looks to date from the late 1950s having an illuminated top panel with \u2018Royal Oak\u2019 on it in a style seen in Courage pubs. The walls are decorated with narrow strips of wood on a plaster background. There is a lovely curved seating in a bay window and what looks like a 1930s brick fireplace.\r\n\r\nWhen built there was an off-licence on the central part of the front with a curved bay window but this was removed in the 1990s. If you look at the brick around the central window it does have a slightly different colour indicating it may have been rebuilt using original bricks. Maybe the front facing part of the Public Bar counter was originally the off sales one? \r\n\r\nA doorway from the Public Bar leads to the Private Bar on the right (the front door has the figure \u20181\u2019 on the back of it) and there is another door on the side of the pub. Maybe the front one was the entrance for the off-licence? The walls have been treated with the strips of panels on plaster which here has grooves in it to give the impression it is wood panels. The bar counter is also a canted one of diagonally laid panels (unusual for 1930s pubs) and with brackets regularly situated along it. There is a 1930s brick fireplace. \r\n\r\nThe Smoke Room on the rear right has its own separate vestibule entrance with two doors (right one no longer in use) which implies this large room was originally two separate rooms? There is a long canted bar counter of diagonally laid panels (unusual for 1930s pubs) and with brackets regularly situated along it and it curves on the right side. The bar back is essentially the original one with \u2018The Royal Oak\u2019 painted in gold along the top and  some newer features such as glass shelves. The room has fielded panelling all around it to three-quarters height and also around the \u2018beams\u2019 (RSJ\u2019s). On the right is a classic 1930s brick fireplace and on the left a marble surround one with brick interior and a hearth. There is a door at the rear right with above it painted in gold \u201cLadies And Gents Toilets\u2019 \u2013 these were originally outside but in modern times a brick built passage has been built to give access to the toilets.",

The bar fittings look to date from the 1930s with a canted fielded panelled counter and around the base is a chequerboard trough that may indicate the refit was by Trumans. There is a break in the trough which may indicate there was an off-sales just opposite the front door. The modest bar back looks 1930s.

        "Description": "This ex Beasley\u00b9s of Plumstead house is a delightful rebuild of c1880 in a jolly red brick Queen Anne style with prominent half timbered gables. It is set back from the main road. According to the 1981 Camra London guide, there was a refurbishment around 1980 which took its toll of the pub's character. A further drastic refit by Bermondsey Pub Co. in 2016 saw the servery on the right-hand side truncated, thus marooning a section of the bar back. The pub is now a single L-shaped space, with a contiguous area at the rear on the L. There is an L-shaped servery; the counter appears to be Victorian but has sadly been painted a ubiquitous gastro shade.  \r\n\r\nThe bar back consists of 3 bays facing the front and 4 on the right-hand section. The coved top is supported by columns with decorated capitals: a clock is mounted above the central bay at the front. Pillars of lower shelves remain but now mainly fridges and some new shelves. Behind the columns are a series of etched mirrors. These seem rather free floating; the likelihood is that formerly they were incorporated within a suitable timber structure. Compare with the bar back at the White Ferry House in Pimlico.  \r\n\r\nOpened-up area on the left with fixed seating and an old fireplace painted a dull green colour? Left door has \u2018Public Bar\u2019 etched panels. Opened-up to rear room in modern times.  \r\n\r\nMuch etched window glass, some showing the eponymous lion.

        "Address": "Spink Hall Lane, Sheffield, Stocksbridge, S36 1FL",
        "Description": "Built 1960/61 (source: Brewery History Society website: List of Samuel Smith Old Brewery Ltd. Pubs) as part of the East Whitwell estate of 400 council houses by Samuel Smiths Brewery (Architect Unknown). The only significant subsequent change (date unknown) is the amalgamation of the public bar and lounge bar on the left by the removal of at least one wall (possibly two if there was an off sales between the two bars \u2013 original plan not yet located \u2013 information from locals). \n\nBuilt of brick with stone added to the front facing side only, it is mainly single-storey with a central section (out of four) that is of two storeys and the upper part has a frontage of render. It has a distinct exterior due to a massive chimney of stone rising above the two-storey part. \n\nThe left hand twin doors lead to a lobby and on the left is a disused telephone booth. Through the twin inner doors is a large room with two bar counters of brick with wooden tops that look original which implies it was two rooms originally (with maybe an off sales between them?). Similarly, the bar back fittings appear original - a two bay one on the left and a five bay one on the right each with mirrors in wood surrounds at the top and between them and the main shelf are light brown tiles. Some of the lower shelves have been lost to fridges. The three sections of fixed seating looks original with padded backs onto vertical panels \u2013 note the table in the far left hand corner where two pieces of fixed seating meet. At the rear of the room are ladies\u2019 and gents\u2019, both with terrazzo floors (ladies has a carpet on top) and original urinal in the gents\u2019 but wall tiles possibly replacements. \n\nThere are rough timber uprights on the wide opening to the right-hand part of the room which might indicate the layout was always like this but locals insist it was two rooms originally There is a large brick pillar and two widish openings to the left-hand part so if there was an off sales when built then walls would have originally met at the pillar but this is not obvious. There is a large, almost inglenook in style, brick fireplace on the right-hand front side with a small hearth. Lots of fake beams on the ceiling. \n\nThere is an internal corridor which runs across the front of the building connecting the two bars. Off this are a gents\u2019 (terrazzo floor but otherwise modernised) and a ladies\u2019 with another disused telephone booth between them. The right hand twin exterior doors lead to the corridor and through internal double doors is another large room believed to originally been a concert room but now the tap room. The original domed ceiling was also lowered to the current level. The servery has a sloping bar counter front which looks original but the raised vaneer panels are identical to those on the seating bays so added in the 1980s. There is a bar back of three bays \u2013 two long and one short one in the middle with mirrors in wood surrounds at the top and between them and the main shelf are light brown tiles, which continue on the right return. Some of the lower shelves have been lost to fridges. \n\nThere are two seating bays that have timber and glass sections along the top on both sides. There are raised timber panels on the outside of the bays which match those on the bar counter. A 1983 plan shows only one piece of L-shaped seating at the rear and none on the front side as it is the position of a darts board and \u2018oche\u2019. This means the seating bays are 1980s work. There is a polished parquet floor on the right-hand side of the room presumably from the days of its use as a function room? This area now houses a full sized snooker table. \n\nConclusion: It would be very helpful if sight of the original plans could be obtained. The likely changes to the layout could be considerable if originally three rooms (possibly with an off sales?) but the bar fittings appear original and few other changes apart from the fixed seating in what is now the tap room on the right. Worth at least Regional Inventory rating. (MS - Jan 2019)",

On right hand side the lower shelves are intact but the right hand side ones have been replaced by fridges. The room has old dado panelling recently painted a gastro grey colour. There is a small 1930s brick fireplace on the right with a coal fire. There is a wide arch to a rear area with panelling on the walls \u2013 old dado painted a gastro grey colour and above it more modern painted a cream colour. There is a window to the back of the servery that may have been a hatch in the past? A radiator sits in the front of what was a fireplace in the rear area. Modernised toilets.",

From old photos, this was possibly a Helmore & Brandon\u2019s Putney Brewery pub \u2013 a brewery that in 1884 changed into the name of A J Brandon only (from the London Gazette) and became Brandon\u2019s Putney Brewery Ltd.; acquired by Mann, Crossman & Paulin Ltd. in 1920 \u2013 the brewery closed in 1949.  \r\n\r\nInside is a U-shaped single room. Two doors in use and signs of a third in the middle so likely layout of two bars and off sales in the middle. Has fielded paneling in light oak to picture frame height. It has an almost horseshoe-shaped bar counter with a frontage of narrow vertical planks that are pointed at the bottom. The pub may have been subject to an inter-war refit by Mann, Crossman & Paulin Ltd. (The bar counter is similar to that at the Harlequin, Finsbury). On the far left is a 1930s brick fireplace. Good settles on the right and high-backed benches but likely to be more modern than old. \r\n\r\nThere is a separate counter on the rear right in the same style with an open kitchen behind it so possibly changes here.",

        "Description": "This pub of considerable charm and character appears on first sight to be of great antiquity, but closer inspection reveals that it has been subject to considerable alteration over the years. There was certainly a pub in the building in the 19th century, with the essentials of the current layout visible on plans dating from 1906, but the configuration of the interior was modified during or before 1947 and again in 1974. \r\nOn entering the main door, there is a small ground floor with two fireplaces. Wooden panelling on the walls is covered with old artefacts and memorabilia, although the majority were probably purchased and installed in the late 20th century, including the stoves which have been placed in the fireplaces. Old photographs suggest that the bar counter may be made from the timbers of an older bar, and the unusual beer engines date from the mid-19th century. The back of bar was probably constructed in 1974; there is an illuminated brewery logo on the fascia. The current bar was knocked together from a tiny public bar and smoke room, and the counter has at least been moved from the position it occupied between 1906 and 1947. Stairs lead to a small upstairs drinking area. \r\nA second set of stairs lead downwards to a lounge. This is again wood panelled with a fireplace at the rear of the room,. The floor consists of stone flags which may predate the mid-20th century modifications. Plans reveal that in the early 20th century the bulk of this area was occupied by a kitchen, but a larger space was created, probably during or before 1947 by the removal of the kitchen. The downstairs bar counter was installed at the same time. \r\nAlthough partitions have been removed, the basic early 20th century configuration in the ground floor and lower bars can still be detected. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the age of many of the fittings and the dates of the mid-century internal modifications, the pub is undoubtedly of Some Regional Interest.",

Internally it has a largely open plan which became the norm from the 1960s. The main drinking area wraps around the servery on three sides, but on the north-west corner there is a small, quasi-separate area leading off and which was presumably a games area. The servery fittings all seem original, simply detailed with a horizontally boarded counter and mirrored back fitting. At the north-east end is some very attractive wooden seating divided by arm rests. Below ground level there lies a substantial function room with partly original bar fittings and some excellent chunky wooden seats. The walls, both inside and out, are painted but this unfortunate (and short-sighted) treatment is likely to have been applied to original exposed brickwork.",

The first licensee is recorded in 1896 and presumably the building of the pub immediately prior. The three external doorways lead to what is now a single L-shaped bar but once there would have been wooden partitions creating subdivisions (they would not have been full-height since they have left no traces on the ceiling \u2013 which has some attractive cornice work and ceiling roses). The star feature is the counter with its bold, wide bays, each decorated with four long panels focused on a central rose-like motif. It bulges out in striking fashion into the drinking area creating a largish space which now houses a quite delicate, low octagonal fitment for bottles etc and which has interwar styling. The lower parts of the main bar back fitment are probably (like the counter) original to the building of the pub but the upper mirrored panels are really quite austere and their dating is problematical (perhaps from a similar time as the octagonal unit?). Note the three cast-iron columns providing support for the upper parts of the building. On the right of the pub is a single-storey space, open to the main area and which may represent an extension (its internal details are very plain).",

The first recorded licensee is in 1896 when the pub was probably newly built by Saville Brothers brewery of Stratford, who were taken over by Charringtons in 1925. \r\n\r\nAn off licence was located on the left hand side of the pub on the Francis Road elevation; this was in use until the mid 1970s but is now subsumed into pub use. The public bar is on the corner, with the saloon bar on the right reached via an original floor-to-ceiling screen. The screen is mainly matchboard panelled, has a doorway, with a door still in place, with three large stained glass glazed panels above, each containing five separate panels mainly of a floral theme, with the central rectangular ones featuring small birds at their centre. There is also a delightful small baffle on the bar counter side of the screen with four small glazed panels featuring floral designs, and again a small bird.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter in these rooms is old, possibly Victorian, with square panels in the various sections throughout. The upper parts of the central fitment (or waggon) in the centre of the servery look quite modern, although the woodwork forming the base looks older, if not original. Three iron columns with ornate capitals. survive, Walls all have matchboard wood panelling on the dado, and the graceful stairway with spindled handrail leading up from the saloon bar has a large floor to ceiling glazed panel at the bottom facing it. There is a further room at the back on the right, reached from the saloon bar via a very wide wood-framed arch. The bar counter in here looks more modern than that in the other rooms. All the original wooden panelling, plus the columns, are unfortunately painted a  light grey. \r\n\r\nOriginal stained glass panels survive in the upper portions of the outer windows; these are very similar in style to those in the screen, having mainly floral-themed small panels, again with small birds in the roundels of the central rectangular panels.",

        "Description": "Built about 1868 as Richmond was spreading over the spaces on Richmond Hill, this pub has a prominent position on a street corner, with a three-storey main block and a smaller, two-storey one on the right. An extension was added to the rear in 1924. The stand-out feature is a remarkably florid, mirrored bar-back, no doubt dating from the building of the pub. It has three faces within the L-shaped servery and a terrific display of classical columns and an entablature which has an elaborate cornice sitting on little modillions (that is, the rows of small square blocks on the underside). The panelled counter is very much plainer with simple recessed panels and little console brackets. \r\n\r\nOn the right-hand side was a saloon and here the fittings are very different with what looks like an interwar counter with rounded corners (it has a couple of (now sealed) doors for servicing beer engines). In fact it seems that there was probably more work done at the time, notably the installation of two brick fire surrounds, one on each side of the pub. It\u2019s hard to date the wall treatment with its applied upright timbers. The ornate Victorian fireplace on the left-hand side has, it seems, plaster decoration, and was resited here some years ago from upstairs. There has been quite a bit of opening up, especially on the left-hand side. There was formerly a function room upstairs and between 1985 and 1995 this operated as a small theatre for experimental productions: the upstairs parts were then colonised by the present 11-bedroom B&B accommodation. Hopefully you will not find the large expanses of magenta paint overpowering!",

        "Description": "There has been a pub on this site since at least the nineteenth century. The area, close to the Hogsmill River, had a number of mills processing coconut fibre into matting and other goods, hence the name. The current building dates from the early 1950s. Plans to demolish the original building and construct a new pub were approved in July 1939, but building was interrupted by the World War II. \r\n\r\nCharrington\u2019s Brewery (Architect S J Fennell) began a re-building in Spring 1940 but it stopped in August 1940 due to a shortage of steel. Work was completed by 1954 \u2013 it seems to have been constructed in the popular way of behind the original pub, which was then knocked down leaving parking space at the front of the new pub. \r\n\r\nThe pub is a two storey-building constructed of brick, with a tile roof, and two bow-fronted windows on the ground floor, with original leaded window panes with left-hand door having colourful leaded symbols including a coconut. There are separate entrance lobbies on either side of the building; a third entrance in the centre of the fa\u00e7ade, leading to the original off-sales area which has been bricked up. \r\n\r\nThere is a single, U-shaped bar in the centre of the pub, with 1950s panelling in pale wood, although the bar was shortened and new glass panelling installed at the rear after 1987. The back-of-bar shelving may also date from the 1950s and has the wording \u2018Wines\u2019, \u2018(blank \u2013 possibly \u2018Charrington\u2019s\u2019 originally)\u2019, \u2018Spirits\u2019 along the top on both sides, although modern refrigeration equipment has been installed at ground level. \r\n\r\nThe pub now consists of a single drinking and dining area (the establishment operates a Thai restaurant), although when originally constructed there were three distinct rooms \u2013 a saloon bar, a public bar, and a games room \u2013 plus and off-sales area. The public and saloon bars were knocked into a single space in the late 1980s, and a food servery constructed in the former games room. This was subsequently removed at an unknown date, when this smaller room seems to have been opened up and joined to the main drinking area. \r\n\r\nThe 1950s configuration of the bars is still apparent from the remains of the partition between the former saloon and public bars, which is interrupted by a U-shaped arch.  Similarly, a glazed half-partition also denotes the division between the main pub and the former games room. Former wooden doorways at the rear right-hand side of the pub remain, although the doors themselves have been sealed. The doorways in the two surviving entrance lobbies appear to date from the 1950s rebuild, but the left hand lobby has been considerably reduced in size. Much original woodwork and glass survive.",

First, you are greeted with mosaics in the flooring of the two entrances, the right-hand one with the name of the pub, the corner one hosting a rather malevolent-looking eagle; the date is not certain and they might even be as late as the inter-war period. The main feature inside is the L-shaped panelled bar counter, quite likely dating from Victorian days; evidently it has been cut back slightly on the left-hand side. Parts of the back fitting seem of similar age with the most distinctive feature being the coving at the top and its now indistinct relief decoration (the detached balusters seem part of modern alterations). At some stage a conservatory-style extension has been thrown out, quite possibly in the interwar period which seems to be the date for the leafy stained glass (the mighty eagle in the skylight is much more recent). Originally the pub would have had several internal divisions, including one in the centre entered by a now-blocked in doorway. Around the internal perimeter are sturdy iron columns; note the lunette window over the corner entrance still has a working opening arrangement.",

        "Pub Name": "Midland Hotel",
        "Address": "29 Station Road, Hendon, NW4 4PN",
        "Description": "This is an old railway hotel, built in 1889-90 to serve the nearby Midland Railway station. The handsome frontage includes a broad decorated arch over the main entrance to the pub. The date of construction is inscribed over the arch, and also in a bas relief panel in the centre of the first-floor balcony. \r\n\r\nThe large front bar has been created by knocking together at least two smaller rooms and an off-sales area. Two doors open into the bar from a rectangular central vestibule: a third door or opening for off sales has now been blocked off, and a corner door into what used to be a separate saloon bar has also been blocked. The wooden panelled counter and the back of bar are of no great antiquity, but some older wooden panelling survives on the wall to the right of the bar as you face it and around some of the windows. The ceiling is patterned with deep relief - with a tessellation of octagons and squares to the left of the bar, and with diamonds set in large divided squares to the right (the different patterns appear to confirm that this space was formerly two separate rooms). There is a surviving bell push to the right of the fireplace. The upper parts of the arch-shaped windows are leaded, with a fan pattern in the left-hand part of the room and rather surprising Art Deco-style motifs to the right. \r\n\r\nThe rear room, accessible through a door space to the left of the front bar counter, has a curved counter which appears older than that in the front. It has wooden edging with a dark green inlay. The bar back consists of grey-painted wooden panelling which again appears older than that in the front bar. A well-crafted modern glazed partition separates the front and rear serving areas. An old skylight has recently (2018) been exposed by the removal of a false ceiling, but the walls of this room have been stripped of old panelling and the fireplace is modern. \r\n\r\nIn sum, although there has been a considerable amount of modernisation and modification, the old layout of the pub can still be discerned and several features of interest survive from earlier days.",

A two-storey and attic building of red brick and stone on the ground floor with impressive chimneys. The fascia has \u2018Wines\u2019,  \u2018London Stout\u2019, \u2018Spirits\u2019 and \u2018Off Sales\u2019 on the Harrow Road side and \u2018Wines\u2019 and \u2018Spirits\u2019 and more covered over on the Warfield Road side. Also a curved \u2018William IV\u2019 on the corner. Closed in 2014 it has been refurbished and reopened in 2018 with 15 guest rooms. It retains a lot of its original fittings in four rooms. \r\n\r\nFront left door has a vestibule and leads into the large Main Bar with a bare wood floor, interwar fielded panelled bar counter with cupboard for servicing beer engines and a marble top added in recent years. The bar back is actually a close copy of the original one and painted a dark grey colour. There is a dado of interwar fielded panelling also painted a dark grey colour and a 1930s brick fireplace. Look for the coloured glass panes in the front windows. \r\n\r\nAt the rear left there is a wooden wide arch presumed to be interwar through which is another room with more interwar fielded panelling also painted a dark grey colour, and a 1930s brick fireplace. However, the bar counter is modern and there is a return section of the replacement bar back here. \r\n\r\nOn the corner is the Nelson Room connected to the main bar by a narrow arch cut into the wall in recent times. This has a vestibule from the disused corner door with a \u201cPrivate Bar\u2019 brass plate on it. On the exterior is an iron gate and a terrazzo floor in the exterior lobby. This small room has a quarter circle interwar fielded panelled bar counter with cupboards, a checkerboard tiled apron around the base, and a marble top added in recent years. There are two bar back fittings \u2013 a three bay one and a single bay one at right angles with an wooden lined arch for staff between them. Around the walls is a dado of interwar fielded panelling also painted a dark grey colour and a 1930s brick fireplace. \r\n\r\nBeyond the Nelson Room is a red tiled lobby with blue painted fielded panelling and a staircase to the guest rooms on the first floor. The Clarence Room at the rear has another quarter circle interwar fielded panelled bar counter with cupboards, a checkerboard tiled apron around the base, and a marble top added in recent years.  The three-bay bar back is from the inter-war period. This larger room with a bare wood floor is available for functions and has a better quality 1930s brick fireplace. The gents here have three interwar urinals but modern tiling.",

It has stone mullioned windows (leaded glass in the upper sections) and a glazed stone dado on the ground floor. There are three external doors but only the large entrance in Kilburn Lane is in use. The external lobby has on the right-hand side above the dado a ceramic panel in bas relief of a scantily-clad lady grape-picking. There is a similar panel at the Rochester Castle, Stoke Newington N16. It has a matching interior of some opulence but has undergone a revamp with a shabby-chic makeover. \r\n\r\nDouble doors lead into the main bar with a bare wood floor, a good moulded (Lincrusta?) ceiling, and a frieze around the room. The panelled bar counter (with a modern zinc top) and two bar back fittings (painted a cream colour) with a doorway for staff between them may be old (difficult to date). Around the room is some fielded panelling. On the right-hand side is the reading room with dado panelling that might be old but the wood surround fireplace looks modern. Beyond is a snug situated at the base of a staircase with two large decorative tiled panels of alternating plain tiles and ones in relief. This area looks more like a lobby i.e. their unusual position indicates changes to the room. \r\n\r\nAt the rear is a large dining room with a modern bar counter and a plain bar back painted a light grey which might be old but more likely modern. Around the walls is fielded panelling that does look inter-war and a good wood surround fireplace not in use. There are at least three more rooms upstairs. \r\n\r\nHow much of the original fixtures and fitting remains open to question, and clearly there has been some opening up of the interior.",

A door with etched glass panels leads to the principal room from the Earls Court Road. Facing you is a classic probably Victorian counter fitted with brackets and an unusual patterned fascia beneath the counter top. The three-bay mirrored bar back looks old and is fitted with glass shelves. The central bay incorporates an opening to the rear room. Especially attractive are the twin mirrored columns either side of the bays and at each end, which have decorated capitals. \r\n\r\nThe rear room may be accessed from either side. The startling feature here is the splendid display of timber and etched mirrors on the inner wall. Clearly this is the former bar back - the counter has been removed, thus stranding it. At the far (north) end of the room is an attractive wooden fireplace which looks old; it has a mirrored overmantel. Behind the erstwhile bar back stairs lead to the cellar.",

        "Description": "A beerhouse originally dating back to 1836, this is an attractive middle-of-terrace two-storey pub, refronted in the ground floor with brick, seemingly in the interwar period. That refurbishment scheme also left us with numerous fittings in the two rooms.  \r\n\r\nThe two front doors lead into an L-shaped bare wooden floored room on the right so maybe an off-sales on the left hand side is lost? The L-shaped bar counter has an inter-war front but a ceramic top added in 2017 replacing an earlier formica one. There is a 1930s brick fireplace painted black at the front right with a real coal fire in winter, but the bar back is modern. On the walls is a heavy wallpaper (anaglypta?) which is a treatment used to make the walls appear to be panelled. \r\n\r\nThere is clear evidence that this room has been extended in modern times (confirmed by locals who say the room was smaller in the past). The far end of the bar counter is a modern add-on \u2013 possibly the counter originally was curved back to the wall. Also, if you look carefully you will see the treatment of the walls in the rear part of the room is different to that at the front indicating it has been done to copy the walls at the front part of the room. Sadly, all the wall treatment has recently painted battleship grey. Some beams have adzed wood (tooled with an adze to make it look old) and there is an imitation beam at the rear.  \r\n\r\nA widish doorway leads to the small left hand room that has a carpet and old dado painted black. The brick fireplace looks more likely to be 1950s (than 1930s), and has been painted black. The small counter is more like a hatch and has a counter front that is different to the right hand side but possibly 1930s (or later?) but the bar top looks 1930s.",

        "Description": "An imposing landmark pub, rebuilt in 1886, on the road from Hammersmith to Shepherd\u2019s Bush. With three storeys (plus attic) it overlooks the eponymous green while the now-culverted brook is said to run beneath the pub. The ground floor is of stone with red brick above and on the first floor \u2018Brook Green Hotel\u2019 in stone relief with the wording picked out in black on white. Like so many pubs of its day, it doubled as a hotel and, indeed, still has good-quality letting bedrooms. Unsurprisingly, it has been considerably remodelled internally and opened out (the four external doors would have led to separate areas) but it still retains one star feature \u2013 an impressive mirrored bar-back with three gablets each above a Renaissance-style grotesque mask (mirroring one on an external panel).  \r\n\r\nOther features to look out for are the impressive Classical-style fireplace on the right (with flecked white marble inset), two stained glass panels (left-hand-side) depicting kings (one is evidently David, identified by his harp), and attractive cornices in the ceiling. The bar counter looks old and has recently been painted a claret colour. Modern alterations and partition removal leave us with a few puzzles: what is the meaning of the lower ceiling on the left, apparently with metal panels, and how does the varying ceiling cornice treatment relate to the original arrangements? The rear right-hand area is quite plain and its bar back fitting (left) seems entirely new.",

        "Pub Name": "Hop Poles",
        "Address": "17-19 King Street, Hammersmith, W6 9HR",
        "Description": "The Hop Poles is an amalgamation of two earlier houses with the lower wing on the right being converted into a pub in 1857. In 1903 it was a Barclay Perkins pub. It is a three-storey building of brown brick with a ground floor of granite faced with pilasters flanking the four entrance doors. Near the right hand doors is a brass sign \u201cSaloon & Luncheon Bars\u201d and above it a \u2018The Hop Poles Hotel\u2019 mirror. The interior layout is much changed over the years and now has a centrally situated servery facing four directions. \r\n\r\nThe two main entrance doors lead into a front bar. The door on the right has intact and attractive mosaic tiling. The left hand door has a plain step with two leaded, stained glass panels above featuring floral motifs and richly bordered. There was a refurbishment of the entire pub in 2018 in which modern tiling was added to the front bar area but the wooden bar back is retained. It features an integral engraved mirror also with floral motifs flanked by tall side panels with mirrors in wooden frames that are also engraved. The lower shelving has been replaced by fridges. The bar front has been painted but was probably established in earlier years, consistent with left return. An old service hatch has been sealed and the bar counter appears to be a recent addition. The bar has a ribbed ceiling consistent with the right return. There is one cast iron pillar with a Corinthian capital at the junction of the front bar and left hand bar. \r\n\r\nThe left return has an old bar counter but fresh panels have been added to the front and painted a dark blue colour. The bar back is of five and a half sized bays with bay three being a doorway for staff. Bays one, four and the narrow one have etched and cut mirrors, but bay two only wood panels. The white tiles were added in 2018. Most of the lower shelving has been lost to fridges. \r\n\r\nThe right-hand area room is announced on the exterior dado as the Saloon. It has been opened up in recent times to the former Public Bar on the left side of the pub. It\u2019s not over large and is harmoniously proportioned. There is an impressive timber and etched mirrored bar back. However, as is often the case when pubs are refurbished, it is now marooned as the counter has been done away with. There are two bays against the left-hand (east) wall and three against the back (north) wall. In the centre of the latter a disused door also benefits from an etched mirror. Otiose chalk boards are mounted on two of the bays, very likely concealing more mirrors. The room has an attractive moulded ceiling. \r\n\r\nAt the rear of the room are a set of double doors, which look old and contain etched glass. These lead to the rear part of the pub (the former Luncheon Room). Above them a set of attractive etched windows. \r\n\r\nThrough the doors a single door on the left signed \"private\", and leading to the rear of the central servery, contains an etched/cut pane with floral design matching in design all other glazing in the pub. Probably Victorian. The most arresting feature of the back room is what appears to be an intact Victorian bar back that backs on to the rear of the servery. Four bays, each with a floral decorated mirror at its centre, and at the top a further semi circular and similarly decorated mirror above a carved wooden crosspiece. At the centre of the bar back is a central floor to ceiling wood-framed piece protruding approx a foot from the back, containing some shelving and also with semi circular mirrors to the top and sides. \r\n\r\nUntil circa 2007 the bar counter extended to front the east half of the aforementioned bar back, when it was truncated. In previous years it will have fronted the whole piece. A metal fireplace at the back on the right, with damaged tiling, looks modern. \r\n\r\nA modern archway, in a relatively modern wall, separates this room from a smaller rear room to the east that at one time was a cocktail bar, which in turn is separated from the front area of the pub by what appears to be vestiges of Victorian screening still containing some cut glass panes. Above the modern archway in the rear area sits a wood-framed piece of screening with a semi-circular top, which is, of course, not in situ, and probably re-sited during earlier internal alterations.",

There are two small doors on the Evershed Walk side (old photo from 1942 showed four doors in two pairs on this side). There are no signs of any former off-sales. \r\n\r\nEntrance through the first door into the front bar with a small wood panelled counter with a pot shelf suspended from a dropped ceiling projection above the bar counter.  The bar counter looks to be possible interwar but the pot shelf and bar back look to be of more modern construction. \r\n\r\nA wide opening on the right leads to a room at the rear, again with a bar counter similar to the front one (but subtly different in many respects) also with a modern pot shelf and suspended ceiling projection. There is plenty of fielded panelling to three quarter height and a 1930\u2019s style brick fireplace on the left-hand side surrounded by the same fielded panelling. To the right of the fireplace there is a part glazed wall/partition with similar fielded panelling which backs onto a passage to another room to the left which seems to have been brought into use as a dining room in recent times (dates unknown). Again, this room has similar fielded panelling but looks to be more modern as does the panelling in the passage. \r\n\r\nIn the rear bar there is cushioned fixed bench seating along the right-hand wall to the rear and a collection of 1930s style chairs and stools. Bare floor boards in both rooms and the ceiling in both bars is red painted wallpaper with narrow transverse wood beams. Opens at 5 Mon to Fri.",

Now opened up the pub was a three-roomer: a smallish space on the right, entered through the front door is clearly distinguishable but the main bar on the left, rather less obviously, had two spaces, one entered, as now, through the side door and its internal porch, and another from a (now blocked) entrance on the corner. Otherwise modest original fittings including a plain panelled counter to the three-sided servery and parts of the bar back: the etched window glass with geometrical patterning is probably also original to 1926.",

        "Description": "An imposing early Victorian pub built about 1850 (both 1847 and 1858 are claimed as the date). Three-storey of London brick with a glazed brown brick dado on the ground floor.  It has a lovely cast-iron balcony running across the first floor which is supported on iron columns forming a sheltered verandah below. The layout has two large public rooms which are entirely separate (very unusual these days) and require you to go outside to get from one to the other. The public bar on the left is L-shaped and seems an amalgamation of two spaces (see the now-closed double door left of the present entrance).There is a fine Victorian bar-back facing the entrance with vertical, decorated mirror strips at the sides and fine cut-glass panels within the three bays: old counter, now painted blue, and a matchboard dado, now painted \u2018gastro-green\u2019. What a pity the plaster has been hacked off in two places to expose the rough brickwork behind (would you do that in your own home?!).\r\n\r\nOn the right is a large saloon (so named on a big door-plate) which is set partly within the main building and partly within a single-storey block. The glazed brick dado running across the entire frontage of the pub ties the two parts together externally but is certainly later than the original build and may well date from the interwar period. Was the main part of the saloon added on at that time? It\u2019s curious that the counter seems Victorian but that the half-height wall panelling (very ordinary work) and a couple of attractive settles seem interwar. Perhaps this side of the pub was very much smaller and the counter is a relic of that.",

This single storey extension seems to have been built in the 1990s, a planning application from 1997 suggesting that it replaced an earlier games room which was demolished. \r\n\r\nThe canted main bar counter has a wooden top below which is cream-painted, fielded panelling.  The panelling on the front and right hand side of the counter appears to date from the interwar period; that on the left hand side of the counter seems to be much newer.  As well as the usual access door and flap, there is a (now closed) hinged door below the counter which might have provided access to a bank of pumps which has since been removed.  The bar back appears to be inter-war.  A large polygonal alcove to the left of the bar may have been constructed as a snug (the exterior of the building suggests that, although old, this extension might have been constructed later than the main building).  This alcove contains wooden fixed seating with floral motifs.  The bar area is panelled throughout to picture rail level.  The wooden panelling is painted dark brown to the left of the bar and cream to the right, and is of uncertain age. \r\n\r\nThere are three entrance doors to the main bar \u2013 a main, double door and a single door with vestibule to the front of the pub, and a single door on the left hand wall (as viewed from the front).  A fourth door on the left hand wall has now been bricked up.  This suggests the existing bar was originally divided into three or more rooms (one of which might have been an off-sales area), but it is now impossible to detect where these divisions might have been.  There are four ceiling roses containing pendant lights.  Some sash windows contain patterned frosted glass .\r\n\r\nThe rear pool room is painted red above dado level, with modern brown painted panelling below.  An exterior door leads to the rear garden.  This room does not contain a servery.",

Further down the passage on the left is the off sales hatch, which also serves the lounge that is situated on the right. This has fixed seating around the room that looks 1960s work, but has lost its fireplace and there is some 1950s ribbed hardboard in evidence. \r\n\r\nThe main bar has a red tiled floor, large bar counter curved at the front and straight at the rear with 1960s ply panelling on the front and the wooden top is possibly older. The brick fireplace could date from the late 1950s (or late 1930s) and the dado has c.1960 ply panelling. At the rear of the red tiled hallway is a room on the right with a figure \u20183\u2019 on it. The toilets further down the passage at the rear left with a latch door. Opens at 6 Mon to Fri.",

The canted counter with its beauty-board front is from the original conversion and the bar-back is of glass shelves onto mirrors. Also in the room are brick fireplaces from at latest the 1950s and old dado panelling with some benches attached. A further small room can be found on the left. The pub was due to change hands in mid-2019 with the new owners intending to make improvements - so a check before visiting is advisable. (these changes have now taken place. It is reported that the canted counter has been altered, part covered over and painted gastro-green. The canopy structure over the bar has gone, as has the glass bar-back, replaced with wooden shelves. One brick fireplace now has a modern wood burner in it. We have not yet formally re-assessed the pub but it looks like its inventory credentials are now very dubious)",

The 1962 lay-out remains throughout.\n\nFrom the front door there is a lobby. The left hand door leads into the lounge bar with a parquet floor. A 1962 photograph confirms the dado panelling and some full height panelling around the servery are 1962 work but are now painted grey. The bar counter is 1962 but recently painted. Only a door in the bar back appears to be from 1962: the rest is modern. There is a stone fireplace wit display shelve from 1962 and a small piece of fixed seating to the right; the bay window seating looks 1962 work, but a backing has been added. Up three stone steps is a snug which was created from an old kitchen. This retain the 1962 stone fireplace with modern woo added around it. The fitted seating around the room looks like it is from 1962.\n\nThe public bar on the right has been totally refitted with possibly, the base of the bay window seating dating back to 1962. The gents urinals look to date from at least 1962, possibly earlier. Outside, this ex-S.H.Wards pub has a unique stone \u2018Crown and Glove\u2019 logo. The name is a reference to the gauntlet thrown down on Coronation Day by the Royal Champion, daring anyone to dispute the right of succession. The tradition was established by William the Conqueror and was last observed, in 1821, at the coronation of George IV.",

The 2011 refurbishment resulted in the modern bar back with small coloured tiles which is at odds with the 1930\u2019s three quarter height wood panelling that runs throughout the interior.  The bar counter is formed of large wooden panels divided by plain carved columns topped with decorative brackets.   \r\n\r\nThere is a passage behind the bar leading to the toilets and stairs to the upstairs (private). At the back of the left hand room is a large fireplace. The white painted ceiling is divided up into oblong sections with moulded cornices.  There was a fireplace on the left hand wall in the front bar but this is now covered up by the wood panelling. On the opposite right hand wall is another fireplace. Bare polished wooden floor boards (modern) with new quarry tiles at the front of the bar counter. Note the thin band of coloured terrazzo along the bottom of the bar counter which may have been part of a trough but now gone or covered over by the new quarry tiles.  The large right hand vestibule has stairs leading down to the Cosy Kettle Cocktail bar. Look for the tubular steel and leather backed chairs which look to be of 1930s vintage .",

Three-storey ex-Wenlock Brewery Victorian pub of London brick with larvikite on the ground floor and with good carved plasterwork decoration in the spandrels. Old photos show Wenlock and Bass signage on external walls. Locally listed in Hackney as a Victorian public house.  An old, undated plan appears to show two bars \u2013 a saloon and a public bar \u2013 on either side of a central staircase, rather than the layout described below. No information exists about when this layout was modified, but reports suggest a substantial refurbishment in 2010-11 when some (further?) opening up seems to have taken place.   \n\nThe pub has five original doors, but only one is now in use. There is a long bar on the Green Lanes side with a very good vestibule entrance with curved etched-glass windows but a modern tiled floor. The bar counter in this room is old/original with modern panels added and painted grey. The bar back is good featuring an engraved mirror and other plain mirror panels. Parts of the wooden structure may have been replaced relatively recently, but the etched glass is likely to be old. On the right are (rare) two mirror panels where the lower one rises and there is a (non-working) dumb waiter. Good cornice in the main bar. Good wood surround fireplace on the right with excellent mantelpiece with mirrored sections with the main one being an old \u2018Bass in Bottle\u2019 mirror. There are two good ceiling roses. There are remnants of former partitions which have been shortened and possibly moved from their original positions. Here, some glass contains transfers and is not genuinely etched. The wide opening on the rear right of the bar leads to a modern, open kitchen. \n\nThere is also a wide opening between the main bar and a smaller bar to the rear left of the pub. Here, there is an old curved bar counter, possibly inter-war, in unpainted wood; a quarter circle old bar back in decorated wood contains sconces with casks in them which are not in use. This seems likely to be older than the servery in the main bar. There is another Bass mirror in this room (marked \u201cBO\u201d on the bottom). Good arch for staff within servery with carved wood decoration in the spandrels. \n\nThe upstairs room has no old fittings.",

Note the two brass plates on the pilasters (right one lost?) with the wording \u201cCognac Brandy\u2019 and \u2018Jamaica Rum\u2019 with holes indicating the existence of spirits cocks originally which dispensed drinks stored (and blended?) on the first floor. Other examples can be found at the Cock & Bottle, Notting Hill.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the bar back, the counter is very plain with recessed panels \u2013 all painted a pale green colour \u2013 and the top is a later addition. Dado panelling on the left wall is dated? - also painted a pale green colour. Another fireplace on the right with a stone surround painted black is possibly from the 1920s but the overmantle is an import. The odd piece of fixed seating might be old.",

        "Description": "Built circa 1845-50 for Calvert Brewers (Then Hoare & Co and Charrington). Three storey brown stock brick with stucco ground storey and dressings. Frontage on both Princess Road and Gloucester Avenue probably later 19th century. \r\n\r\nThe main bar area is now a single room with two doors to the street.  Bar counter in this room is old, and possibly original, with scrollwork atop the vertical supports, and canted forward. There is fielded panelling to dado level, and surrounding the windows. The counter front and all the panelling has been stripped of paint and varnish. The bar back is mainly modern, but a small three-bay section on the corner angle is old. It has a relatively modern clock in the centre near the top, and any glazing in the bays has been lost to, or is obscured by, chalkboards. The serving counter beneath this section of the bar back is also old. \r\n\r\nA second much smaller room is reached via a doorway (no door) on the left, in a single storey adjunct to the main building, and is too narrow to have been a billiards room. It has its own, now unused, door to the street, and its own small bar counter that is not canted except for an end piece by the door separated from the rest of the counter by the staff access hatch. The scrollwork on this counter is slightly different in design to that in the main room so looks like modern work carefully created to match the main bar one. At the back and to the right of this room is a third room behind the servery. This room is very plain and may have been brought into pub use at some stage, but does have a small serving hatch to the servery.",

Retains fully intact 1960s 'Take Courage' signwriting on exterior along with Courage Cockerel sign. It is of three-storeys with the two top floors of mock-Tudor / half timbering and on Hawley Street side a single-storey narrow extension. The pub has staged live music and taped tracks played to heavy metal/goth genres.  \r\n\r\nOriginally three rooms (including a Bottle & Jug?) it is now a U-shaped single bar having lost partition walls. The walls have fielded panelling to three-quarters height all around which has been painted black. External windows leaded throughout with some replaced. Bar counter has fielded panelling front painted black and still has an almost continuous heating pipe with short section missing where broken at point where hatchway door remains. Bar back plainly mirrored with original leaded panels but some replaced. Has remnants of a central dumb waiter now defunct/part-replaced with fridges as has most shelving likewise leaving approx. one-third intact.  \r\n\r\nAn original fireplace with a brick surround has a more modern insert but overall effect spoilt by protruding, somewhat crude, bench seating structure, built possibly post-war, and joined to bar back. Main doorway used today, to Kentish Town Road, retains its vestibule, and near the former separate vestibule entrance on Hawley Crescent side (now used as a fire exit) is an interesting fixed bench seating likely to be original. Original narrow door to gents, with matching panelling, retained but similar doorway to ladies is wider. Facilities within both updated.",

        "Description": "This handsome 3 storey neo Classical edifice was built c1854 as the Queens Hotel. It adroitly turns the corner between St Georges Terrace, facing Primrose Hill, and the elegantly curved shopping street of Regents Park Road. The ground floor facing the hill is apsed and at one time was adorned with a statue of Shakespeare.  \r\n\r\nThere were originally three entrances on Regents Park Road but the central one has been replaced by a window. The left hand entrance has a semi vestibule \u2013 perhaps it was formerly fitted with a curtain? The ground floor is tiled, but naturally they have been painted over. Even the Charrington's Toby Jug logos have not been spared.  \r\n\r\nThe public bar was originally on the right \u2013 the saloon to the left. Perhaps a private bar between them? The interior is now a single space, and  the servery faces you as you enter. A striking feature of the section to the right is that two of the walls are mirrored. This appears to be old work. However, the woodwork has been painted, which spoils the effect. Interestingly, there is a disused doorway in the corner.  \r\n\r\nThe counter could possibly be Victorian \u2013 unfortunately, it has been painted. The mirrored barback to the right looks interwar; that to its left is modern. Behind the servery, a flight of stairs ascends to the room above. The far left hand end of the pub is raised and acts as a snug. Here Kingsley Amis and his friends used to hold court.  \r\n\r\nAdjacent to the left hand entrance is a second staircase. Since this was the saloon bar, it ascends in an attractive timber housing, and above the stairs is an elaborately framed mirror built into the fabric. The room upstairs is a single space. There are etched windows bearing the legends \u201cBilliard Room\u201c and \u201cPool Pyramids\u201c - this last is very unusual (they were an early form of pocket billiards). \r\n\r\nThe windows on the ground floor possess some excellent stained glass, largely in the transom windows but also in some of the main ones. There is a good Victorian cast iron fireplace in the former saloon.",

This is a small pub reminiscent of an old ale house, although opened up to become a one-room pub. There are two doors to the street and the left-hand door is in use, leading to an inner door which is marked \u2018saloon\u2019 in stained glass. There is attractive mosaic tiling in the porch. Inside the door is attached the number \u20181\u2019, which reflects the requirement from licensing magistrates to number each section of a pub, a system which was in use until the 1950s. \r\n \r\nMarkings on the floor suggest a diagonally placed partition has been removed to create the single space, losing what would have been a small public bar on the front right and more generous saloon from the left hand door going back to the rear. There are attractive old pub mirrors, including one for Lacons ales, and pew-style seating. The long thin bar leads to a small garden at the rear.  \r\n \r\nThe pub has old dado railing on walls to about one-third height. In the salon area on the left beneath the dado is stained or lacquered textured wallcovering. To the right in what would have been the public bar there is old tongue and groove wood panelling below the dado. The large centre window between the two doors has plain old wood panelling beneath. The fireplace on the left side has a hefty metal surround and glazed decorative tiling on its interior as well as on the fireplace hood. The flooring around the hearth is plain tiling. The fireplace is in Victorian style but may be a reproduction dating from an inter-war refurbishment. \r\n \r\nThe bar itself is solid wood and the counter appears intact possibly from the inter-war years.  The bar back consists of intact lower shelving and is backed by white tiling with a frame of brown tiles, which are typical of inter-war interior refreshments, but no upper structure. There is a floor to ceiling screen at the rear also of wood, which creates a space for access to the ladies\u2019 toilets and to private space. The gents\u2019 is outside and still features porcelain urinal.",

The corner door to this is now disused. The current public bar has a dartboard within - a notable feature here is a newer 'chandelier' made from old brown beer bottles - which suggests a swap between public and saloon bars has occurred at some time. Current saloon also features similar 2/3rd height panelling with a fireplace (though modernised), an open wooden staircase and fielded front panels to the bar counter from the interwar refit. An impressive brass plate above the bar top acts as a bank of sixteen light switches individually labelled in a named sequence. \r\n\r\nThe two rooms are connected at the rear via a third room (part of the extension) which has a another fireplace with herringbone brick infill and there is a mixture of modern and aged panelling, the former predominating at full height.

        "Address": "Mountbenger, TD7 5LE",
        "Description": "Built c.1780 as a coaching inn with additions in 1820 \u2013 it was on the Edinburgh to Stranraer route. In the mid 1940s the public rooms were re-fitted and on the left is the public bar with a bare wood floor. It has a three-sided bar counter with a distinctive front of a 1950s style and three shuttered openings that can rise and fall and are still intact but no longer used. The counter had been painted and in about 2005 it was returned to its original (light oak) wood finish. Note the bell push in the pillar between bay one and two. The gantry looks more 1960/70s but is painted a deep red colour so not easy to date \u2013 it has some glass shelves in the top section, wooden shelves below and there is a modern brick fireplace with a log burner.\n\r\nThe left hand bar was the original public bar and accessed via a door on the left (in old photographs) that is now a window and about 20 years ago the doorway was cut through the wall to the right former residents bar. The right hand bar has a single bay still working shuttered bar counter that is also intact and has a beaten copper top. Note the bell push on the left side of the counter. There is a new brick and slate fireplace with a log burner. There is a dining room at the rear with old dado panelling painted a sage colour and an old wood surround fireplace with wood burning stove. It can be used for folk music concerts.\n\r\nIt claims many famous visitors such as Sir Walter Scott \u2013 there is a plaque \u201cAt this inn, in the autumn of 1830 Sir Walter Scott and the Ettrick Shepherd met and parted for the last time\u201d - & James Hogg (Robert Burns stayed here and there is a plaque on the wall, R L Stevenson? And Wordsworth wrote poems about the Yarrow Valley etc.)",

        "Description": "Early 17th century three-storey building which until the 1950s operated as a boot and shoe shop on the ground floor. It was restored and a mock Tudor frontage added in 1956 and opened as a pub on various levels. It has half timbered walls, a wealth of beams and timbers, and old brick fireplaces.\n\r\nMain bar is on the first floor with access via a staircase from the small front bar or walk up the lane on the right-hand side of the building and enter by the door half way up. It has a bar counter with a linenfold front from the 1950s and the bar back shelves might well be 1950s. Bare wood floor throughout first floor. Up a further six steps is another small room / area and further on the left (down three steps) is a pool room where the fittings are very modern.\n\r\nThe small ground floor bar has a flagstone floor and another linenfold bar counter from 1956 and bar back shelves might be 1950s, old brick fireplace inglenook-style. However, the bar counter was originally on the right and moved across so that the staircase to the first floor could be added.",

        "Address": "1 Club Row, London, Spitalfields, E1 6JX",
        "Description": "Some of the late Victorian interior of this pub has survived \u2013 in particular three large original Victorian glass advertisement panels for brands of spirits etc.  These are remarkable survivors as it closed as a pub in 1994 and has been an Art Gallery, Restaurant and re-opened in its present guise as Dirty Bones Restaurant in 2017.\r\n\r\nThree-storey building of grey brick re-built 1880 (date in stone parapet(?) at the top of the building). The existence of five original doors indicate it was divided into a number of small room separated by partitions originally. From the left hand door on Bethnal Green Road there is a mosaic floor which would have been a partitioned entrance to the separate Saloon Bar (wording on a door). There is also a tiled dado on the left hand wall of green tiles and three tiled panels in pale ochre.  \r\n\r\nAbove the tiled dado are three impressive ornamental gilt Victorian glass advertisement panels 'Martell Hennessey's Pale and Brown Brandies'; Knave of Clubs Family Wine and Spirit Stores' and 'Choice old Pure Malt Scotch and Irish Whiskies'. Such advertising panels were widely seen in London in Victorian times but now very few remain \u2013 there are two impressive ones in the Tipperary in Fleet Street.  \r\n\r\nThe bar counter, which looks to be the original but now painted an off white colour, has moved \u2013 it was originally to the left and forward of its present position to create the small saloon where the mirrors are situated. It has a modern brass top.   \r\n\r\nSadly, in the period 1994 to 2017 the equally impressive mirrored arcading that was situated under what might be described as a canopy over the present servery has been destroyed. A photo (plate 37 in \u2018Pubs of Tower Hamlets by Tony Philips (London Borough of Tower Hamlets (1988)) shows the decorated fluted columns with capital foliage \u2013 now painted cream \u2013 with the arcading situated just behind it.",
